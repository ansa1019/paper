item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, particularly under the heading "risk factors."
overview we are primarily engaged in the development, manufacturing and sale of our proprietary omnipod insulin management system (the "omnipod system"), an innovative, discreet and easy-to-use insulin infusion system for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. the omnipod system features a unique disposable tubeless omnipod which is worn on the body for approximately three days at a time and the handheld, wireless personal diabetes manager ("pdm"). conventional insulin pumps require people with insulin-dependent diabetes to learn to use, manage and wear a number of cumbersome components, including up to 42 inches of tubing. in contrast, the omnipod system features two discreet, easy-to-use devices that eliminate the need for a bulky pump, tubing and separate blood glucose meter, provides for virtually pain-free automated cannula insertion, communicates wirelessly and integrates a blood glucose meter. we believe that the omnipod system's unique proprietary design offers significant lifestyle benefits to people with insulin-dependent diabetes.
in june 2011, we acquired neighborhood holdings, inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, "neighborhood diabetes") in order to support our sales of the omnipod system, expand our full suite diabetes management product offerings and obtain access to a larger number of insulin dependent patients. through neighborhood diabetes, we are able to provide customers with blood glucose testing supplies, traditional insulin pumps, pump supplies and pharmaceuticals and have the ability to process claims as either durable medical equipment or through pharmacy benefits.
we began commercial sale of the omnipod system in the united states in 2005. we sell the omnipod system and other diabetes management supplies in the united states through direct sales to customers or through our distribution partners. the omnipod system is currently available in multiple countries in europe through our exclusive distribution partner ypsomed distribution ag ("ypsomed") and in canada. we have been selling our new omnipod system since 2013. the new omnipod system is more than one-third smaller and one-quarter lighter than the original version, while maintaining the same features and operating capabilities. all customers have been transitioned to the new omnipod system.
we sell our proprietary omnipod system as well as blood glucose testing supplies, traditional insulin pumps, pump supplies, pharmaceuticals and other products for the management and treatment of diabetes to people with diabetes. through our infrastructure in the reimbursement, billing and collection areas, we are able to provide for adjudication of claims as either durable medical equipment or through pharmacy benefits. claims are adjudicated under private insurers, medicaid or medicare. as we expand our sales and marketing focus, increase our manufacturing capacity and expand to additional international markets, we will need to maintain and expand available reimbursement for our product offerings.

our sales and marketing effort is focused on generating demand and acceptance of the omnipod system among key diabetes practitioners, academic medical centers, clinics, people with insulin-dependent diabetes, third-party payors, government agencies, and third-party distributors. our marketing strategy is to build awareness for the benefits of the omnipod system through a wide range of education programs, social networking, patient demonstration programs, support materials, media advertisements and events at the national, regional and local levels. we are using third-party distributors to improve our access to managed care and government reimbursement programs, expand our commercial presence and provide access to additional potential patients. our total revenue was $288.7 million, $247.1 million and $211.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
we currently produce the omnipod system on partially automated manufacturing lines at a facility in china operated by a subsidiary of flextronics international ltd. ("flextronics"). we purchase complete omnipods pursuant to our agreement with flextronics. under the agreement, flextronics has agreed to supply us, as a non-exclusive supplier, with omnipods at agreed upon prices per unit pursuant to a rolling forecast that we provide. the current term of the agreement expires in december 2017 and is automatically renewed for one-year terms subsequently. it may be terminated upon prior written notice given no less than a specified number of days prior to the date of termination. the specified number of days is intended to provide the parties with sufficient time to make alternative arrangements in the event of termination.
we seek to increase manufacturing volumes and reduce the per-unit production cost for the omnipod. by increasing production volumes of the omnipod, we have been able to reduce our per-unit raw material costs and improve absorption of manufacturing overhead costs. our new omnipod was designed to further lower the cost of the product through component sourcing, volume discounts and efficient manufacturing. we continue to seek to sustain or reduce our per omnipod cost through reductions in the bill of material as well as through manufacturing efficiencies. we believe our current manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our expected 2015 demand for omnipods.
we purchase certain other diabetes management supplies from manufacturers at contracted rates and supply these products to our customers. based on market penetration, payor plans and other factors, certain manufacturers provide rebates based on product sold. we record these rebates as a reduction to cost of goods sold as they are earned.
since our inception in 2000, we have incurred losses every quarter. in the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred net losses of $51.5 million, $45.0 million and $51.9 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $578.0 million. we have financed our operations through private placements of debt and equity securities, public offerings of our common stock, issuances of convertible debt and borrowings under certain other debt agreements. as of december 31, 2014, we had $201.3 million of convertible debt outstanding which matures in june 2019. since our inception, we have received net proceeds of $725.0 million from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock, common stock and debt.
our long-term financial objective is to achieve and sustain profitable growth. our efforts in the beginning of 2015 will be focused primarily on the expansion of our customer base in the united states and internationally. achieving these objectives is expected to require additional investments in certain personnel and initiatives. we believe that we will continue to incur net losses in the near term in order to achieve these objectives. however, we believe that the accomplishment of our near term objectives will have a positive impact on our financial condition in the future.
at december 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $151.2 million. we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, together with the cash expected to be generated from product sales, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and debt service requirements for the next twelve months.
financial operations overview revenue.  we derive most of our revenue from the sale of the omnipod system and other diabetes related products including blood glucose testing supplies, traditional insulin pumps, pump supplies and other pharmaceuticals to customers and third-party distributors who resell the product to customers. the omnipod system is comprised of two devices: the omnipod, a disposable insulin infusion device that the patient wears for up to three days and then replaces; and the pdm, a handheld device much like a personal digital assistant that wirelessly programs the omnipod with insulin delivery instructions, assists the patient with diabetes management and incorporates a blood glucose meter.

in june 2011, we entered into a development agreement with a u.s. based pharmaceutical company (the "development agreement"). under the development agreement, we were required to perform design, development, regulatory, and other services to support the pharmaceutical company as it works to obtain regulatory approval to use our drug delivery technology as a delivery method for its pharmaceutical. over the term of the development agreement, we invoiced amounts as we met certain defined deliverable milestones. revenue on the development agreement was recognized using a proportional performance methodology based on costs incurred and total payments under the agreement. the impact of changes in the expected total effort or contract payments were recognized as a change in estimate using the cumulative catch-up method. as of december 31, 2013, we met all required deliverables under the development agreement.
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 we had deferred revenue of $1.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively. these amounts primarily include product-related revenue.
for the year ending december 31, 2015, we expect our revenue to continue to increase as we gain new customers in the united states, continue expansion in europe, canada, and certain other international markets and continue to seek out new drug-delivery uses for our technology. increased revenue is dependent upon the success of our sales efforts and our ability to produce omnipods in sufficient volumes as our patient base grows and is subject to other risks and uncertainties, including the potential for a reduction in on-hand inventory levels amongst our distributors.
cost of revenue.    cost of revenue consists primarily of raw material, labor, warranty and overhead costs such as freight and depreciation related to the omnipod system and the cost of products we acquire from third party suppliers. cost of revenue will continue to increase as our revenue increases; however, we expect our gross margin to improve as we continue to seek to sustain or reduce our per omnipod cost.
research and development.    research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our product development, regulatory and clinical functions, and the costs of market studies and product development projects. we expense all research and development costs as incurred. for the year ending december 31, 2015, we expect overall research and development spending to increase from our 2014 spend as we increase development efforts on our on-going projects including continued improvements to the manufacturing process of the omnipod system, the development of the new pdm, the integration with continuous glucose monitoring technology, the development of the type 2 pump with lilly and the ability to use our technology as a delivery platform for other pharmaceuticals.
general and administrative.    general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the executive, finance, information technology and human resource functions, as well as legal fees, accounting fees, insurance costs, bad debt expenses, shipping, handling and facilities-related costs. for the year ending december 31, 2015, we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as compared to 2014. in 2014, we incurred significant one-time costs related the resolution of our outstanding litigation with becton, dickinson and company and expenses related to the retirement and transition of certain executives.
sales and marketing.    sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our sales, marketing, reimbursement support, customer support and training functions, sales commissions paid to our sales representatives and costs associated with participation in medical conferences, physician symposia and promotional activities, including distribution of units used in our demonstration kit programs. we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the year ending december 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 as we expand our commercial team and invest in initiatives that will enhance awareness and drive increased adoption of the omnipod system.

comparison of the years ended december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013
revenue our total revenue was $288.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to $247.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in revenue is mainly due to the continued adoption of the omnipod system by patients in the united states and internationally. this increase was offset by a reduction in revenue related to certain mail-order diabetic testing supplies such as blood glucose testing strips and lancets to medicare beneficiaries that we no longer are eligible to service under the medicare durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies ("dmepos") competitive bidding program, which took effect on july 1, 2013.
international sales accounted for 18%, 10%, and 8% of total revenue during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, and 2012, respectively.
cost of revenue cost of revenue was $145.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to $134.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase is due to higher sales volumes in the united states and internationally. these increases were partially offset by lower per-unit costs of the omnipod system resulting from cost savings on raw materials, volume discounts from our suppliers and increased absorption of manufacturing overhead driven by increased production volumes.
research and development research and development expense increased $6.1 million, or 28%, to $27.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to $21.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily a result of increased spending on certain key development projects and included a $3.3 million increase in employee related expenses, mainly comprised of costs related to the addition of employees and increased stock-based compensation. additionally, we incurred a $2.0 million increase in consulting and temporary labor related to our development projects and a $0.5 million increase in supplies and consumables.
38
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased $2.7 million, or 4%, to $66.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to $64.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase included approximately $9.1 million related to management retirement and transition costs, an increase of $1.2 million in employee related expenses including stock compensation and $0.5 million in infrastructure costs. the increase was partially offset by a year over year decrease of $4.0 million in legal expenses, a $2.5 million reduction in expense for equipment no longer being used which was recorded in 2013, a decrease of $0.9 million in amortization expense related to the customer relationship asset acquired in the june 2011 acquisition of neighborhood diabetes, and a decrease of $0.7 million in shipping expenses.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense increased $5.1 million, or 9%, to $60.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to $55.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily a result of an increase of $3.5 million in employee related expenses including management transition costs and stock-based compensation and costs related to the addition of employees as we continue to expand our sales force. additionally, we incurred a $1.2 million increase in costs associated with marketing campaigns and other advertising costs.
interest and other expense, net interest and other expense, net increased $23.4 million to $39.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $15.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily related to the loss from extinguishment of long-term debt of $23.2 million which was recorded in connection with the 2014 repurchase and conversion of the outstanding $143.8 million in principal amount of 3.75% notes.
income tax expense income tax expense was $0.1 million for both of the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. income tax expense is comprised of a current and deferred portion. the current portion primarily related to state and foreign taxes and the deferred portion primarily related to federal and state tax amounts.

sales and marketing sales and marketing expense increased $3.0 million, or 6%, to $55.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, as compared to $52.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. this increase was primarily a result of a $0.8 million net increase in costs associated with the launch of the new omnipod system and other advertising expenses and a $2.2 million increase in costs related to customer support functions and strategic planning initiatives.
interest and other expense, net interest and other expense, net was $15.7 million for both the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012. in the year ended december 31, 2013, interest and other expense, net primarily consisted of non-cash interest expense on the 5.375% notes and the 3.75% notes based on their effective interest rates and the $0.3 million inducement charge recorded for the extinguishment of debt related to the exchange of 620,122 shares of common stock for $13 million in principal amount of the 5.375% notes (as defined below). this expense was offset by $1.4 million of other income representing the fair value of the call feature related to $59.5 million of modified 3.75% notes. in the year ended december 31, 2012, interest and other expense, net primarily consisted of non-cash interest expense on the 5.375% notes and the 3.75% notes based on their effective interest rates.
income tax expense income tax expense was $0.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to $0.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. income tax expense is comprised of a current and deferred portion. the current portion primarily related to federal, state, and foreign taxes and the deferred portion primarily related to federal and state tax amounts.
liquidity and capital resources we commenced operations in 2000 and to date we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of common and preferred stock, secured indebtedness, public offerings of our common stock and issuances of convertible debt.
as of december 31, 2014, we had $151.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, together with the cash expected to be generated from sales, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months.
equity in january 2013, in a public offering, we issued and sold 4,715,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $20.75 per share. in connection with the offering, we received total gross proceeds of $97.8 million, or approximately $92.8 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

5.375% convertible senior notes in june 2008, we sold $85.0 million principal amount of 5.375% convertible senior notes due june 15, 2013 (the "5.375% notes"). the interest rate on the notes was 5.375% per annum on the principal amount from june 16, 2008, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on december 15 and june 15 of each year. the 5.375% notes were convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 46.8467 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 5.375% notes. the 5.375% notes were convertible for cash up to their principal amount and shares of our common stock for the remainder of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount.
in june 2011, in connection with the issuance of $143.8 million in principal amount of 3.75% convertible notes due june 2016 (the "3.75% notes"), we repurchased $70 million in principal amount of the 5.375% notes for $85.1 million, a 21.5% premium on the principal amount. the investors that held the $70 million in principal amount of repurchased 5.375% notes purchased $59.5 million in principal amount of the 3.75% notes and retained approximately $13.5 million in principal amount of the remaining 5.375% notes. the investors' combined $73.0 million in principal amount of convertible debt ($13.5 million of 5.375% notes and $59.5 million of 3.75% notes) was considered to be a modification of a portion of the 5.375% notes. see the section entitled "3.75% convertible senior notes" below for additional detail on the modification accounting.
in may 2013, we entered into an exchange agreement with a holder of our 5.375% notes. under the exchange agreement, we purchased $13 million in principal amount of the 5.375% notes in exchange for 620,122 shares of our common stock and a cash payment of $0.3 million, representing accrued and unpaid interest. furthermore, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million for the impact of the inducement which was included in interest and other expense in the year ended december 31, 2013.

there was no cash interest expense related to the 5.375% notes in the year ended december 31, 2014. cash interest expense related to the 5.375% notes was $0.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. no non-cash interest expense related to the 5.375% notes was recorded in the year ended december 31, 2014. non-cash interest expense related to the 5.375% notes was $0.3 million and $0.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
as of december 31, 2013, the 5.375% notes were repaid in full and no amounts remained on our balance sheet related to these notes.
3.75% convertible senior notes in june 2011, we sold $143.8 million in principal amount of 3.75% notes. the interest rate on the notes was 3.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on december 15 and june 15 of each year. the 3.75% notes were convertible into the our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 38.1749 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.75% notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $26.20 per share.
we identified certain features related to a portion of the 3.75% notes, including the holders' ability to require us to repurchase their notes and the higher interest payments required in an event of default, which are considered embedded derivatives and should be bifurcated and accounted for at fair value. we assessed the value of each of these embedded derivatives at each balance sheet date. at december 31, 2013, we separately accounted for the call feature related to the possibility that we could redeem the 3.75% notes, at our option, beginning june 20, 2014, for the modified portion of the 3.75% notes. we determined that the fair value of this feature was approximately $1.4 million and included this amount in other assets and as other income at december 31, 2013. the call feature had no value at december 31, 2014 as there was no principal amount of the 3.75% notes outstanding.
in connection with the issuance of the 3.75% notes, we repurchased $70 million in principal amount of the 5.375% notes for $85.1 million, a 21.5% premium on the principal amount. the investors that held the $70 million in principal amount of repurchased 5.375% notes purchased $59.5 million in principal amount of the 3.75% notes and retained approximately $13.5 million in principal amount of the remaining 5.375% notes. this transaction was treated as a modification of a portion of the 5.375% notes. we accounted for this modification of existing debt separately from the issuance of the remainder of the 3.75% notes.
prior to the transaction, the $70 million principal of repurchased 5.375% notes had a debt discount of $10.5 million. this amount remained in debt discount related to the $73 million in principal amount of modified debt. we recorded additional debt discount of $15.1 million related to the premium payment in connection with the repurchase and $0.2 million related to the increase in the value of the conversion feature. the total debt discount of $25.8 million related to the modified debt was amortized as non-cash interest expense at the effective rate of 16.5% over the five-year term of the modified debt. we paid transaction fees of approximately $2.0 million related to the modification, which were recorded as interest and other expense at the time of the modification.
of the $143.8 million in principal amount of 3.75% notes issued in june 2011, $84.3 million in principal amount was considered to be an issuance of new debt. we recorded a debt discount of $26.6 million related to the $84.3 million in principal amount of 3.75% notes. the debt discount was recorded as additional paid-in capital to reflect the value of our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 12.4% per annum. this debt discount was being amortized as non-cash interest expense over the five-year term of the 3.75% notes. we incurred deferred financing costs related to this offering of approximately $2.8 million, of which $0.9 million was reclassified as an offset to the value of the amount allocated to equity. the remainder was recorded as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and was being amortized as non-cash interest expense over the five-year term of the 3.75% notes.
in june 2014, in connection with the issuance of $201.3 million in principal amount of 2% convertible senior notes due june 15, 2019 (the "2% notes"), we repurchased approximately $114.9 million in principal amount of the 3.75% notes for $160.7 million, a premium of $45.8 million over the principal amount. investors that held approximately $80.0 million of 3.75% notes purchased approximately $98.2 million in principal amount of the 2% notes. the repurchase of the 3.75% notes was treated as an extinguishment of debt since the fair value of the conversion feature changed by more than 10%. the extinguishment of the 3.75% notes was accounted for separately from the issuance of the 2% notes. the $160.7 million paid to extinguish the debt was allocated to debt and equity based on their respective fair values immediately prior to the transaction. we allocated $112.4 million of the payment to the debt and $48.3 million to equity.
the 3.75% notes were convertible at the option of the holder during the quarter ended june 30, 2014 since the last reported sales price per share of our common stock was equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 of
42
the 30 trading days ended on march 31, 2014. the 3.75% notes and any unpaid interest were convertible at our option for cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock.
beginning on june 20, 2014, we had the right to redeem the 3.75% notes, at our option, in whole or in part, if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock was at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days. in june 2014, we met the redemption requirements and notified holders of our intent to redeem the outstanding $28.8 million in principal amount of 3.75% notes in july 2014. prior to the redemption date, holders of $28.5 million in principal amount of 3.75% notes notified us that they exercised their right to convert their outstanding 3.75% notes. we settled this conversion of the 3.75% notes in july 2014 by providing cash of $28.5 million for the principal amount of the outstanding 3.75% notes converted and issuing 348,535 shares of common stock for the conversion premium totaling $12.6 million, for total consideration paid of $41.1 million. we settled the redemption of the remaining $0.3 million in principal amount in exchange for a cash payment of $0.3 million representing principal and accrued and unpaid interest. we allocated $27.9 million of the total consideration paid to the debt and $13.5 million to equity.
we record a loss on extinguishment of debt of $23.2 million in connection with the repurchase and redemption of the 3.75% notes during the year ended december 31, 2014, representing the excess of the $140.3 million allocated to the debt over its carrying value, net of deferred financing costs.
cash interest expense related to the $143.8 million in principal amount of 3.75% notes was $2.4 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 and $5.4 million in each of the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012. non-cash interest expense related to the 3.75% notes was $4.9 million, $10.8 million and $9.6 million in the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
as of december 31, 2014, no amounts remain outstanding related to the 3.75% notes.
2% convertible senior notes in june 2014, we sold $201.3 million in principal amount of the 2% notes. the interest rate on the notes is 2% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on december 15 and june 15 of each year. the 2% notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 21.5019 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2% notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $46.51 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.
in june 2014, in connection with the issuance of the 2% notes, we repurchased approximately $114.9 million in principal amount of the 3.75% notes for $160.7 million, a premium of $45.8 million over the principal amount. investors that held approximately $80.0 million in repurchased 3.75% notes purchased approximately $98.2 million in principal amount of the 2% notes. the repurchase of the 3.75% notes was treated as an extinguishment of debt since the fair value of the conversion feature changed by more than 10%. the extinguishment of the 3.75% notes was accounted for separately from the issuance of the 2% notes. see 3.75% convertible senior notes above for additional detail on the extinguishment accounting.
we recorded a debt discount of $35.6 million related to the 2% notes. the debt discount was recorded as additional paid-in capital to reflect the value of our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 6.2% per annum. this debt discount is being amortized as non-cash interest expense over the five year term of the 2% notes. we incurred deferred financing costs related to this offering of approximately $6.7 million, of which $1.2 million has been reclassified as an offset to the value of the amount allocated to equity. the remainder is recorded as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and is being amortized as non-cash interest expense over the five year term of the 2% notes.
we determined that the higher interest and tax payments required in certain circumstances are considered embedded derivatives and should be bifurcated and accounted for at fair value. we assess the value of the embedded derivatives at each balance sheet date. the derivatives had de minimis value at december 31, 2014.
cash interest expense related to the 2% notes was $2.3 million in the year ended december 31, 2014. non-cash interest expense related to the 2% notes was $4.0 million in the year ended december 31, 2014.

44
cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily a result of our net loss offset by non-cash expenses. adjustments for non-cash and other items were $71.5 million and $41.8 million in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. in the year ended december 31, 2014 non-cash and other items include a loss of extinguishment of debt of $23.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $12.2 million, stock-based compensation of $22.5 million, non-cash interest and other expense of $10.3 million, and provision for bad debts of $3.3 million. in the year ended december 31, 2013, non-cash and other item included depreciation and amortization of $11.8 million, stock-based compensation of $12.7 million, non-cash interest and other expense of $9.7 million, provision for bad debts of $4.7 million, impairment and other charges of $2.5 million, and a loss of extinguishment of debt $0.3 million.
cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december 31, 2014 included an increase of $1.4 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.7 million. these changes were offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of $10.1 million and an increase in inventories of $3.6 million. the increase in accounts receivable largely relates to the timing of shipments to customers and overall expansion of our customer base. the increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities is primarily related to timing on vendor payments.
cash provided by operations in the year ended december 31, 2013 included a decrease in inventories of $5.4 million and an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $10.4 million, offset in part by a decrease of $4.5 million in deferred revenue and an increase in accounts receivable of $4.5 million. the decrease in inventories and increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities are largely related to the scale up of our manufacturing operations as we transitioned our customer base to our new omnipod system. the decrease in deferred revenue related to the recognition of revenue billed in prior periods as we met the revenue recognition criteria. the increase in accounts receivable largely related to the timing of shipments to customers and overall expansion of our customer base. uses of cash from operations in the year ended december 31, 2012 include an increase in accounts receivable of $13.5 million and an increase in inventories of $3.0 million. these increases were offset in part by an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $3.0 million and a $2.9 million increase in deferred revenue.

cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december 31, 2014 was mainly related to the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and common stock related to exercises of employee stock options offset by our repayment of debt and payment of taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units during the period. cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december 31, 2013 was mainly related to the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the public offering and the exercise of employee stock options. cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december 31, 2012 was related to the exercise of employee stock options.
commitment and contingencies we lease our facilities in massachusetts, new york, florida, and singapore. these leases are accounted for as operating leases. the leases generally provide for a base rent plus real estate taxes and certain operating expenses related to the leases.
45
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we entered into a new lease agreement for approximately 90,000 square feet of laboratory and office space for our corporate headquarters in billerica, massachusetts. the lease term began in august 2014 and expires in october 2022 and contains escalating payments over the life of the lease. also during the year ended december 31, 2013, we extended our singapore lease which now expires in july 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we amended our existing lease for warehouse space in billerica, massachusetts. in addition to extending the term, we increased the approximate square footage under the lease. the lease now expires in september 2019. additionally, in the year ended december 31, 2014 we amended our existing lease for office space in new york which now expires in january 2019. our florida lease expires december 2015.
certain of our operating lease agreements contain scheduled rent increases. rent expense is recorded using the straight-line method and deferred rent is included in other liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet.
shareholder rights plan in november 2008, our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan (the "shareholder's rights plan"), as set forth in the shareholder rights agreement between us and the rights agent, the purpose of which is, among other things, to enhance the ability of the board of directors to protect shareholder interests and to ensure that shareholders receive fair treatment in the event any coercive takeover attempt of us is made in the future. the shareholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring us or a large block of our common stock.
in connection with the adoption of the shareholder rights plan, our board of directors declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right (a "right") for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on november 15, 2008. in addition, one right will automatically attach to each share of common stock issued between november 15, 2008 and the distribution date. the rights currently are not exercisable and are attached to and trade with the outstanding shares of common stock. under the shareholder rights plan, the rights become exercisable if a person or group becomes an "acquiring person" by acquiring 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or if a person or group commences a tender offer that would result in that person or group owning 15% or more of the common stock. if a person or group becomes an "acquiring person," each holder of a right (other than the acquiring person) would be entitled to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, such number of shares of our preferred stock which are equivalent to shares of common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the right. if we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after any such event, each holder of a right would then be entitled to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, shares of the acquiring company's common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the right.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2014, we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. we believe that the policies set forth below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.
revenue recognition we generate nearly all of our revenue from sales of our omnipod insulin management system and other diabetes related products including blood glucose testing supplies, insulin pumps, pump supplies and pharmaceuticals to customers and third-party distributors who resell the products to patients with diabetes.
revenue recognition requires that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, delivery of goods occurs through transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. with respect to these criteria:
•   the evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a physician order form, a patient information form and, if applicable, third-party insurance approval for sales directly to patients or a purchase order for sales to a third-party distributor.
•   transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership are passed to the patient or third-party distributor upon shipment of the products.
•   the selling prices for all sales are fixed and agreed with the patient or third-party distributor, and if applicable, the patient's third-party insurance provider(s) prior to shipment and are based on established list prices or, in the case of certain third-party insurers, contractually agreed upon prices. provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are established as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded.
we offer a 45-day right of return for our omnipod system sales to new patients, and we defer revenue to reflect estimated sales returns in the same period that the related product sales are recorded. returns are estimated through a comparison of our historical return data to our related sales. historical rates of return are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace when appropriate. when doubt exists about reasonable assuredness of collectibility from specific customers, we defer revenue from sales of products to those customers until payment is received.
in june 2011, we entered into a development agreement with a u.s. based pharmaceutical company (the "development agreement"). under the development agreement, we were required to perform design, development, regulatory, and other services to support the pharmaceutical company as it works to obtain regulatory approval to use our drug delivery technology as a delivery method for its pharmaceutical. over the term of the development agreement, we have invoiced amounts based upon meeting certain defined deliverable milestones. revenue on the development agreement was recognized using a proportional performance methodology based on efforts incurred and total payments under the agreement. the impact of changes in the expected total effort or contract payments were recognized as a change in estimate using the cumulative catch-up method.
we had deferred revenue of $1.6 million as of december 31, 2014. the deferred revenue recorded as of december 31, 2014 was primarily comprised of product-related revenue.
impairment of assets in connection with our efforts to pursue improved gross margins, leverage operational efficiencies and better pursue opportunities for low-cost supplier sourcing, we periodically perform an evaluation of our manufacturing processes and review the carrying value of our property and equipment to assess the recoverability of these assets whenever events indicate that impairment may have occurred. as part of this assessment, we review the planned use of the assets as well as the future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by those assets. if impairment is indicated through this review, the carrying amount of the asset would be reduced to its estimated fair value. this review of manufacturing processes and equipment can result in an impairment of assets based on current net book value and potential future use of the assets.

asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets, including accounts receivable, inventory and fixed assets. we use a variety of factors to assess valuation, depending upon the asset. actual results may differ materially from our estimates. inventories are held at the lower of their cost or market value. we periodically review inventories for potential impairment based on quantities on hand and expectations of future use. property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. leasehold improvements are amortized over their useful life or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter. we review long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. we also review assets under construction to ensure certainty of their future installation and integration into the manufacturing process. an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. impairment, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. we consider various valuation factors, principally planned use of the assets and discounted cash flows, to assess the fair values of long-lived assets.
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. we review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
we follow the provisions of fasb asc 740-10, income taxes ("asc 740-10") on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements. asc 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. in addition, asc 740-10 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. we recognize estimated interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.
we file federal, state and foreign tax returns. these returns are generally open to examination by the relevant tax authorities from three to four years from the date they are filed. the tax filings relating to our federal and state tax returns are currently open to examination for tax years 2011 through 2013 and 2010 through 2013, respectively. in addition, we have generated tax losses since our inception in 2000. these years may be subject to examination if the losses are carried forward and utilized in future years.
income tax expense in the year ended december 31, 2014 was comprised of the following (in thousands):
current                        $61
deferred                        81
total income tax expense      $142
the current portion primarily relates to state and foreign taxes. the deferred portion primarily relates to the u.s. federal and state tax amounts.
stock-based compensation we account for stock-based compensation under the provisions of fasb asc 718-10, compensation -stock compensation ("asc 718-10"). asc 718-10 requires that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. share-based payments that contain performance conditions are recognized when such conditions are probable of being achieved.
48
we use the black-scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted-average fair value of options granted. we determine the intrinsic value of restricted stock and restricted stock units based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. we recognize the compensation expense of share-based awards on a straight-line basis for awards with only services conditions and on an accelerated method for awards with performance conditions. compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the awards.
the determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards utilizing the black-scholes model is affected by the stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. the expected life of the awards is estimated based on the midpoint scenario, which combines historical exercise data with hypothetical exercise data for outstanding options. the risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the awards. the dividend yield assumption is based on company history and the expectation that we will not pay dividends. forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. stock-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest. we evaluate the assumptions used to value the awards on a quarterly basis and if factors change and different assumptions are utilized, stock-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what has been recorded in the past. if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense.
in the year ended december 31, 2014 we recorded $22.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.
fair value measurements we adopted fasb asc 820, fair value measurements and disclosures ("asc 820") related to the fair value measurement of certain of our assets and liabilities. asc 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. a single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and assumptions. when estimating fair value, depending on the nature and complexity of the asset or liability, we may use one or all of the following approaches:
•   market approach, which is based on market prices and other information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.
•   cost approach, which is based on the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets less an allowance for functional and/or economic obsolescence.
•   income approach, which is based on the present value of the future stream of net cash flows.
asc 820 also describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure the fair value:
level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 - observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 3 - unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions the assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurement standards at december 31, 2014 are cash equivalents, consisting of money market funds and long-term debt, which are based on level 1 inputs.
certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due from third-party payors, patients, third-party distributors, and government agencies. the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded at the time the potential collection risk is identified. we estimate our allowance based on historical experience, assessment of specific risk, discussions with individual customers or various assumptions and estimates that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. at december 31, 2014 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $5.8 million. we believe the reserve is adequate to mitigate current collection risk.
49
intangibles and other long-lived assets our finite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. we assess our intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment, whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. we assess the need for an impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable based on its undiscounted future cash flows. any such impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. the estimation of useful lives and expected cash flows requires us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside our control. changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations. the estimated life of the acquired tradename is 15 years. the estimated life of the acquired customer relationships asset is ten years. intangible assets with determinable estimated lives are amortized over these lives. at december 31, 2014 intangible assets related to the acquisition of neighborhood diabetes consisted of $11.9 million of customer relationships and $2.1 million of tradenames.
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquired neighborhood diabetes businesses over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. we follow the provisions of fasb asc 350-20, intangibles - goodwill and other ("asc 350-20"). we perform an assessment of our goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there might be impairment.
we continue to operate in one segment, which is considered to be the sole reporting unit and therefore, goodwill was tested for impairment at the enterprise level. to test for impairment, we have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the sole reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. this qualitative analysis is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment analysis. if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step goodwill impairment test will be performed. the first step, compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis. if the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, we would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. no goodwill impairment was recorded in the year ended december 31, 2014.
warranty we provide a four-year warranty on our pdms and may replace any omnipods that do not function in accordance with product specifications. we estimate our warranty at the time the product is shipped based on historical experience and the estimated cost to service the claims. cost to service the claims reflects the current product cost which has been decreasing over time. as these estimates are based on historical experience, and we continue to introduce new versions of existing products, we also consider the anticipated performance of the product over its warranty period in estimating warranty reserves. at december 31, 2014 the warranty reserve was $2.6 million.
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers ("asu 2014-09"). asu
2014-09 requires that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
under this guidance, a company may make additional estimates regarding performance conditions and the allocation of variable consideration. the guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after january 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 2014-09.
in june 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-12, compensation - stock compensation (topic 718), accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieve after the requisite service period ("asu 2014-12"). asu 2014-12 clarifies the period over which compensation cost would be recognized in awards with a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period.
compensation cost would be recognized over the required service period, if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. the guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after january 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 2014-12.

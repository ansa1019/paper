item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are the nations leading retailer, and a leading distributor, of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states. we began operations in 1979 and at august 30, 2014, operated 4,984 stores in the united states, including puerto rico; 402 stores in mexico; and five stores in brazil. each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products. at august 30, 2014, in 3,845 of our domestic stores, we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations and public sector accounts. we also have commercial programs in select stores in mexico and brazil. we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through www.alldata.com. additionally, we sell automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products through www.autozone.com, and accessories and performance parts through www.autoanything.com, and our commercial customers can make purchases through www.autozonepro.com. we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services.
executive summary we achieved strong performance in fiscal 2014, delivering record net income of $1.070 billion, a 5.2% increase over the prior year, and sales growth of $327.8 million, a 3.6% increase over the prior year. we completed the year with growth in all areas of our business. we are pleased with the results of our retail business and the increase in our commercial business, where we continue to build our internal sales force and refine our parts assortment. over the past several years, various factors have occurred within the economy that affects both our consumer and our industry, including continued high unemployment, and other challenging economic conditions. although new vehicle sales have increased over previous years, we believe our consumers cash flows continue to be challenged due to these factors. given the nature of these macroeconomic factors, we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends will continue, nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future. we continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macro environment.
another macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry is gas prices. during fiscal 2014, the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the united states was $3.48 per gallon, compared to $3.65 per gallon during fiscal 2013. with approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the u.s., each $1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately $11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month. we continue to believe gas prices have an impact on our customers abilities to maintain their vehicles, allowing us to communicate through our marketing messages the steps needed to improve their gas mileage. given the unpredictability of gas prices, we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease, nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods.
during fiscal 2014, failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix, at approximately 84% of total sales, with failure related categories continuing to be our strongest performers. we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years.
20
our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message, store staffing, and product quantities and assortment. specifically, during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014, we have closely studied our hub distribution model and store inventory levels and assortment. as a result, we are performing certain strategic tests including adding additional inventory into our hub stores, increasing product availability, and delivering to stores more frequently.
the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the long-term are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road.
miles driven we believe that as the number of miles driven increases, consumers vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance, resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items. while over the long-term we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven, we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven. during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven, we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors, including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. since the beginning of the fiscal year and through june 2014 (latest publicly available information), miles driven increased slightly compared to the same period last year.
seven year old or older vehicles between 2008 and 2012, new vehicle sales were significantly lower than historical levels, which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12,500 miles each year. in seven years, the average miles driven equates to approximately 87,500 miles. our experience is that at this point in a vehicles life, most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating. according to the latest data provided by the auto care association, as of january 1, 2014, the average age of vehicles on the road is 11.4 years as compared to 11.3 years as of january 1, 2013. although the average age of vehicles continues to increase, it is increasing at a decelerated rate primarily driven by the improvement in new car sales in recent years. however, in the near term, we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy. as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases, we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell.
results of operations fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013
for the fiscal year ended august 30, 2014, we reported net sales of $9.475 billion compared with $9.148 billion for the year ended august 31, 2013, a 3.6% increase from fiscal 2013. this growth was driven primarily by domestic same store sales increase of 2.8% and net sales of $165.9 million comprised of sales from new stores and increased commercial programs. excluding the 53rd week last year, sales increased 5.6%.
at august 30, 2014, we operated 4,984 domestic stores, 402 stores in mexico and five stores in brazil, compared with 4,836 domestic stores, 362 stores in mexico and three in brazil at august 31, 2013. we reported a total auto parts (domestic, mexico, and brazil) sales increase of 3.1% for fiscal 2014. excluding the 53rd week last year, total auto parts sales increased 5.1%.
gross profit for fiscal 2014 was $4.935 billion, or 52.1% of net sales, compared with $4.741 billion, or 51.8% of net sales for fiscal 2013. the improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs and lower shrink expense, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives (17 basis points).
operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 increased to $3.105 billion, or 32.8% of net sales, from $2.968 billion, or 32.4% of net sales for fiscal 2013. the increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was primarily due to higher store payroll (11 basis points) and planned information system investments (10 basis points).
21
interest expense, net for fiscal 2014 was $167.5 million compared with $185.4 million during fiscal 2013. this decrease was primarily due to a decline in borrowing rates, partially offset by higher borrowing levels over the comparable year period. average borrowings for fiscal 2014 were $4.274 billion, compared with $3.927 billion for fiscal 2013 and weighted average borrowing rates were 3.6% for fiscal 2014, compared to 4.5% for fiscal 2013.
our effective income tax rate was 35.7% of pre-tax income for fiscal 2014 compared to 36.0% for fiscal 2013.
net income for fiscal 2014 increased by 5.2% to $1.070 billion, and diluted earnings per share increased 13.6% to $31.57 from $27.79 in fiscal 2013. the impact of the fiscal 2014 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014 was an increase of approximately $1.04.
fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012
for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2013, we reported net sales of $9.148 billion compared with $8.604 billion for the year ended august 25, 2012, a 6.3% increase from fiscal 2012. this growth was driven primarily by sales from new stores of $222.3 million, the 53rd week sales of $177.7 million, and sales from autoanything for a portion of the fiscal year.
at august 31, 2013, we operated 4,836 domestic stores, 362 stores in mexico and three stores in brazil, compared with 4,685 domestic stores, 321 stores in mexico and none in brazil at august 25, 2012. we reported a total auto parts (domestic, mexico, and brazil operations) sales increase of 5.2% for fiscal 2013.
gross profit for fiscal 2013 was $4.741 billion, or 51.8% of net sales, compared with $4.432 billion, or 51.5% of net sales for fiscal 2012. the improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by lower product acquisition costs, partially offset by the inclusion of autoanything (28 basis points).
operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2013 increased to $2.968 billion, or 32.4% of net sales, from $2.803 billion, or 32.6% of net sales for fiscal 2012. operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, improved due to lower incentive compensation (19 basis points), partially offset by lower sales growth rates.
interest expense, net for fiscal 2013 was $185.4 million compared with $175.9 million during fiscal 2012. this increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period; partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates. average borrowings for fiscal 2013 were $3.927 billion, compared with $3.507 billion for fiscal 2012 and weighted average borrowing rates were 4.5% for fiscal 2013, compared to 4.7% for fiscal 2012.
our effective income tax rate was 36.0% of pre-tax income for fiscal 2013 compared to 36.0% for fiscal 2012.
net income for fiscal 2013 increased by 9.3% to $1.016 billion, and diluted earnings per share increased 18.3% to $27.79 from $23.48 in fiscal 2012. the impact of the fiscal 2013 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was an increase of approximately $1.09.
in december 2012, we acquired certain assets and liabilities of autoanything, an online retailer of specialized automotive products for $116 million. with the acquisition, we expect to bolster our online presence in the automotive accessory and performance markets. the results of operations from autoanything have been included in our other business activities since the date of acquisition.
we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 for the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the acquisition of autoanything. based on an analysis of autoanythings revised planned financial results compared to the initial projections, we determined it was more likely than not the goodwill attributed to autoanything was impaired. accordingly, we performed a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. because the fair value of the reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $18.3 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. based on our evaluation of the future discounted cash flows of autoanythings trade name as compared to its carrying value, it was determined that autoanythings trade name was also impaired. we recorded an impairment charge of $4.1 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 related to the trade name.
22
based on the revised plan financial results, we also determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration. therefore, we adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration at august 31, 2013 to $0.2 million, resulting in a decrease to the contingent consideration liability of $23.3 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. the net impact of the impairment charges and the contingent consideration adjustment is a gain of $0.9 million for fiscal 2013. the net impact is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in our other business activities.
seasonality and quarterly periods our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september, in which average weekly per-store sales historically have been about 15% to 25% higher than in the slower months of december and january. during short periods of time, a stores sales can be affected by weather conditions. extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail; thereby increasing sales of seasonal products. mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales, as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather, with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather. over the longer term, the effects of weather balance out, as we have stores throughout the united states, puerto rico, mexico and brazil.
each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2014, 17 weeks in 2013, and 16 weeks in 2012. because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks, compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income. the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 represented 32.2% of annual sales and 34.9% of net income; the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 represented 33.8% of annual sales and 36.5% of net income; and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 represented 32.1% of annual sales and 34.8% of net income. liquidity and capital resources the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and products. net cash provided by operating activities was $1.341 billion in fiscal 2014, $1.415 billion in fiscal 2013, and $1.224 billion in fiscal 2012. cash flows from operations are unfavorable to last year due to the change in inventories net of payables, partially offset by the growth in net income. we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 114.9% at august 30, 2014, 115.6% at august 31, 2013, and 111.4% at august 25, 2012. our inventory increases are primarily attributable to our efforts to update product assortments in all of our stores and an increased number of stores. during fiscal 2013 and 2014, we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability, which increased our inventory per store. many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms. these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio.
our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued new-store development program. from the beginning of fiscal 2012 to august 30, 2014, we have opened 580 new stores. net cash flows used in investing activities were $448.0 million in fiscal 2014, compared to $527.3 million in fiscal 2013, and $374.8 million in fiscal 2012. we invested $438.1 million in capital assets in fiscal 2014, compared to $414.5 million in fiscal 2013, and $378.1 million in fiscal 2012. the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of stores opened and increased investment in our existing stores. new store openings were 190 for fiscal 2014, 197 for fiscal 2013, and 193 for fiscal 2012. cash flows used for purchasing intangibles were $11.1 million for fiscal 2014. cash flows used in the acquisition of autoanything were $116.1 million during fiscal 2013. there were no purchases of intangibles or acquisitions in fiscal 2012. we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities. we purchased $49.7 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2014, $44.5 million in fiscal 2013, and $45.7 million in fiscal 2012. we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $46.8 million in fiscal 2014, $37.9 million in fiscal 2013, and $42.4 million in fiscal 2012. capital asset disposals provided proceeds of $4.2 million in fiscal 2014, $9.8 million in fiscal 2013, and $6.6 million in fiscal 2012.
23
net cash used in financing activities was $911.6 million in fiscal 2014, $847.0 million in fiscal 2013, and $843.4 million in fiscal 2012. the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled $1.099 billion for fiscal 2014, $1.387 billion for fiscal 2013, and $1.363 billion for fiscal 2012. the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations, and by increases in debt levels. proceeds from issuance of debt were $400 million for fiscal 2014, $800 million for fiscal 2013, and $500 million for fiscal 2012. in fiscal 2014, the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of the $500 million senior notes due in january 2014. we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the remainder of the $500 million senior notes due in january 2014. in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes, including for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, store openings and stock repurchases. proceeds from the issuance of debt in fiscal 2013 were also used for the acquisition of autoanything. in fiscal 2013, we repaid our $200 million senior notes due in june 2013 and our $300 million senior notes due in october 2012 using commercial paper borrowings. there were no repayments of debt in fiscal 2012. in 2014, we received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and short-term borrowings in the amount of $256.8 million. in 2013, net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and short-term borrowings were $118.7 million. in 2012, net payments of commercial paper and short-term borrowings were $81.3 million.
subsequent to august 30, 2014, we purchased interamerican motor corporation (imc), the second largest distributor of oe quality import replacement parts in the united states, for approximately $80 million. imc specializes in parts coverage for european and asian cars, and it currently operates 17 branches. the transaction closed on september 27, 2014, and was financed with commercial paper borrowings.
during fiscal 2015, we expect to invest in our business at an increased rate as compared to fiscal 2014. our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our new-store development program, enhancements to existing stores and supply chain infrastructure, and the acquisition of imc. the amount of our investments in our new-store program is impacted by different factors, including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased (requiring higher investment) or leased (generally lower investment), located in the united states, mexico or brazil, or located in urban or rural areas. during fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013, and fiscal 2012, our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 6%, 10% and 18%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. our mix of store openings has moved away from build-to-suit leases (lower initial capital investment) to ground leases and land purchases (higher initial capital investment), resulting in increased capital expenditures per store over the previous three years, and we expect this trend to continue during the fiscal year ending august 29, 2015.
in addition to the building and land costs, our new-store development program requires working capital, predominantly for inventories. historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases; however, our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors capacity to factor their receivables from us. certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us, allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate.
depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. the balance may be funded through new borrowings. we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past.
our cash balances are held in various locations around the world. as of august 30, 2014, and august 31, 2013, cash and cash equivalents of $19.3 million and $38.2 million, respectively, were held outside of the u.s. and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations. we intend to continue to permanently reinvest the cash held outside of the u.s. in our foreign operations.
for the fiscal year ended august 30, 2014, our after-tax return on invested capital (roic) was 31.9% as compared to 32.7% for the comparable prior year period. roic is calculated as after-tax operating profit
24
(excluding rent charges) divided by average invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases). the decrease in roic is primarily due to the increase in average debt. we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance.
debt facilities in december 2013, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility, increasing the capacity under the revolving credit facility to $1.25 billion. this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings, letters of credit and other short-term, unsecured bank loans. the capacity of the credit facility may be increased to $1.5 billion prior to the maturity date at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval, may include up to $200 million in letters of credit, and may include up to $175 million in capital leases each fiscal year. under the revolving credit facility, we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans or base rate loans. interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate, defined as the london interbank offered rate (libor) plus the applicable percentage, as defined in the revolving credit facility, depending upon our senior, unsecured, (non-credit enhanced) long-term debt rating. interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the revolving credit facility. we also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility. the revolving credit facility expires in september 2017.
the revolving credit facility agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2.50:1. this ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and rents to (ii) consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents. our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 30, 2014 was 4.95:1.
as of august 30, 2014, $893.8 million of commercial paper borrowings and $319.1 million of the 5.750% senior notes due january 2015 are classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance on a long-term basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facility. as of august 30, 2014, we had $1.213 billion of availability under our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, expiring in september 2017 that would allow us to replace these short-term obligations with long-term financing.
in addition to the revolving credit facility, we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of $100 million. as of august 30, 2014, we have $100.0 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility, which expires in june 2016.
in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above, we had $31.4 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 30, 2014. these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis.
on january 14, 2014, we issued $400 million in 1.300% notes due january 2017 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 17, 2012 (the shelf registration). the shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital, capital expenditures, new store openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. proceeds from the debt issuance on january 14, 2014, were used to repay a portion of the $500 million in 6.500% senior notes due january 2014. we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the remainder of the 6.500% senior notes.
on april 29, 2013, the company issued $500 million in 3.125% senior notes due july 2023 under its shelf registration. proceeds from the debt issuance on april 29, 2013, were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings, which were used to repay the $200 million in 4.375% senior notes due june 2013, and for general corporate purposes.
on november 13, 2012, we issued $300 million in 2.875% senior notes due january 2023 under the shelf registration. proceeds from the debt issuance on november 13, 2012, were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings, which were used to repay the $300 million in 5.875% senior notes due in october 2012, and for general corporate purposes.
25
the 5.750% senior notes issued in july 2009 and the 7.125% senior notes issued during august 2008 (collectively, the notes), are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded. further, all senior notes issued since august 2008 contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control (as defined in the agreements). our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens. under our revolving credit facility, covenants include limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions on liens, a maximum debt to earnings ratio, and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances. these covenants are in addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above. all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs.
as of august 30, 2014, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future.
for the fiscal year ended august 30, 2014, our adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense (ebitdar) ratio was 2.5:1 as compared to 2.5:1 as of the comparable prior year end. we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt, capital lease obligations and rent times six; and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense to net income. we target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings. we believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels.
stock repurchases during 1998, we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors (the board). on june 17, 2014, the board voted to increase the authorization by $750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from $14.15 billion to $14.9 billion. from january 1998 to august 30, 2014, we have repurchased a total of 136.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $14.031 billion. we repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.099 billion during fiscal 2014, 3.5 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.387 billion during fiscal 2013, and 3.8 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.363 billion during fiscal 2012. considering cumulative repurchases as of august 30, 2014, we have $869.2 million remaining under the board of directors authorization to repurchase our common stock.
subsequent to august 30, 2014, we have repurchased 374,601 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $190.9 million.

(1)   debt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest.

(2)   represents obligations for interest payments on long-term debt.

(3)   operating lease obligations are inclusive of amounts accrued within deferred rent and closed store obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.

(4)   capital lease obligations include related interest.

(5)   self-insurance reserves reflect estimates based on actuarial calculations. although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments are predictable based upon historical patterns.
accordingly, we reflect the net present value of these obligations in our consolidated balance sheets.

we have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account. during fiscal 2014, we made contributions of $16.9 million to the pension plan. we expect to make contributions of approximately $2.6 million during fiscal 2015; however a change to the expected cash funding may be impacted by a change in interest rates or a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets.
as of august 30, 2014, our defined benefit obligation associated with our pension plans is $301.0 million and our pension assets are valued at $243.4 million, resulting in a net pension obligation of $57.6 million. amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are $104.8 million at august 30, 2014. the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into pension expense in the future, unless the losses are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains.
additionally, our tax liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, was $33.5 million at august 30, 2014. approximately $514 thousand is classified as current liabilities and $33.0 million is classified as long-term liabilities. we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions.
off-balance sheet arrangements the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 30, 2014:
(in thousands)                       total other commitments standby letters of credit         $135,944
surety bonds                        28,118
$164,062
a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers. there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. the standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year, but have automatic renewal clauses.

reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures
selected financial data and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). these non-gaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders value.
non-gaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. however, we have presented the non-gaap financial measures, as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative year-to-year operating results. furthermore, our management and compensation committee of the board use the above-mentioned non-gaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performance-based compensation. we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables.

critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board. the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management:
inventory reserves and cost of sales lifo we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (lifo) method for domestic merchandise and the first-in, first out (fifo) method for mexico and brazil inventories. due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases, our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the fifo method. we do not write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments, and due to price deflation, lifo costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by $307.2 million at august 30, 2014, calculated using the dollar value method.

inventory obsolescence and shrinkage our inventory, primarily hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products, is used on vehicles that have rather long lives; and therefore, the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit. in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs, we record a charge (less than $2 million in each of the last three years) through cost of sales for the difference. these charges are based on managements judgment, including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods.
historically, we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory, nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates. however, we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns.
additionally, we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage, which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories. shrinkage may occur due to theft, loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods, among other things. throughout the year, we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates. we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results. over the last three years, there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate.
each quarter, we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results. to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates, we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements. historically, we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use.
a 10% difference in our inventory reserves as of august 30, 2014, would have affected net income by approximately $6.3 million in fiscal 2014.
vendor allowances we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including allowances for warranties, advertising and general promotion of vendor products. vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory, unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendors products. approximately 85% of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold.
based on our vendor agreements, a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases. therefore, we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory. during the year, we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations. we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them. historically, we have had write-offs less than $150 thousand in each of the last three years.
goodwill and intangibles we evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values exceed the current fair values. we evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors, such as macroeconomic, industry, market, or any other factors that could impact the reporting units fair value. if these factors indicate impairment, we perform a quantitative assessment to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and involves valuation methods including forecasting future financial performance, estimates of discount rates, and other factors. if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss.
indefinite-lived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset
31
exceeds the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss. these impairment analyses require a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual results may be different from our estimates.
the carrying value of goodwill at august 30, 2014 and august 31, 2013 was $367.8 million. during fiscal fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an $18.3 million goodwill impairment charge in our other business activities related to the goodwill of autoanything and a $4.1 million impairment charge to autoanythings trade name. the $4.1 million impairment charge resulted in a remaining carrying value of $24.6 million at august 31, 2013. we also determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration. therefore, these impairment charges were offset by an adjustment of $23.3 million to the contingent consideration liability to reflect its fair value at august 31, 2013. no impairment charges were recognized in our other business activities in previous fiscal years. no impairment charges were recognized in the auto parts stores reporting segment during fiscal 2014 or in previous fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to evaluate goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles.
self-insurance reserves we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation, employee health, general and products liability, property and vehicle liability; and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks. our self-insurance reserve estimates totaled $195.1 million at august 30, 2014, and $190.2 million at august 31, 2013. this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations, including inflation, increases in health care costs, the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked, as well as our historical claims experience and changes in our discount rate.
the assumptions made by management in estimating our self-insurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience, judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels. we utilize various methods, including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods, to estimate the cost to settle reported claims, and claims incurred but not yet reported. the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. when estimating these liabilities, we consider factors, such as the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal costs associated with claims, healthcare trends, and projected inflation of related factors. in recent history, our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent, and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates. as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred, we will adjust our reserves accordingly.
management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self- insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. arriving at these estimates, however, requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates. for example, changes in our assumptions about health care costs, the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness, the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates, causing our reserves to be overstated or understated. for instance, a 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net income by approximately $12.6 million for fiscal 2014.
our liabilities for workers compensation, certain general and product liability, property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities; however, the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities. accordingly, we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be long-term using the risk-free interest rate as of the balance sheet date. if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points, net income would have been affected by approximately $2.0 million for fiscal 2014. our liability for health benefits is classified as current, as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks.
income taxes our income tax returns are audited by state, federal and foreign tax authorities, and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time. tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing
32
interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate. the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits, changes in tax laws, litigation, appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions. we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded. as of august 30, 2014, we had approximately $33.5 million reserved for uncertain tax positions.
we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years; however, actual results could differ from our estimates, and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. specifically, management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions. additionally, to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or must pay in excess of recognized reserves, our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected.
pension obligation prior to january 1, 2003, substantially all full-time employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan. the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employees highest consecutive five-year average compensation. on january 1, 2003, the plan was frozen. accordingly, pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. on january 1, 2003, our supplemental, unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen. accordingly, plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. as the plan benefits are frozen, the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels, but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances:
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets: for the fiscal year ended august 30, 2014, we have assumed a 7.5% long-term rate of return on our plan assets. this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio, our historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions. we review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis, and revise it accordingly. additionally, we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our long-term strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets. in august 2014, our investment committee approved a revised asset allocation target for the investments held by the pension plan. based on the revised asset allocation target, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets changed from 7.5% for the year ended august 30, 2014, to 7.0% for the year ending august 29, 2015. at august 30, 2014, our plan assets totaled $243.4 million in our qualified plan. our assets are generally valued using the net asset values, which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. we have no assets in our nonqualified plan. a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately $1.2 million for the qualified plan.
discount rate used to determine benefit obligations: this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term, high-quality, corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year. for fiscal 2014, we assumed a discount rate of 4.3%. a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense. a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 30, 2014 would impact annual pension expense/income by approximately $2.0 million for the qualified plan and $30 thousand for the nonqualified plan.

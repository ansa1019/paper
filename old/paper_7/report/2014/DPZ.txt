item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
overview our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks, comprised of three twelve-week quarters and one sixteen-week quarter. every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra (or 53rd) week in the fourth quarter. fiscal 2012, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014 each consisted of 52 weeks.
description of the business dominos is the second largest pizza restaurant chain in the world, with more than 11,600 locations in over 75 markets. founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. although we are a highly-recognized global brand, we focus on serving the local neighborhoods in which we live and do business through our large network of franchise owners and company-owned stores. on average, we sell more than 1.5 million pizzas each day throughout our global system.
our business model is straightforward: we handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, which are enhanced by our technology innovations. our dough is generally made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees.
dominos generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties to its franchisees. royalties are ongoing percent-of-sales fees for use of the dominos brand marks. the company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the u.s. and canada, and by operating a number of our own stores. franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. in our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the dominos pizza® brand to master franchisees. these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they profit by sub-franchising and selling ingredients and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores. everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can feed their family dominos menu items conveniently and economically.
our business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and company-owned stores. it can also yield significant cash flow to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks since becoming a publicly-traded company.
in the fourth quarter of 2014 several organizational changes were made within the companys management structure, with one of the changes impacting the management of our supply chain operations. as a result, management determined that our previous domestic supply chain segment and the international supply chain operations division of our previous international segment should be combined into a new global supply chain segment. as a result, we now report the following three business segments: domestic stores, supply chain and international franchise. while the consolidated results of the company have not been impacted by this change in our reportable segments, we have restated our historical segment information in order to provide readers of our financial statements with a consistent presentation.
fiscal 2014 highlights
   global retail sales (which are total retail sales at company-owned and franchised stores worldwide) increased 11.1% as compared to 2013.

   same store sales increased 7.5% in our domestic stores and, when excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, increased 6.9% in our international stores.

   our revenues increased 10.6%.

   our income from operations increased 10.1%.

   our net income increased 13.7%.

during 2014, we continued our rapid global expansion with the opening of 743 net new stores. our international segment led the way with a record 662 net new store openings.
we continued our focus on growing online ordering and the digital customer experience as we introduced dom, a voice ordering application, which we believe is the first in the restaurant industry, and we also made the dominos tracker® available on the pebble smartwatch platform. our emphasis on technology innovation helped us generate approximately 45% of u.s. sales from digital channels in 2014, as well as reach an estimated $3.6 billion in global digital sales.
overall, we believe our focus in 2014 on global growth and technology will strengthen our brand in the future.

fiscal 2013 highlights
   global retail sales increased 8.2% as compared to 2012.

   same store sales increased 5.4% in our domestic stores and, when excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, increased 6.2% in our international stores.

   our revenues increased 7.4%.

   our income from operations increased 11.2%.

   our net income increased 27.2%.

during 2013, we continued our strong global growth, as evidenced by the 631 net new stores that were opened. our international segment led the way with 573 net new store openings.
we also remained focused on technology and improving the experience for our customers. we launched our enhanced online ordering profiles platform, allowing customers the ability to reorder their favorite order in as few as five clicks, or about 30 seconds. our emphasis on technology innovation helped us generate approximately 40% of u.s. sales from digital channels in 2013, as well as reach an estimated $3 billion in global digital sales.
we believe our accomplishments and efforts in each of these areas will improve our brand image and brand positioning in the future.
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, our management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, long-lived and intangible assets, insurance and legal matters, share-based payments and income taxes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from those estimates. changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period. we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are:
revenue recognition. we earn revenues through our network of domestic company-owned and franchised stores, dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations. retail sales from franchise stores are reported to the company by its franchisees and are not included in company revenues. retail sales from company-owned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchised stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers. retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to the company based on a percentage of retail sales, as specified in the related standard franchise agreement (generally 5.5% of domestic franchise retail sales and, on average, 3.1% of international franchise retail sales). revenues from company-owned stores and royalty revenues from franchised stores can fluctuate from time-to-time as a result of store count changes. this can occur when a company-owned store is sold to a franchisee. if a company-owned store that generated $500,000 in revenue in fiscal 2013 was sold to a franchisee in fiscal 2014, revenues from company-owned stores would have declined by $500,000 in fiscal 2014, while franchise royalty revenues would have increased by only $27,500 in fiscal 2014, as we generally collect 5.5% of a domestic franchisees retail sales. sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees, while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees.
long-lived and intangible assets. we record long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and capitalized software, at cost. for acquisitions of franchise operations, we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets, historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition. we depreciate and amortize long-lived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us. we evaluate the potential impairment of long-lived assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. our evaluation is based on various analyses, including the projection of undiscounted cash flows. for company-owned stores, we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis, which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows. if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset, the company estimates the fair value of the asset. if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
25
we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of company-owned stores during the years presented. same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets. if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs, the carrying value of our company-owned stores, by market, may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge. as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the company incurred an impairment charge related to its corporate airplane in the fourth quarter of 2014. aside from this impairment charge, the company did not record an impairment charge during fiscal 2014.
a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment, specifically, our company-owned stores division. we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit (which is primarily determined using the present value of historical cash flows) to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, goodwill would be impaired. we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment during the years presented. at december 28, 2014, the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value, including the related goodwill. if cash flows generated by our company-owned stores were to decline significantly in the future or there were negative revisions to the market multiple assumption, we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge. however, based on the latest impairment analysis, we do not believe it is reasonably likely that there could be changes in assumptions that would trigger impairment.
insurance and legal matters. we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters. these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves, legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict. accordingly, if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason, we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods. we had accruals for legal matters of approximately $4.3 million at december 28, 2014 and $5.0 million at december 29, 2013.
for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001, we maintain insurance coverage for workers compensation, general liability and owned and non-owned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between $500,000 and $3.0 million, depending on the policy year and line of coverage. the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates, which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events. specifically, various methods, including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods, are utilized to estimate the cost to settle reported claims, and claims incurred but not yet reported. the actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. when estimating these liabilities, several factors are considered, including the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal cost associated with claims, healthcare trends and projected inflation.
our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented. management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self-insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves, changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods. a 10% change in our self-insurance liability at december 28, 2014 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately $4.1 million for fiscal 2014. we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately $41.4 million at december 28, 2014 and $38.8 million at december 29, 2013.
share-based payments. we recognize compensation expense related to our share-based compensation arrangements over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. the grant date fair value of each restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock award is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant. the grant date fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a black-scholes option pricing model. the pricing model requires assumptions, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life, which significantly impact the assumed fair value. we are also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest. we use historical data to determine these assumptions. additionally, our stock option, restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock arrangements provide for accelerated vesting and the ability to exercise during the remainder of the ten-year stock option life upon the retirement of individuals holding the awards who have achieved specified service and age requirements.
26
management believes that the methods and various assumptions used to determine compensation expense related to these arrangements are reasonable, but if the assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years.
income taxes. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions. we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, related reserves and deferred tax assets and liabilities. these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets, if necessary. on an ongoing basis, management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. the company had valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets of approximately $0.5 million as of december 28, 2014 and approximately $0.9 million as of december 29, 2013. our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, based on our estimates and assumptions. changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
the amounts recorded on the balance sheet relating to uncertain tax positions consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions. we believe we have appropriately accounted for our uncertain tax positions; however, tax audits, changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes. we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or due to the passage of time. the completion of a tax audit, the expiration of a statute of limitations, or changes in penalty and interest reserves associated with uncertain tax positions are examples of situations when we may adjust our reserves. management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters. however, to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts, we may be required to adjust our tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods.

revenues. revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our company-owned stores, royalties and fees from our domestic and international franchised stores and sales of food, equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our domestic franchised stores and certain international franchised stores. company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. supply chain revenues may vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell.
consolidated revenues increased $191.6 million or 10.6% in 2014. the increase was driven by higher supply chain revenues due to higher volumes from increased store order counts, higher commodity prices, and increased sales of equipment to stores in connection with our store reimaging program. domestic store revenues rose due to an increase in same store sales and store count growth. in addition, higher international franchise same store sales and store count growth also increased consolidated revenues. these increases were offset in part by the negative impact on international revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. these changes in revenues are more fully described below.
domestic stores. revenues from domestic stores are primarily comprised of retail sales from domestic company-owned store operations as well as royalties from retail sales and other fees from domestic franchised stores, as summarized in the following table.

domestic company-owned stores          $348.5            60.2   %         $337.4            61.4   %
domestic franchise                      230.2            39.8   %          212.4            38.6   %
total domestic stores revenues         $578.7           100.0   %         $549.8           100.0   %
higher franchise same store sales, store count growth and higher domestic company-owned same store sales drove an increase in overall domestic store revenues of $28.9 million or 5.3%. these results are more fully described below.
domestic company-owned stores. revenues from domestic company-owned store operations increased $11.1 million or 3.3% in 2014. this increase was due to a 6.2% increase in same store sales as compared to 2013, offset in part by a decrease in the average number of domestic company-owned stores open during 2014.
domestic franchise. revenues from domestic franchise operations increased $17.8 million or 8.4% in 2014. the increase was driven by a 7.7% increase in same store sales as compared to 2013 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average number of domestic franchised stores open during 2014. revenues further benefited from fees paid by franchisees related to our insourced online ordering platform and we also incurred an increase in expenses related to these technology initiatives.
28
supply chain. revenues from supply chain operations are primarily comprised of sales of food, equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our domestic franchised stores and certain international franchised stores, as summarized in the following table.
2014                                 2013
domestic supply chain              $1,141.1            90.4   %         $1,009.9            90.3   %
international supply chain            121.4             9.6   %            109.0             9.7   %
total supply chain                 $1,262.5           100.0   %         $1,118.9           100.0   %
domestic supply chain. domestic supply chain revenues increased $131.2 million or 13.0% in 2014. the increase was primarily attributable to higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level, higher overall commodity prices, and increases in sales of equipment and supplies. changes in u.s. cheese prices increased revenues by approximately $33.0 million in 2014.
international supply chain. revenues from international supply chain operations increased $12.4 million or 11.3% in 2014. this increase resulted primarily from higher volumes in 2014, and was offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $7.3 million during the year.
international franchise. international franchise revenues primarily consist of royalties from retail sales and other fees from our international franchise stores. revenues from international franchise operations increased $19.0 million or 14.3% in 2014. this increase was due to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2014, and was offset in part by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $3.4 million in 2014. excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, same store sales increased 6.9% in 2014 compared to 2013. when the impact of foreign currency exchange rates is included, same store sales increased 4.9% in 2014 compared to 2013. this variance was caused by a generally stronger u.s. dollar when compared to the currencies in the international markets in which we compete.
cost of sales / operating margin. consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of domestic company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor and occupancy costs. the changes to the consolidated operating margin, which we define as revenues less cost of sales are summarized in the following table.
2014                                    2013
consolidated revenues                    $1,993.8           100.0   %            $1,802.2           100.0   %
consolidated cost of sales                1,399.1            70.2   %             1,253.2            69.5   %
consolidated operating margin              $594.8            29.8   %              $549.0            30.5   %
the $45.8 million or 8.3% increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to higher domestic and international franchise revenues and higher supply chain margins. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin.
as a percentage of total revenues, our consolidated operating margin decreased 0.7 percentage points in 2014, due to lower supply chain and company-owned stores operating margins as a percentage of their revenues. these changes were primarily a result of higher commodity prices and were offset in part by a higher mix of franchise revenues and are more fully described below.
domestic company-owned stores. the changes to domestic company-owned store operating margin, which do not include other store-level costs such as royalties and advertising, are summarized in the following table.
2014                               2013
revenues                       $348.5           100.0   %         $337.4           100.0   %
cost of sales                   267.4            76.7   %          256.6            76.0   %
store operating margin          $81.1            23.3   %          $80.8            24.0   %
the $0.3 million or 0.4% increase in the domestic company-owned store operating margin was due primarily to higher same store sales. this was offset in part by an increase in overall commodity prices and labor and related expenses.
as a percentage of store revenues, the store operating margin decreased 0.7 percentage points in 2014, as discussed in more detail below.
   food costs increased 0.7 percentage points to 28.3% in 2014, due primarily to higher overall commodity prices. the cheese block price per pound averaged $2.13 in 2014 compared to $1.75 in 2013.

   occupancy costs, which include rent, telephone, utilities and depreciation, decreased 0.1 percentage points to 9.2% in 2014 due primarily to the positive impact of higher sales per store.

   labor and related costs remained flat at 28.0% in 2014.

   insurance costs decreased 0.1 percentage points to 2.7% in 2014, due primarily to the positive impact of higher sales per store.

29
supply chain. the changes to the supply chain operating margin are summarized in the following table.
2014                                    2013
revenues                                 $1,262.5           100.0   %         $1,118.9           100.0   %
cost of sales                             1,131.7            89.6   %            996.7            89.1   %
supply chain operating margin              $130.8            10.4   %           $122.2            10.9   %
the $8.6 million increase in the supply chain operating margin was due primarily to higher volumes from increased store order counts.
as a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin decreased 0.5 percentage points in 2014 due to higher commodity prices and higher health insurance costs, offset in part by the positive impact of higher volumes. increases in certain food prices have a negative effect on the supply chain operating margin percentage due to the fixed dollar margin earned by supply chain on certain food items. changes in u.s. cheese prices increased both revenues and costs by $33.0 million in 2014. if the 2014 u.s. cheese prices had been in effect during 2013, the supply chain operating margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues would have decreased by 0.3 percentage points. however, the dollar margin would have been unaffected.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased $14.2 million or 6.1% in 2014. these increases were due in part to an impairment charge of $5.8 million in connection with replacing our corporate airplane, as well as continued investments that we made in technology and international initiatives, including the addition of team members in both areas. a decrease in non-cash compensation expense of $4.4 million partially offset these increases.
interest income. interest income decreased slightly to $0.1 million in 2014.
interest expense. interest expense decreased $2.0 million to $86.9 million in 2014. the decrease was due primarily to lower interest expense resulting from a lower average debt balance during 2014 compared to 2013 and to a lesser extent, lower interest expense from the cash collateralization of our letters of credit.
our cash borrowing rate remained flat at 5.3% during fiscal 2014. our average outstanding debt balance, excluding capital lease obligations, was approximately $1.52 billion in 2014 and approximately $1.54 billion in 2013. the decrease in the companys average outstanding debt balance resulted from the principal payments made on its fixed rate notes during the first two quarters of 2014.
provision for income taxes. provision for income taxes increased $13.9 million to $96.0 million in 2014, due primarily to higher pre-tax income. the companys effective income tax rate increased 0.6 percentage points to 37.1% of pre-tax income in 2014. the lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2013 primarily resulted from a tax benefit recorded for prior tax years in connection with the company revising its calculation for a deduction related to its domestic dough production.
2013 compared to 2012
(tabular amounts in millions, except percentages)
revenues. consolidated revenues increased $123.8 million or 7.4% in 2013. the increase was driven by higher supply chain revenues due to a change in the mix of products sold, higher volumes from increased store order counts and higher commodity prices. higher international same store sales and store count growth also increased consolidated revenues. domestic franchise and company-owned store revenues also rose due to an increase in same store sales. these increases were offset in part by the negative impact on international revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. these changes in revenues are more fully described below.
domestic stores. domestic stores revenues are summarized in the following table.
2013                               2012
domestic company-owned stores          $337.4            61.4   %         $323.7            62.4   %
domestic franchise                      212.4            38.6   %          195.0            37.6   %
total domestic stores revenues         $549.8           100.0   %         $518.7           100.0   %
higher franchise same store sales and higher domestic company-owned same store sales drove an increase in royalty revenues, which increased overall domestic store revenues by $31.1 million or 6.0%. these results are more fully described below.
domestic company-owned stores. revenues from domestic company-owned store operations increased $13.8 million or 4.3% in 2013. the increase was primarily due to a 3.9% increase in same store sales as compared to 2012.
30
domestic franchise. revenues from domestic franchise operations increased $17.4 million or 8.9% in 2013. the increase was driven by a 5.5% increase in same store sales as compared to 2012 and to a lesser extent, an increase in the average number of domestic franchised stores open during 2013. revenues further benefited from fees paid by franchisees related to our insourced online ordering platform and we also incurred an increase in expenses related to these technology initiatives. additionally, we contracted with a third party to manage our gift card program during 2013. in connection with this change, we refined our assessment of our gift card liability and recorded approximately $3.2 million of domestic franchise revenue and reimbursed approximately $1.5 million to our national advertising fund, as discussed further in general and administrative expenses.
supply chain. supply chain revenues are summarized in the following table.
2013                                 2012
domestic supply chain              $1,009.9            90.3   %           $942.2            90.6   %
international supply chain            109.0             9.7   %             97.6             9.4   %
total supply chain                 $1,118.9           100.0   %         $1,039.8           100.0   %
domestic supply chain. domestic supply chain revenues increased $67.7 million or 7.2% in 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level, higher overall commodity prices, a change in the mix of products sold and increases in sales of equipment and supplies. changes in u.s. cheese prices increased revenues by approximately $8.6 million in 2013.
international supply chain. revenues from international supply chain operations increased $11.4 million or 11.7% in 2013. the increase resulted primarily from higher volumes during the year, and was offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $2.9 million in 2013.
international franchise. international franchise revenues increased $13.6 million or 11.3% in 2013. the increase was primarily driven by higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2013, offset in part by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.3 million in 2013. excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, same store sales increased 6.2% in 2013 compared to 2012. when the impact of foreign currency exchange rates is included, same store sales increased 2.8% in 2013 compared to 2012. this variance was caused by a generally stronger u.s. dollar when compared to the currencies in the international markets in which we compete.
cost of sales / operating margin. the changes to the consolidated operating margin, which we define as revenues less cost of sales, are summarized in the following table.
2013                                    2012
consolidated revenues                    $1,802.2           100.0   %            $1,678.4           100.0   %
consolidated cost of sales                1,253.2            69.5   %             1,177.1            70.1   %
consolidated operating margin              $549.0            30.5   %              $501.3            29.9   %
the $47.7 million or 9.5% increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to higher domestic and international franchise revenues, higher margins at our company-owned stores and higher domestic supply chain margins. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin.
as a percentage of total revenues, our consolidated operating margin increased 0.6 percentage points in 2013, due to a higher mix of franchise revenues and higher supply chain and company-owned stores operating margins, offset in part by higher overall commodity prices.
domestic company-owned stores. the changes to domestic company-owned store operating margin, which do not include other store-level costs such as royalties and advertising, are summarized in the following table.
2013                               2012
revenues                       $337.4           100.0   %         $323.7           100.0   %
cost of sales                   256.6            76.0   %          247.4            76.4   %
store operating margin          $80.8            24.0   %          $76.3            23.6   %
the $4.5 million or 6.0% increase in the domestic company-owned store operating margin was the result of higher same store sales, lower labor and related expenses, lower occupancy expenses and lower insurance expenses. this was offset in part by an increase in overall commodity prices.
31
as a percentage of store revenues, the store operating margin increased 0.4 percentage points in 2013, as discussed in more detail below.
   food costs increased 0.5 percentage points to 27.6% in 2013, due primarily to higher overall commodity prices. the cheese block price per pound averaged $1.75 in 2013 compared to $1.69 in 2012.

   occupancy costs, which include rent, telephone, utilities and depreciation, decreased 0.2 percentage points to 9.3% in 2013 due primarily to the positive impact of higher sales per store.

   labor and related costs decreased 0.4 percentage points to 28.0% in 2013, due primarily to leveraging the higher sales per store.

   insurance costs decreased 0.3 percentage points to 2.8% in 2013, due primarily to lower health costs per store and the positive impact of higher sales per store.

supply chain. the changes to the supply chain operating margin are summarized in the following table.
2013                                 2012
revenues                              $1,118.9           100.0   %         $1,039.8           100.0   %
cost of sales                            996.7            89.1   %            929.7            89.4   %
supply chain operating margin           $122.2            10.9   %           $110.1            10.6   %
the supply chain operating margin increased $12.1 million or 11.0% in 2013 due primarily to higher volumes from increased store order counts and a change in the mix of products sold.
as a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin increased 0.3 percentage points in 2013 due to the positive impact of higher volumes and lower health insurance costs, offset in part by higher commodity costs. increases in certain food prices have a negative effect on the supply chain operating margin percentage due to the fixed dollar margin earned by supply chain on certain food items. changes in u.s. cheese prices increased both revenues and costs by $8.6 million in 2013. if the 2013 u.s. cheese prices had been in effect during 2012, the supply chain operating margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues would have decreased by 0.1 percentage points. however, the dollar margin would have been unaffected.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased $16.2 million or 7.4% in 2013. these increases were due in part to an increase in non-cash compensation expense of $4.4 million and higher variable performance-based compensation expenses of approximately $2.0 million. general and administrative expenses also include a reimbursement of approximately $1.5 million during 2013 to our national advertising fund related to their historical costs to support the companys gift card program, as discussed above in domestic franchise revenues. additionally, we continued our investments in technology and international initiatives, including the addition of team members in both areas, which also increased general and administrative expenses during 2013 compared to 2012.
interest income. interest income decreased slightly to $0.2 million in 2013.
interest expense. interest expense decreased $12.6 million to $88.9 million in 2013. the decrease was driven by approximately $10.2 million of expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2012 related to the 2012 recapitalization which did not recur in 2013, as well as from lower interest expense resulting from a lower average debt balance during 2013 compared to 2012.
our cash borrowing rate decreased slightly, by 0.2 percentage points, to 5.3% during fiscal 2013. our average outstanding debt balance, excluding capital lease obligations, was approximately $1.5 billion in 2013 and approximately $1.6 billion in 2012. the decrease in the companys average outstanding debt balance resulted from the principal payments made on its fixed rate notes during 2013.
provision for income taxes. provision for income taxes increased $13.3 million in 2013, due primarily to higher pre-tax income. the companys 2013 effective income tax rate decreased 1.5 percentage points to 36.5% of pre-tax income. this decrease was partly from a tax benefit of approximately $1.4 million recorded in the third quarter of 2013 related to prior tax years in connection with the company revising its calculation for a deduction related to its domestic dough production.
32
liquidity and capital resources historically, we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities. we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale, and we generally experience 30 to 40 inventory turns per year. in addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits our working capital requirements. these factors, coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, invest in our business, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock, reduce our working capital amounts. as of december 28, 2014, we had working capital of $41.8 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $121.0 million and including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $30.9 million.
as of december 28, 2014, we had approximately $56.2 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments, $43.9 million of cash held as collateral for outstanding letters of credit, $20.8 million of restricted cash held in a three month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.1 million of other restricted cash, for a total of $121.0 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents.
the company entered into a recapitalization transaction in 2012, in which certain of our subsidiaries replaced the outstanding 2007 fixed rate notes and variable funding notes with new notes (the notes) issued pursuant to an asset-backed securitization. the notes consist of $1.575 billion of series 2012-1 5.216% fixed rate senior secured notes, class a-2 (the fixed rate notes) and $100.0 million of series 2012-1 variable funding senior secured notes, class a-1 (the variable funding notes). additional information related to the recapitalization transaction is included in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
the fixed rate notes original scheduled principal amortization payments are $29.5 million in 2015, $37.4 million in 2016, $39.4 million in each of 2017 and 2018, and $9.8 million in 2019. in accordance with our debt agreements, once we meet certain conditions, including maximum leverage ratios as defined of less than or equal to 4.5x total debt to ebitda, we cease to make the scheduled principal amortization payments. if one of the defined leverage ratios subsequently exceeds 4.5x, we must make-up the payments we had previously not made. during the second quarter of 2014, we met the maximum leverage ratios of less than 4.5x, and, in accordance with our debt agreements, ceased debt amortization payments in the third quarter of 2014. we continued to meet the maximum leverage ratios of less than 4.5x in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and currently do not plan to make previously scheduled debt amortization payments as permitted in our debt agreements.
the notes are subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a debt service coverage calculation, as defined in the related agreements. in the event that certain covenants are not met, the notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule.
on march 16, 2012, our board of directors declared a $3.00 per share special cash dividend on the outstanding common stock totaling $171.1 million, which was paid on april 2, 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 26, 2012. additionally, under the anti-dilution provisions in our underlying stock option plans, on april 2, 2012, we made a corresponding cash payment of approximately $13.5 million on certain stock options, reduced the exercise price on certain other stock options by an equivalent per share amount and, in certain circumstances, both reduced the stock option exercise price and made a cash payment totaling $3.00 per share.
on april 2, 2012, we also accrued an estimated $2.4 million for payments to be made as certain performance-based restricted stock grants vest. the dividend and related dividend equivalent payments were funded with the remaining proceeds from the 2012 recapitalization and cash on hand. these anti-dilution payments were accounted for as modifications/settlements and were recorded as increases in total stockholders deficit. as of december 30, 2012, total cash paid for common stock dividends and related anti-dilution equivalent payments was approximately $185.5 million and the total estimated liability recorded for future cash dividend payments on certain performance-based restricted stock was approximately $1.5 million. as of december 28, 2014, the total estimated liability recorded for future cash dividend payments on certain performance-based restricted stock was approximately $0.6 million.
during fiscal 2012, in connection with the 2012 recapitalization, we incurred approximately $10.5 million of net expenses. additionally, we recorded an additional $32.5 million of deferred financing costs as an asset in the consolidated balance sheet during fiscal 2012. this amount, in addition to the $7.4 million recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at january 1, 2012 is being amortized into interest expense over the seven-year expected term of the debt.

our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes. as of december 28, 2014, we had $44.1 million of outstanding letters of credit and $55.9 million of available borrowing capacity under our variable funding notes. the letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and supply chain center leases. the company has collateralized these letters of credit with $43.9 million of restricted cash to reduce its fees on the variable funding notes, and has the ability to access this cash with minimal notice. borrowings under the variable funding notes are available to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and, subject to other limitations, other general corporate purposes including dividend payments.
the company has a board of directors-approved open market share repurchase program of the companys common stock, which was reset during the first quarter of 2014 at $200.0 million. the open market share repurchase program has historically been funded by excess cash flows. the company used cash of approximately $82.4 million in 2014 and $97.1 million in 2013 for share repurchases. the company had approximately $132.7 million left under the $200.0 million authorization as of december 28, 2014. we expect to continue to use ongoing excess cash flow generation and (subject to certain restrictions in the documents governing the variable funding notes) availability under the variable funding notes to, among other things, repurchase shares under the current authorized program.
in the past three years, we have invested between $29.3 million and $71.8 million annually in capital expenditures. in 2014, we invested $71.8 million in capital expenditures which primarily related to investments in existing company-owned stores, supply chain centers and training facilities, the purchase of a corporate airplane, investments in our proprietary internally developed point-of-sale system (dominos pulse), our digital ordering platform and other technology initiatives. we expect to continue capital expenditures of $50 to $60 million in the future as we see continuing opportunities to invest in our industry leading technology platform, the reimaging of our corporate stores and other initiatives to grow our brand. we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december 28, 2014.
the following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows:

operating activities cash provided by operating activities was $192.3 million in fiscal 2014. our cash provided by operating activities was mainly the result of net income of $162.6 million that was generated during the year, which included non-cash expenses of $29.7 million.
during fiscal 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $194.0 million, mainly the result of net income of $143.0 generated during fiscal 2013 and which included non-cash expenses of $39.5 million. the changes in operating assets and liabilities also generated $11.5 million of cash inflows during 2013.
cash provided by operating activities was $176.3 million in fiscal 2012. our cash provided by operating activities was mainly the result of net income of $112.4 million that was generated during the year and which included $43.8 million of non-cash expenses. the changes in operating assets and liabilities also generated $20.1 million of cash inflows, primarily from the timing of payments of operating liabilities.
we are focused on continually improving our net income and cash flow from operations, and management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future.
investing activities during fiscal 2014, cash used in investing activities was $57.4 million, which consisted primarily of $70.1 million of capital expenditures (driven by increased investments in company-owned stores and supply chain centers, investments in our technology initiatives, and the purchase of a corporate airplane). proceeds from the sale of assets of $9.2 million and a $4.5 million net change in restricted cash offset the use of cash in investing activities.
34
during fiscal 2013, cash used in investing activities was $99.7 million, which consisted primarily of a $65.4 million net change in restricted cash and cash equivalents and $40.4 million of capital expenditures, offset by $4.5 million of proceeds from the sale of assets.
cash provided by investing activities was $7.3 million in fiscal 2012. the main drivers of this change were the net change in restricted cash that provided $32.6 million of cash, and the use of cash through $29.3 million of capital expenditures.
financing activities we used $118.9 million of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2014 compared to $134.8 million during fiscal 2013, both primarily related to purchases of common stock, funding dividend payments to our shareholders and making payments on our long-term debt obligations. the tax impact of equity-based compensation offset the use of cash in financing activities in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013.
in fiscal 2012, we used $177.4 million of cash in financing activities. during fiscal 2012 we issued $1.6 billion of debt in connection with our 2012 recapitalization, which was more than offset by the $1.5 billion repayment of our existing debt at that time, the payment of $185.5 million of special dividend payments to our shareholders, $88.2 million purchases of common stock, and $32.5 million of cash paid for financing costs related to our 2012 recapitalization.
during fiscal 2014, we experienced increases in both domestic and international same store sales and our international business continued to grow stores. these factors have contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. we expect to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, our restricted cash amounts pledged as collateral for letters of credit, ongoing cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock. based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe that the cash generated from operations, our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under the variable funding notes will be more than adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements, capital expenditures, dividend payments and working capital needs for the foreseeable future.
our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a. risk factors. there can be no assurance, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance the fixed rate notes and to service, extend or refinance the variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate. inflation did not have a material impact on our operations in 2014, 2013 or 2012. severe increases in inflation, however, could affect the global and u.s. economies and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. further discussion on the impact of commodities and other cost pressures is included above as well as in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
new accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. this guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance issued by the fasb, including industry specific guidance. the guidance is effective for the company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on january 1, 2017, and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. early adoption is prohibited. the company is evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
accounting standards that have been issued by the fasb or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

contractual obligations the following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at december 28, 2014.
(dollars in millions)   2015          2016          2017          2018          2019              thereafter            total long-term debt (1):
principal                        $            $            $            $          $1,521.8   $                 $1,521.8
interest (2)                   79.4          79.4          79.4          79.4              19.8                        337.4
capital leases (3)              0.7           0.7           0.7           0.5                                           2.6
operating leases (4)           38.6          36.3          32.4          28.7              22.3   45.7                  204.0
(1)   the maturity date of the long-term debt noted within the table above reflects the companys expected repayment date of january 2019, rather than the legal maturity date of january 2042.

(2)   the interest rate on our variable funding notes is based primarily on a current commercial paper rate plus 350 basis points. the interest rate on the fixed rate notes is fixed at 5.216% per year.

(3)   the principal portion of the capital lease obligation amounts above, which totaled $2.3 million at december 28, 2014, are classified as debt in our consolidated financial statements.

(4)   we lease certain retail store and supply chain center locations, supply chain vehicles, various equipment and our world resource center, which is our corporate headquarters, under leases with expiration dates through 2024.

liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $2.9 million are excluded from the above table, as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.
off-balance sheet arrangements we are party to letters of credit and, to a lesser extent, financial guarantees with off-balance sheet risk. our exposure to credit loss for letters of credit and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amounts of these instruments. total conditional commitments under letters of credit as of december 28, 2014 were approximately $44.1 million and relate to our insurance programs and supply chain center leases. the company has guaranteed lease payments related to certain franchisees lease arrangements. the maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees is $2.2 million as of december 28, 2014. we believe that none of these arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

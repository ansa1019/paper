results by reporting segment the company's business is comprised of two reporting segments: engine and drivetrain. these segments are strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems.
the company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after-tax return on invested capital ("roic") of its business initiatives. roic is comprised of adjusted ebit after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required. adjusted ebit is comprised of earnings before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest ("ebit") adjusted for restructuring, goodwill impairment charges, affiliates' earnings and other items not reflective of ongoing operating income or loss.
adjusted ebit is the measure of segment income or loss used by the company. the company believes adjusted ebit is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments.
the following tables show segment information and adjusted ebit for the company's reporting segments.

outlook our overall outlook for 2015 is positive. the company expects strong net new business-related sales growth in 2015 due to rapid adoption of borgwarner products around the world, partially offset by a stronger u.s. dollar, which would reduce the u.s. dollar value of its foreign currency-denominated sales.

balance sheet debt increased by $117.4 million and cash decreased by $141.7 million compared with december 31, 2013. the $259.1 million increase in balance sheet debt (net of cash) was primarily due to the february 28, 2014 acquisition of wahler, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $801.8 million, $718.8 million and $878.7 million in the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily reflects higher net earnings adjusted for non-cash charges to operations. the decrease for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared with the year ended december 31, 2012 primarily reflects working capital changes partially offset by higher net earnings. the change in working capital is primarily driven by the $137.5 million discretionary pension contribution made to the company's german pension plans and an increased accounts receivable balance.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $665.1 million, $384.8 million and $345.2 million in the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013 is primarily driven by the acquisition of wahler and higher capital expenditures including tooling outlays. the increase in the year ended december 31, 2013 compared with the year ended december 31, 2012 is primarily driven by cash received in the third quarter of 2012 from the sale of the company's spark plug business. year over year capital spending increases of $145.2 million and $10.4 million during the years ended december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively, were primarily due to higher spending levels required to meet increased program launches worldwide.

financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $201.7 million, $135.4 million and $188.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the $66.3 million increase in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013 is primarily driven by lower net borrowings in 2014 and higher dividends paid to borgwarner stockholders, partially offset by higher payments for the purchase of treasury stock in 2013. the $53.2 million decrease in the year ended december 31, 2013 compared with the year ended december 31, 2012 is primarily driven by an increase in net borrowings and decreased payments for treasury stock purchases, partially offset by increased payments for dividends and a reduction in proceeds from stock option exercises, including the tax benefit.

we believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash balances, available credit facilities, and the universal shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future. we will continue to balance our needs for internal growth, external growth, debt reduction and cash conservation.
off balance sheet arrangements the company has certain leases that are recorded as operating leases. types of operating leases include leases on facilities, an airplane, vehicles and certain office equipment. the total expected future cash outlays for non-cancelable operating lease obligations at december 31, 2014 is $69.6 million. refer to note 16, "leases and commitments," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information on operating leases, including future minimum payments.

pension and other postretirement employee benefits the company's policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate. at december 31, 2014, all legal funding requirements had been met. the company contributed $53.4 million, $150.4 million and $18.0 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the company expects to contribute a total of $15 million to $25 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2015. of the $15 million to $25 million in projected 2015 contributions, $9.9 million are contractually obligated, while any remaining payments would be discretionary.
the funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of $172.8 million and $157.2 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. of these amounts, $76.5 million and $68.6 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were related to plans in germany, where there is not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans; hence the common practice is to make contributions as benefit payments become due. in december 2014 and 2013, the company made discretionary contributions of $30.2 million and $137.5 million, respectively to its german pension plans.
other postretirement employee benefits primarily consist of postretirement health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the company's u.s. operations. the company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. other postretirement employee benefits had an unfunded status of $169.7 million and $177.5 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future.
refer to note 11, "retirement benefit plans," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits.
other matters contingencies in the normal course of business, the company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. the company's environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. the company's management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter.
litigation in january 2006, borgwarner diversified transmission products inc. ("dtp"), a subsidiary of the company, filed a declaratory judgment action in united states district court, southern district of indiana (indianapolis division) against the united automobile, aerospace, and agricultural implements workers of america ("uaw") local no. 287 and gerald poor, individually and as the representative of a defendant class. dtp sought the court's affirmation that dtp did not violate the labor-management relations act or the employee retirement income security act (erisa) by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective april 1, 2006 and october 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the then-current collective bargaining agreements. on september 10, 2008, the court found that dtp's reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained

health insurance agreement with the uaw, which did not expire until april 24, 2009. thus, the amendments were untimely. in 2008, the company recorded a charge of $4.0 million as a result of the court's decision.
dtp filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court, southern district of indiana (indianapolis division) against the uaw local no. 287 and jim barrett and others, individually and as representatives of a defendant class, on february 26, 2009 again seeking the court's affirmation that dtp did not violate the labor - management relations act or erisa by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other company retiree benefit plans after april 24, 2009. certain retirees, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a mirror-image action in the united states district court, eastern district of michigan (southern division) on march 11, 2009, for which a class has been certified. during the last quarter of 2009, the action pending in indiana was dismissed, while the action in michigan is continuing. the company is vigorously defending against the suit.  this contingency is subject to many uncertainties, therefore based on the information available to date, the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss, if any.
environmental the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties ("prps") at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act ("superfund") and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at 27 such sites. responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula.
the company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.
based on information available to the company (which in most cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among prps; the probability that other prps, many of whom are large, solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available information from prps and/or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs; and remediation alternatives), the company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities of $6.2 million and $4.0 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years.
in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation ("kuhlman electric"), the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the company, relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that pre-date the company's 1999 acquisition of kuhlman electric. the company previously settled or obtained dismissals of various lawsuits that were filed against kuhlman electric and others, including the company, on behalf of plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination at its crystal springs, mississippi plant. the company filed a lawsuit against kuhlman electric and a related entity challenging the validity of the indemnity and the defendants filed counterclaims and a related lawsuit. in addition, two lawsuits by plaintiffs alleging environmental contamination relating to kuhlman electric's crystal springs plant are still pending and the company may in the future become subject to further legal proceedings.
38
product liability like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the u.s., the company (or parties the company is obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions. we believe that the company's involvement is limited because, in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos. the nature of the fibers, the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the company had approximately 13,300 and 17,000 pending asbestos-related product liability claims, respectively. the decrease in the pending claims is a result of legislation passed in 2013 in texas where claims against the company have been dismissed.
the company's policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment. the company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos-related product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers. in 2014, of the approximately 6,500 claims resolved, 397 (6%) resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company. in the full year of 2013, of the approximately 1,500 claims resolved, 297 (20%) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company.
prior to june 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the company's primary layer insurance carriers under a series of funding arrangements. in addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos-related claims, the company has excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestos-related product claims. in june 2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits.
a declaratory judgment action was filed in january 2004 in the circuit court of cook county, illinois by continental casualty company and related companies against the company and certain of its historical general liability insurers. the court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing. the company has entered into settlement agreements with some of its insurance carriers, resolving their coverage disputes by agreeing to pay specified amounts to the company. this includes a settlement in cash and short- and long-term notes with a carrier in the fourth quarter of 2014. the company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers.
in august 2013, the los angeles superior court entered a jury verdict against the company in an asbestos-related personal injury action with damages of $35.0 million, $32.5 million of which was non-compensatory and will not be recoverable through insurance if the verdict is upheld. the company has appealed the verdict. the company posted a surety bond of $55.0 million related to the appeal. the company cannot predict the outcome of this pending litigation and therefore cannot reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss, if any, that could result from this action.
the company's estimate of asbestos-related liabilities is subject to uncertainty because liabilities are influenced by numerous variables that are inherently difficult to predict. key variables include the number and type of new claims, the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, reforms that may be made by state and federal courts and the passage of state or federal tort reform legislation. the nature of the historical product being encapsulated and the lifecycle of the product allow the company to aggressively defend against these lawsuits and, at present, management does not believe that asbestos-related product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
to date, the company has paid and accrued $337.8 million in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers' reimbursement and has received $195.9 million in cash and notes from insurers. the net balance of $141.9 million, is expected to be fully recovered. timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of
39
the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements. at december 31, 2013, insurers owed $153.6 million in association with these claims.
in addition to the $141.9 million net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs, the company has estimated a liability of  $111.8 million for claims asserted, but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at december 31, 2014. the company also has a related asset of $111.8 million to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers, which is expected to be fully recovered. receipt of these proceeds is not expected prior to the resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above, which is expected to occur subsequent to december 31, 2015. at december 31, 2013, the comparable value of the accrued liability and associated insurance asset was $96.7 million.
the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows:
december 31,
(millions of dollars)                            2014              2013
assets:
other non-current assets                   $111.8             $96.7
total insurance assets                     $111.8             $96.7
liabilities:
accounts payable and accrued expenses       $47.4             $41.1
other non-current liabilities                64.4              55.6
total accrued liabilities                  $111.8             $96.7
the 2014 increase in the accrued liability and associated insurance asset is primarily due to an expected higher rate of claim settlement based on recent claim activity.
the company does not believe that it can, at present, reasonably estimate possible losses in excess of those for which it has accrued. the company's belief is based on a number of factors, including without limitation, because the company cannot reasonably predict how many additional claims may be brought against the company (or parties the company has an obligation to indemnify) in the future, the particular illnesses or medical conditions that may be alleged in such claims, the allegations in such claims and the evidence submitted by claimants in support thereof, the possible outcomes in settling or litigating such claims, the time in which claims will proceed through courts in which they are asserted, or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels. the company reviews factors relevant to the asbestos claims that have been or may in the future be asserted against it on an ongoing basis.
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"). in preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. our most critical accounting policies are discussed below.
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes, as well as, the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during
40
the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ from those estimates.
concentration of risk the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its suppliers and customers and, with the exception of certain financing transactions, does not require collateral from its oem customers. some automotive parts suppliers continue to experience commodity cost pressures and the effects of industry overcapacity. these factors have increased pressure on the industry's supply base, as suppliers cope with higher commodity costs, lower production volumes and other challenges. the company receives certain of its raw materials from sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers. the inability of a supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the company could affect future operating results.
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is usually upon shipment of product. although the company may enter into long-term supply agreements with its major customers, each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements.
cost of sales the company includes materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales. manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials, indirect labor, factory operating costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale.
impairment of long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other amortizing intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review under accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 360. in assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. in assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent. a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event. if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis. management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost approach. if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations. long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include: (i) an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review; (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset; and (iii) fair valuation of the asset.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year, the company qualitatively assesses its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets assigned to each of its reporting units. this qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances, such as macro economic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting unit's fair value. using this qualitative assessment, the company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value. if it is determined that it is not more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds the carrying value, or upon a triggering event, including recent acquisition or divestiture activity, the company performs a quantitative, "step one," goodwill impairment analysis.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, the company performed a qualitative analysis on each reporting unit, except for reporting units with recent restructuring and acquisition activities, and determined it was more-
41
likely-than-not the fair value exceeded the carrying value of these reporting units. for the reporting units with recent restructuring and acquisition activities, the company performed a quantitative, "step one," goodwill impairment analysis, which requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. the basis of these goodwill impairment analyses is the company's annual budget and long-range plan ("lrp"). the annual budget and lrp includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance. because the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. further, the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the company's facts and circumstances.
the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable. different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. the primary assumptions affecting the company's december 31, 2014 goodwill quantitative, "step one," impairment reviews are as follows:
•   discount rate: the company used a 10% weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") as the discount rate for future cash flows. the wacc is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant.
•   operating income margin: the company used historical and expected operating income margins, which may vary based on the projections of the reporting unit being evaluated.
in addition to the above primary assumptions, the company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models:
•   the automotive industry is cyclical and the company's results of operations would be adversely affected by industry downturns.
•   the company is dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments.
•   the company is subject to risks related to international operations.
based on the assumptions outlined above, the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2014 indicated the company's goodwill assigned to these reporting units that were quantitatively assessed was not impaired and contained fair values substantially higher than the reporting units' carrying values. additionally, sensitivity analyses were completed indicating a one percent increase in the discount rate or a one percent decrease in the operating margin assumptions would not result in the carrying values exceeding the fair values of the reporting units quantitatively assessed.
refer to note 6, "goodwill and other intangibles," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding goodwill.
product warranties the company provides warranties on some, but not all, of its products. the warranty terms are typically from one to three years. provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. these estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual. our warranty provision over the last three years, and as a percentage of net sales, has stabilized based on the company's improved quality efforts and has trended as follows:

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change (as a percentage of net sales) in the assumed warranty trend on the company's accrued warranty liability:

25 basis point increase (income)/expense   $20.8               $18.6               $18.0
at december 31, 2014, the total accrued warranty liability was $132.0 million. the accrual is represented as $91.9 million in current liabilities and $40.1 million in non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
refer to note 7, "product warranty," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding product warranties.
other loss accruals and valuation allowances the company has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer claims, workers' compensation claims, litigation and recoverability of assets. establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization. the company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods; however, changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances.
environmental contingencies the company works with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites. the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability. we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range. management's estimate of the loss for environmental liability was $6.2 million at december 31, 2014.
refer to note 14, "contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding environmental accrual.
pension and other postretirement defined benefits the company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees. costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees, retirees and surviving spouses and dependents.
the company's defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715. the determination of the company's obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits, such as retiree health care, is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note 11, "retirement benefit plans," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report. the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap.
43
in accordance with gaap, actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods. the primary assumptions affecting the company's accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31, 2014 are as follows:
•   expected long-term rate of return on plan assets: the expected long-term rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost. the required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. over time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long-term returns. the expected long-term rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs, including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the company's trusts and its asset allocation, as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return, inflation and other variables. the company also considers the impact of active management of the plans' invested assets. in determining its pension expense for the year ended december 31, 2014, the company used long-term rates of return on plan assets ranging from 1.50% to 6.75% outside of the u.s. and 6.75% in the u.s.
actual returns on u.s. pension assets were 10.3%, 8.3% and 11.0% for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.75% for the same years ended.
actual returns on u.k. pension assets were 16.5%, 12.8% and 10.0% for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.75% for the same years ended.
actual return on german pension assets was 14.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.0% for the same year ended.
•   discount rate: the discount rate is used to calculate pension and postretirement employee benefit obligations ("opeb"). the discount rate assumption is based on a constant effective yield from matching projected plan cash flows to high quality (aa) bond yields of corresponding maturities as of the measurement date. the company used discount rates ranging from 1.25% to 8.00% to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of december 31, 2014, including weighted average discount rates of 3.75% in the u.s., 2.84% outside of the u.s., and 3.50% for u.s. other postretirement health care plans. the u.s. discount rate reflects the fact that our u.s. pension plan has been closed for new participants since 1989 (1999 for our u.s. health care plan).
•   health care cost trend: for postretirement employee health care plan accounting, the company reviews external data and company specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions. in determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of december 31, 2014, the company used health care cost trend rates of 7.50%, declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5% by the year 2022.
while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company's pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense.

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans on its 2015 pre-tax pension expense:

________________
* a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the company's u.s. 2015 pre-tax pension expense.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company's u.s. opeb interest expense:
(millions of dollars)                            impact on 2015 pre-tax opeb interest (expense)/income one percentage point decrease in discount rate   $(0.4                                   )
one percentage point increase in discount rate   $0.4
the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company's total 2015 u.s. opeb expense is expected to be negligible, as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the company's opeb obligation and service and interest cost:

income taxes  the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
management judgment is required in determining the company's provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company's net deferred tax assets. in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the company's valuation allowance may be necessary.
45
the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. at the federal and state level and numerous non-u.s. jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc topic 605. the company's u.s. federal and certain state income tax returns and certain non-u.s. income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities. although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. at december 31, 2014, the company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the more-likely-than-not loss on certain of its tax positions, which is included in other non-current liabilities. nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.

new accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board amended the accounting standards codification to add topic 606, "revenue from contracts with customers," outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and superseding most current revenue recognition guidance. this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. the company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations. some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers. other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward contracts. the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks.
we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk. for quantitative disclosures about market risk, refer to note 10, "financial instruments," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). at december 31, 2014, the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 89.7% of total debt. our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates. a 10% increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pre-tax interest expense of approximately $0.2 million, $1.7 million and $1.6 million in the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. currently, our most significant currency exposures relate to the british pound, the chinese yuan, the euro, the hungarian forint, the japanese yen, the mexican peso, the swedish krona and the south korean won. we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve, by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans. such non-u.s. dollar debt was $129.6 million and $282.3 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. in addition, the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. as of december 31, 2014, the company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of $3.8 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of which $3.7 million in assets and $2.4 million in liabilities mature in less than one year.
commodity price risk commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products. commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various non-ferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components. as of december 31, 2014, the company had no forward and option commodity contracts outstanding.
disclosure regarding forward-looking statements the matters discussed in this item 7 include forward looking statements. see "forward looking statements" at the beginning of this annual report on form 10-k.

report of management on internal control over financial reporting the information in this report is the responsibility of management. borgwarner inc. and consolidated subsidiaries (the "company") has in place reporting guidelines and policies designed to ensure that the statements and other information contained in this report present a fair and accurate financial picture of the company. in fulfilling this management responsibility, we make informed judgments and estimates conforming with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.
the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
the company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america. the internal control process includes those policies and procedures that:
•   pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
•   provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
•   provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. therefore, even those systems determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
the company's management assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014. in making this assessment, the company's management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ("coso") in internal control - integrated framework (2013).
based on management's assessment and those criteria, we believe that, as of december 31, 2014, the company's internal control over financial reporting is effective.
pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the company's consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014 as stated in its report.
the company's audit committee, composed entirely of directors of the company who are not employees, meets periodically with the company's management and independent registered public accounting firm to review financial results and procedures, internal financial controls and internal and external audit plans and recommendations. in carrying out these responsibilities, the audit committee and the independent registered public accounting firm have unrestricted access to each other with or without the presence of management representatives.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
executive summary we are a leading provider of it, consulting and business process services, dedicated to helping the world's leading companies build stronger businesses. our clients engage us to help them build more efficient operations, provide solutions to critical business and technology problems, and help them drive technology-based innovation and growth. our core competencies include: business, process, operations and it consulting, application development and systems integration, eim, application testing, application maintenance, it is, and bps. we tailor our services to specific industries and utilize an integrated global delivery model. this seamless global sourcing model combines client service teams based on-site at the client locations with delivery teams located at dedicated near-shore and offshore global delivery centers.
we completed several acquisitions during 2014 that we believe will accelerate our ability to provide multi-service integrated solutions to the healthcare industry and enhance our overall digital delivery capabilities. we believe that our fourth quarter acquisition of trizetto, the largest acquisition in our history, broadens our solutions offerings and creates an opportunity for us to cross-sell our business process, infrastructure management and consulting services to the trizetto clients where we currently do not have relationships. more importantly, we believe a greater longer term opportunity exists for us to combine trizetto's platforms with our services and program management capabilities to create end-to-end integrated platform-based solutions that bring together infrastructure, applications, the cloud and business process services. during 2014, we completed three other acquisitions to strengthen our digital delivery capabilities across several industry groups.
we closed the acquisition of trizetto on november 20, 2014 for an aggregate purchase price, after giving effect to various purchase price adjustments and net of cash acquired, of approximately $2,627.8 million in cash. in connection with the acquisition, we entered into a credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with a commercial bank syndicate providing for a $1,000.0 million unsecured term loan (the "term loan") and $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the "revolving facility"). we funded the purchase price for the acquisition of trizetto with cash on hand and the $1,000.0 million of proceeds of the term loan.
in 2014, our revenue increased to $10,262.7 million compared to $8,843.2 million in 2013. net income increased to $1,439.3 million or $2.35 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1,228.6 million or $2.02 per diluted share. on a non-gaap basis our 2014 diluted earnings per share increased to $2.601 compared to $2.271 during 2013.
the key drivers of our revenue growth in 2014 were as follows:
•   solid performance across all of our business segments with revenue growth ranging from 12.1% to 20.3%;
•   sustained strength in the north american market where revenues grew 14.9%, inclusive of post-acquisition trizetto revenue of $80.6 million, as compared to 2013;
•   continued penetration of the european and rest of world (primarily the asia pacific) markets where we experienced revenue growth of 19.3% and 23.6%, respectively, as compared to 2013;
•   increased customer spending on discretionary projects;
•   expansion of our service offerings, including consulting, it is, and bps services, which enabled us to cross-sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large-scale outsourcing solutions;
•   increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic clients; and
•   continued expansion of the market for global delivery of it services and bps.

we saw a continued demand from our customers for a broad range of services, including it strategy and business consulting, application development and systems integration, eim, application testing, application maintenance, it is, and bps. in addition, we are seeing increasing customer interest in digital solutions, including our social, mobile, analytics and cloud-based services and increased demand for mobility, data and security services. we are also seeing an increase in demand for larger, more complex projects that are transformational for our customers. such contracts may have longer sales cycles and ramp-up periods and could lead to greater variability in our period-to-period operating results. we increased the number of strategic clients by 28 during the year, bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 271. we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity.
in 2014, our operating margin decreased to approximately 18.4% compared to 19.0% in 2013. our non-gaap operating margin in 2014 was approximately 20.2%2 compared to 20.6%2 in 2013. the decrease in our gaap and non-gaap operating margins was due to increases in compensation and benefit costs (net of the impact of lower incentive-based compensation), subcontractor expense and investments to grow our business, partially offset by the impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee against the u.s. dollar and lower realized losses on our cash flow hedges in 2014 compared to 2013. historically, we have invested our profitability above the 19% to 20% non-gaap operating margin level back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. this investment is primarily focused in the areas of hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise, training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings, strengthening our business analytics and digital technology capabilities, strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services, continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery as well as recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees. in addition, this investment includes maintaining a level of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our targeted operating margin levels back into the business.
we finished the year with approximately 211,500 employees, which is an increase of approximately 40,100 over the prior year and includes approximately 3,770 employees from the acquisition of trizetto. the increase in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs to meet the demand for our services is the primary driver of the increase in our operating expenses in 2014. annualized turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 14.5% for the three months ended december 31, 2014. the majority of our turnover occurs in india. as a result, annualized attrition rates on-site at clients are below our global attrition rate. in addition, attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff. historically, we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive-based compensation costs, in india which may continue in the future; however, historically, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs, the mix of our professional staff as well as utilization levels, and achieving other operating efficiencies.
at december 31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3,774.7 million, working capital of $4,158.2 million and debt outstanding under the credit agreement of approximately $1,637.5 million. the term loan and the revolving facility both mature on november 20, 2019. as of december 31, 2014, we have drawn down $650.0 million under the revolving facility, which is available for general corporate purposes. we believe our cash from operations and capital resources on hand provide sufficient liquidity to continue to make investments to expand and grow our business, and meet our repayment obligations under the credit agreement.
during 2015, barring any unforeseen events, we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results:
•   continued focus by customers on directing it spending towards cost containment projects, such as application maintenance, it is and bps;
•   demand from our customers to help them achieve their dual mandate of simultaneously achieving cost savings while investing in innovation;
•   secular changes driven by evolving technologies and regulatory changes;
•   volatility in foreign currency rates;
•   continued uncertainty in the world economy; and
•   addition of the trizetto business.

in response to this environment, we plan to:
•   continue to invest in our talent base and new service offerings;
•   partner with our existing customers to garner an increased portion of our customers' overall it spend by providing innovative solutions;
•   continue our focus on growing our business in europe, the middle east, the asia pacific and latin america regions, where we believe there are opportunities to gain market share;
•   continue to increase our strategic customer base across all of our business segments;
•   opportunistically look for acquisitions that may improve our overall service delivery capabilities, expand our geographic presence and/or enable us to enter new areas of technology;
•   continue to focus on operating discipline in order to appropriately manage our cost structure;
•   continue to locate most of our new development center facilities in tax incentivized areas; and
•   leverage assets and capabilities obtained from the trizetto acquisition to aggressively pursue new opportunities in the marketplace.
business segments our four reportable business segments are:
•   financial services, which includes customers providing banking/transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services;
•   healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers. our healthcare business segment includes the post-acquisition operating results of trizetto;
•   manufacturing/retail/logistics, which includes consumer goods manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and
•   other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments each of which, individually, represents less than 10.0% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. the other segment includes information, media and entertainment services, communications, and high technology operating customers.
our chief operating decision maker evaluates cognizant's performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. however, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to different degrees. expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development and delivery centers. certain selling, general and administrative expenses, excess or shortfall of incentive compensation for delivery personnel as compared to target, stock-based compensation expense, a portion of depreciation and amortization and the impact of the settlements of our cash flow hedges are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. accordingly, such expenses are excluded from segment operating profit.
we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments. therefore, a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment. however, no individual customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of our consolidated revenues during 2014, 2013 or 2012. in addition, the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and we believe that a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues.

revenue - overall. revenue increased by 16.1% to $10,262.7 million during 2014 as compared to an increase of 20.4% to $8,843.2 million in 2013. in both years, the increase was primarily attributed to greater acceptance of our global delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued interest in using our global delivery model as a means to reduce overall it and operations costs, increased customer spending on discretionary projects, and continued penetration in all our geographic markets. revenue growth in 2014 includes $80.6 million from our november 2014 acquisition of trizetto. revenues from new customers contributed $298.1 million and $243.4 million, representing 21.0% and 16.3% of the year-over-year revenue growth for 2014 and 2013, respectively. in 2014, our consulting and technology services revenues increased by approximately 22.1% and represented approximately 52.8% of total 2014 revenues, while our outsourcing services revenue increased by approximately 10.0% and constituted approximately 47.2% of total revenues. in 2013, consulting and technology services revenue increased by 18.3% and represented approximately 50.2% of total 2013 revenues, while our outsourcing services increased by approximately 22.6% and constituted approximately 49.8% of total 2013 revenues.
revenues from our top five customers as a percentage of total revenues were 12.2%, 13.2% and 14.0% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. revenues from our top ten customers as a percentage of total revenues were 21.3%, 22.6% and 25.0% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. as we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time.

north america continues to be our largest market representing approximately 76.8% of total revenue in 2014 and accounting for $1,019.7 million of the $1,419.5 million revenue increase in 2014. revenue growth among our north america customers includes $80.6 million from our november 20, 2014 acquisition of trizetto. revenue from europe grew 19.3% in 2014 driven by the increasing acceptance of our global delivery model. revenue growth in 2014 for our rest of europe market includes the full-year benefit of our acquisition of equinox consulting, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2013. we believe the european market is under-penetrated and represents a significant future growth opportunity for us. in 2013, revenue in europe grew 32.1%. excluding approximately $93.5 million of revenue from our 2013 acquisitions of the c1 group companies and equinox consulting, revenue from europe grew 24.3% in 2013. the 2013 revenue growth in europe was driven by the strength of europe's economy and the increasing acceptance of our global delivery model. revenue growth from rest of world customers in 2014 was primarily driven by the india, singapore, australia, japan and hong kong markets. in 2013, the revenue growth for rest of world was driven primarily by the middle east, singapore and india markets. we believe that europe, the middle east, the asia pacific and latin america regions will continue to be areas of significant investment for us as we see these regions as growth opportunities for the long term. in 2015, we expect the recent strength of the u.s. dollar to negatively impact our revenue from countries outside the united states, primarily eurozone countries and the u.k.
cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense). our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, payroll taxes, employee benefits, immigration and project-related travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues. our cost of revenues increased by 16.6% or $875.6 million during 2014 as compared to an increase of approximately 23.1% or $987.2 million during 2013. in both 2014 and 2013, the increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits costs. in 2014, compensation and benefit costs increased by approximately $650.6 million as a result of the increase in the number of our technical personnel, partially offset by lower incentive-based compensation costs in 2014 as compared to 2013. in 2013, the increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive-based compensation, was approximately $870.2 million as a result of the increase in the number of our technical personnel and higher accrual of individual bonus payouts as compared to 2012.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, payroll taxes, employee benefits, immigration, travel, marketing, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 17.7% or $336.9 million during 2014 as compared to an increase of approximately 11.3% or $193.1 million during 2013. selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased as a percentage of revenue to 21.8% in 2014 as compared to 21.5% in 2013 and 23.2% in 2012. in 2014, the increase as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefit costs (net of the impact of lower incentive-based compensation costs), professional services, including acquisition-related costs, and investments to grow our business, partially offset by the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the u.s. dollar, and lower realized losses on our cash flow hedges in 2014 compared to 2013.
income from operations and operating margin - overall. income from operations increased 12.3%, or approximately $207.0 million in 2014 as compared to an increase of 23.2% or approximately $316.4 million in 2013. our operating margin decreased to 18.4% of revenues in 2014 from 19.0% of revenues in 2013, due to increases in compensation and benefit costs (net of the impact of lower incentive-based compensation), subcontractor expense, professional fees and investments to grow our business, partially offset by the impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee against the u.s. dollar and lower realized losses on our cash flow hedges in 2014 compared to 2013. in 2013, operating margin increased to 19.0% of revenues from 18.5% of revenues in 2012, due to revenue growth outpacing headcount growth and the impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee against the u.s. dollar, net of losses on our cash flow hedges, partially offset by increases in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive-based compensation costs. excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the
43
depreciation of the indian rupee against the u.s. dollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 86 basis points or 0.86 percentage points in 2014 and 209 basis points or 2.09 percentage points in 2013. each additional 1.0% change in exchange rate between the indian rupee and the u.s. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 20 basis points or 0.20 percentage points.
we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain indian rupee denominated payments in india. these hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the u.s. dollar and the indian rupee. during the years ended december 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012, the settlement of certain cash flow hedges negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately 133 basis points or 1.33 percentage points, 184 basis points or 1.84 percentage points, and 131 basis points or 1.31 percentage points, respectively.
for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, our non-gaap operating margins were 20.2%3, 20.6%3, and 20.2%3, respectively. as set forth in the "non-gaap financial measures" section below, our non-gaap operating margin excludes stock based compensation expense and acquisition-related charges.

the increase in segment operating profit within all reportable segments during 2014 and 2013 was attributable primarily to increased revenues and the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the u.s. dollar in each year, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting primarily from additional headcount to support our revenue growth and continued investments to grow our business. in 2014, the unallocated costs increased when compared to 2013 due to continued investments to grow our business, partially offset by the impact of lower incentive-based compensation accrual rates in 2014.

the foreign currency exchange losses in all the years presented were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of the indian rupee denominated net monetary assets on the books of our indian subsidiaries to the u.s. dollar functional currency as well as the remeasurement of other net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. the (losses) gains on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments relate to the realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts entered into primarily to offset foreign currency exposure to the indian rupee and other non-u.s. dollar denominated net monetary assets. as of december 31, 2014, the notional value of our undesignated hedges was $215.6 million. the increase in interest income in 2014 and 2013 was primarily attributed to the increase in average invested balances. the 2014 increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the interest on the term loan used to fund a portion of our acquisition of trizetto and on amounts drawn down under our revolving facility.
provision for income taxes. the provision for income taxes was $484.8 million in 2014, $459.3 million in 2013 and $336.3 million in 2012. the effective income tax rate decreased to 25.2% in 2014 from 27.2% in 2013 primarily due to changes in the geographical mix of our current year earnings and discrete tax benefits recorded in 2014, partially offset by a scheduled reduction of certain income tax holiday benefits in india in 2014. the effective income tax rate increased to 27.2% in 2013 from 24.2% in 2012, due primarily to a shift in the geographic mix of our 2013 earnings towards countries with higher statutory rates, an increase in the india statutory rate effective april 1, 2013, and a scheduled reduction of certain income tax holiday benefits in india in 2013.
net income. net income increased to approximately $1,439.3 million in 2014 from approximately $1,228.6 million in 2013 and approximately $1,051.3 million in 2012. net income as a percentage of revenues increased slightly to 14.0% in 2014 from 13.9% in 2013. in 2013, net income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 13.9% from 14.3% in 2012 as a result of the increase in the provision of income taxes and an increase in net foreign currency exchange losses, partially offset by the increase in the operating margin.
non-gaap financial measures portions of our disclosure, including the following table, include non-gaap income from operations, non-gaap operating margin, and non-gaap diluted earnings per share. these non-gaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap, and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. in addition, these non-gaap measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap. the reconciliations of cognizant's non-gaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures should be carefully evaluated.
our non-gaap income from operations and non-gaap operating margin exclude stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related charges. in 2014, we modified our definition of non-gaap diluted earnings per share to exclude net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses, in addition to excluding stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related charges. our definition of non-gaap income from operations and non-gaap operating margin remains unchanged.
we seek to manage the company to a targeted non-gaap operating margin of 19% to 20% of revenues. we believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the company provides enhanced transparency into

the operating results of the company. for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use non-gaap financial information that does not include stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges and net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. therefore, it is our belief that the use of non-gaap financial measures excluding these costs provides a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-gaap income from operations, non-gaap operating margin and non-gaap diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported gaap results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
a limitation of using non-gaap financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap is that non-gaap measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with gaap and exclude costs that are recurring, namely stock-based compensation expense, certain acquisition-related charges, and net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses. in addition, other companies may calculate non-gaap financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-gaap financial measures as a comparative tool. we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from non-gaap income from operations, non-gaap operating margin and non-gaap diluted earnings per share to allow investors to evaluate such non-gaap financial measures.
the following table presents a reconciliation of each non-gaap financial measure to the most comparable gaap measure for the years ended december 31:

liquidity and capital resources our cash generated from operations has historically been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to grow our business. in addition, as of december 31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3,774.7 million and additional available capacity under our revolving facility of $100.0 million. in 2014, we funded the acquisition trizetto with $1,800.0 million of cash on hand and $1,000.0 million of proceeds from the term loan. we have used and plan to continue to use a combination of our cash flow from operations, cash on hand and capacity available under our revolving facility for expansion of existing operations, including our offshore development and delivery centers, continued development of new service lines, acquisitions of related businesses, formation of joint ventures, stock repurchases and general corporate purposes, including funding working capital requirements.

the following table provides a summary of the major cash flows and liquidity trends for the three years ended december 31:
(dollars in thousands)                                                                                                                                   increase / decrease

net cash from operating activities                           $1,473,010              $1,423,776              $1,172,583                 $49,234                $251,193
net cash (used in) investing activities                      (3,160,694   )            (730,763   )            (570,046   )          (2,429,931    )           (160,717    )
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities           1,503,410                 (30,867   )            (342,988   )           1,534,277                 312,121
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments             3,774,726               3,747,473               2,863,758                  27,253                 883,715
working capital                                               4,158,203               4,373,374               3,436,964                (215,171    )            936,410
operating activities. the increase in operating cash flow for both 2014 and 2013 was primarily attributed to the increase in net income. the 2013 increase was also due to more efficient deployment of working capital. trade accounts receivable increased to approximately $1,968.7 million at december 31, 2014 as compared to approximately $1,648.8 million at december 31, 2013 and approximately $1,345.7 million at december 31, 2012. unbilled accounts receivable increased to approximately $324.6 million at december 31, 2014 from approximately $226.5 million at december 31, 2013 and $183.1 million at december 31, 2012. the increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable during 2014 was primarily due to increased revenues. we monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, we modified our days sales outstanding calculation to net the uncollected portion of deferred revenue from our total accounts receivable balance. our reported days sales outstanding have historically included trade accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, and unbilled accounts receivable. our new methodology reduces these balances by the uncollected portion of deferred revenue for the purpose of calculating our days sales outstanding. under this modified method, our days sales outstanding as of december 31, 2014 was approximately 70 days as compared to 70 days as of december 31, 2013 and 69 days as of december 31, 2012. under our historical method, our days sales outstanding as of december 31, 2014 was approximately 77 days as compared to 73 days as of december 31, 2013 and 72 days as of december 31, 2012.
investing activities. the increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2014 is primarily related to our payment for the acquisition of trizetto in 2014. in 2013, the increase in net cash used in investing activities, when compared to 2012, was primarily related to higher net investment purchases and payments for acquisitions during 2013 as compared to the 2012 period, partially offset by lower spending for capital expenditures in 2013.
financing activities. the increase in net cash provided by financing activities during 2014 compared to the use of cash in 2013 primarily related to proceeds from borrowings under the 2014 credit agreement. in 2013, the decrease in net cash used in financing activities when compared to 2012, was primarily related to lower levels of repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program in 2013.
on november 20, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with a commercial bank syndicate providing for a $1,000.0 million unsecured term loan and a $750.0 million revolving facility. the term loan was used to pay a portion of the cash consideration in connection with our acquisition of trizetto. the revolving facility is available for general corporate purposes. the term loan and the revolving facility both mature on november 20, 2019. as of december 31, 2014, we have drawn down $650.0 million under the revolving facility.
the credit agreement requires interest to be paid at either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate, plus a margin. the margin over the base rate is 0.00%, and the margin over the eurocurrency rate ranges from 0.75% to 1.125%, depending on our debt ratings (or, if we have not received debt ratings, from 0.875% to 1.00%, depending on our debt to total stockholders' equity ratio). under the credit agreement, we are required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving facility, which vary based on our debt ratings (or, if we have not received debt ratings, our debt to total stockholders' equity ratio). we are required under the credit agreement to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the term loan.
the credit agreement contains certain negative covenants, including limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, subsidiary indebtedness and affiliate transactions, as well as certain affirmative covenants. in addition, the credit agreement requires us to maintain a debt to total stockholders' equity ratio not in excess of 0.40:1.00. as of december 31,
47
2014, we are in compliance with our debt covenants and have provided a quarterly certification to our lenders to that effect. we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the credit agreement to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the remaining available capacity under the revolving facility as of december 31, 2014 and through the date of this filing.
we intend to continue to use a portion of our available capital resources for stock repurchases during 2015. the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, our stock price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of stock repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. stock repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases and through the use of rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. the stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.
we believe our u.s. cash flows continue to be sufficient to fund our current domestic operations and obligations, including debt service. the amount of funds held in u.s. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, including debt repayments, and due to other reasons, such as acquisition-related activities. the company's u.s. operations historically have generated and are expected to continue to generate substantial cash flows. in circumstances where the company has additional cash requirements in the united states, we have several additional liquidity options available to meet those requirements. these options may include borrowing additional funds, including borrowings under our committed revolving facility, temporarily utilizing inter-company loans with certain foreign subsidiaries on a limited basis, and, while we currently do not have plans to do so, repatriating certain of our foreign earnings. we also believe we have access to the credit and equity markets and could borrow additional funds under acceptable terms and conditions or raise additional capital through an equity transaction.
many of our operations are conducted outside the united states and significant portions of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. as of december 31, 2014, $3,433.3 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was held outside the united states. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows and cash balances. we utilize certain strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but, under current law, would be subject to income taxes in the united states, less applicable foreign tax credits. other than amounts for which we have already accrued u.s. taxes, we intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these amounts to fund our liquidity needs in the united states. if such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings at that time. due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation.
we expect our operating cash flow, cash and investment balances, and available capacity under our revolving facility to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months. our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long-term capital requirements beyond a twelve month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate foreign earnings, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. we cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all.
commitments and contingencies as of december 31, 2014, we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately $20.5 million related to our india development center expansion program, which includes expenditures for land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state-of-the-art development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as sezs located in india.

as of december 31, 2014, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments:

___________
(1)   includes scheduled repayments of our term loan.
(2)   interest on the term loan was calculated at interest rates in effect as of december 31, 2014.
(3)   relates to our india development and delivery center expansion program.
(4)   other purchase commitments include, among other things, communications and information technology obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation.
as of december 31, 2014, we had $135.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits. this represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. the resolution of these income tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters.
we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india. as of december 31, 2014, these contracts were in a net unrealized loss position of $102.6 million and have settlement dates in 2015, 2016 and 2017. the actual amounts at which these contracts will be settled may be significantly impacted by fluctuations in the indian rupee to u.s. dollar foreign currency exchange rate prior to settlement. therefore, we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period related to the settlement of these foreign exchange forward contracts.
we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. we accrue a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. in the opinion of management, the outcome of any existing claims and legal or regulatory proceedings, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers' business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. any failure in a customer's systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients, including any breach involving a customer's confidential information or sensitive data, or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover all types of claims, continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed or are not covered by our insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
foreign currency risk overall, we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as approximately 76.8% of our revenues during 2014 were generated from customers located in north america. revenue from our customers in the united kingdom and europe represented 10.7% and 7.6%, respectively, of our 2014 revenues. accordingly,
49
our european operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate of the british pound, euro, swiss franc and other european currencies to the u.s. dollar.
a portion of our costs in india, representing approximately 25.0% of our global operating costs during 2014, are denominated in the indian rupee and are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations. in addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may result in non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement. in 2014, we reported foreign currency exchange losses, exclusive of hedging gains or losses, of approximately $16.5 million, which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of the indian rupee denominated net monetary assets on the books of our india subsidiaries to the u.s. dollar functional currency. on an ongoing basis, we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to certain currencies in our foreign subsidiaries, primarily the indian rupee.
we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india. cognizant india converts u.s. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses. these hedges to buy indian rupees and sell u.s. dollars are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. in 2014, we reported net losses of $136.6 million on contracts that settled during the year. as of december 31, 2014, we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of $2,460.0 million and weighted average contract rate of 64.8 indian rupees to the u.s. dollar. these contracts are scheduled to mature as follows:
notional value (in thousands)           weighted average contract rate (indian rupee to u.s. dollar)
2015              $1,320,000                                              60.8
2016                 720,000                                              68.1
2017                 420,000                                              71.8
total              $2,460,000                                              64.8
our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk for transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets. we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2015 which are used to hedge our foreign currency denominated net monetary assets. at december 31, 2014, the notional value of the outstanding contracts was $215.6 million and the related fair value was an asset of $2.0 million. during 2014, inclusive of losses of $3.9 million on our undesignated balance sheet hedges, we reported net foreign currency exchange losses of approximately $20.4 million.
off-balance sheet arrangements other than our foreign exchange forward contracts, there were no off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2014, 2013 and 2012 that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
effects of inflation our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. in certain regions, competition for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. as with other service providers in our industry, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed-price contracts. historically, we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive-based compensation, in india; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs, mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies. there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future.
critical accounting estimates management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, or u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and
50
intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates. the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed-bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, assumptions used in valuing stock-based compensation arrangements, derivative financial instruments and investments, goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, contingencies and litigation. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
we believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements:
revenue recognition. revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts, which are predominantly fixed-price contracts, are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting. under this method, total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract's total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost (cost to cost method). this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis. revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations. changes in estimates related to our revenue contracts and contract losses were immaterial for the periods presented.
allowance for doubtful accounts. we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit-worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
income taxes. determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets (and related valuation allowance, if any) and liabilities requires significant judgment. we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate. the consolidated provision for income taxes may also change period to period based on non-recurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.
our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of reserves established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related interest, which can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve. although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. to the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. if it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred income tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided. in the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred income tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact recorded to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.
our indian subsidiaries, collectively referred to as cognizant india, are primarily export-oriented companies and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the government of india for export activities conducted within sezs for periods of up to 15 years. our sez income tax holiday benefits are currently scheduled to expire in whole or in part during the years 2016 to 2024 and may be extended on a limited basis for an additional five years per unit if certain reinvestment criteria are met. we have constructed and expect to continue to locate most of our newer development facilities in sezs. our indian profits ineligible for sez benefits are subject to corporate income tax at the current rate of 33.99%. in addition, all
51
indian profits, including those generated within sezs, are subject to the mat, at the current rate of approximately 21.0% including surcharges. any mat paid is creditable against future corporate income tax, subject to limitations. currently, we anticipate utilizing our existing mat balances against our future corporate income tax obligations in india. however, our ability to do so could be impacted by possible changes to the indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of cognizant india.
stock-based compensation. utilizing the fair value recognition provisions prescribed by the authoritative guidance, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised, the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. in addition, for performance stock units, we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period. if actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.
derivative financial instruments. derivative financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that each derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. our derivative financial instruments consist of foreign exchange forward contracts. we estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows model. this model utilizes various assumptions, including, but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows, discount rates, and credit risk factors. the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
investments. our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of time deposits, mutual funds invested in fixed income securities and u.s. dollar denominated corporate bonds, municipal bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, debt issuances by the u.s. government, u.s. government agencies, foreign governments and supranational entities and asset-backed securities. the asset-backed securities included government national mortgage association (gnma) mortgage backed securities and securities backed by auto loans, credit card receivables, and other receivables. the years of issuance of our asset-backed securities fall in the 2005 to 2014 range.
we utilize various inputs to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio. to the extent they exist, unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets (level 1) or quoted prices on similar assets (level 2) are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio. in the absence of quoted prices or liquid markets, valuation techniques would be used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (level 3). valuation techniques are based on various assumptions, including, but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows, discount rates, rate of return, and adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity. a significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using level 3 inputs. the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our security valuation methodologies.
we periodically evaluate if unrealized losses, as determined based on the security valuation methodologies discussed above, on individual securities classified as available-for-sale in the investment portfolio are considered to be other-than-temporary. the analysis of other-than-temporary impairment requires the use of various assumptions, including, but not limited to, the length of time an investment's book value is greater than fair value, the severity of the investment's decline, any credit deterioration of the investment, whether management intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is generally recorded to income and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
business combinations. the application of business combination accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. the allocation of the purchase price utilizes significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. the significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the timing and amount of future revenue and cash flows based on, among other things, anticipated growth rates and customer attrition rates, and the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows.
long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles. we review long-lived assets and certain finite-lived identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
52
be recoverable. in general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. if such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. we evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. when determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including discount rates and projections of future cash flows. any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. based upon our most recent valuation of goodwill, there are no significant risks of impairment for any of our reporting units. as of december 31, 2014, our goodwill balance was $2,413.6 million.
recently adopted accounting pronouncement in july 2013, the fasb issued new guidance which requires the netting of any unrecognized tax benefits against all available same-jurisdiction deferred income tax carryforward assets that would apply if the uncertain tax positions were settled. we adopted this standard on january 1, 2014. as of december 31, 2014, we netted an unrecognized tax benefit of $94,784 against same-jurisdiction non-current deferred income tax assets. in our december 31, 2013 consolidated statement of financial position, we reclassified $74,196 from "other non-current liabilities" to non-current "deferred income tax assets, net" to conform to current period's presentation. the adoption of this standard had no effect on our consolidated results of operations or stockholder's equity.
new accounting pronouncement in may 2014, the fasb issued a standard on revenue from contracts with customers. the new standard sets forth a single comprehensive model for recognizing and reporting revenue. the standard also requires additional financial statement disclosures that will enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts. the new standard will be effective for periods beginning on or after january 1, 2017. early adoption is not permitted. the standard allows for two methods of adoption: the full retrospective adoption, which requires the standard to be applied to each prior period presented, or the modified retrospective adoption, which requires the cumulative effect of adoption to be recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. we are currently evaluating the effect the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

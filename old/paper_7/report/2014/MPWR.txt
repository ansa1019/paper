item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear under item 8 in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview we are a leading company in high performance power solutions. founded in 1997, we pioneered integrated power semiconductor solutions and power delivery architectures. our mission is to provide innovative power solutions in cloud computing, telecommunications, industrial and automotive, and consumer market segments. we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated, smaller in size, more energy efficient, more accurate with respect to performance specifications and, consequently, more cost-effective than many competing solutions. we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories.
we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain products. we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns, but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance.
we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits ("ics"). this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs, while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths.
following the introduction of a product, our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up. typical lead time for orders is fewer than 90 days. these factors, combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer, make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult.
we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in asia, where the products we produce are incorporated into end-user products. our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia was 91% and 90% for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter product family which services the communications, storage and computing, consumer and industrial markets. we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new products, enter new market segments, gain market share, manage litigation risk, diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity.
in july 2014, we completed the acquisition of sensima technology sa ("sensima"), a company located in switzerland that develops magnetic sensors for angle measurements as well as three-dimensional magnetic field sensing. the acquisition is expected to create new opportunities with customers by offering enhanced solutions in power management for key industries such as automotive, industrial and cloud computing. the purchase consideration consisted of an upfront cash payment of $11.7 million and additional consideration that is contingent upon sensima achieving a new product introduction and certain revenue and direct margin goals in 2016, with a fair value of $2.5 million at the date of acquisition. in addition, key employees received $1.7 million of time-based restricted stock units and up to $8.0 million of performance-based restricted stock units in connection with the transaction. these equity awards are considered arrangements for post-acquisition services and the related compensation expense is being recognized over the requisite service period. the results of operations of sensima have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, inventories, income taxes, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, and contingencies. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are, by their nature, uncertain and unpredictable, and depend upon, among other things, many factors outside of our control, such as demand for our products and economic conditions.  accordingly, our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ, perhaps significantly, from these estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
28
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fees charged for products delivered and the collectability of those fees. the application of these criteria has resulted in us generally recognizing revenue upon shipment (when title passes) to customers, including distributors, original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers.
our revenue consists primarily of sales of assembled and tested finished goods. we also sell die in wafer form to our customers and value-added resellers, and we receive royalty revenue from third parties and value-added resellers.
for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 92% and 91% of our distributor sales, respectively, including sales to our value-added resellers, were made through distribution arrangements with third parties. these arrangements do not include any special payment terms (normal payment terms are 30-45 days for our distributors), price protection or exchange rights. returns are limited to our standard product warranty. certain of our large distributors have contracts that include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months' purchases.
for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 8% and 9% of our distributor sales, respectively, were made through small distributors primarily based on purchase orders. these distributors typically have no stock rotation rights.
we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to the distributors for the following reasons:
(1)                                                the price is fixed or determinable at the date of sale. we do not offer special payment terms, price protection or price adjustments to distributors when we recognize revenue upon shipment.

(2)   the distributors are obligated to pay us and this obligation is not contingent on the resale of our products.
(3)   the distributors' obligation is unchanged in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage to the products.
(4)   the distributors have stand-alone economic substance apart from our relationship.
(5)   we do not have any obligations for future performance to directly bring about the resale of our products by the distributors.
(6)   the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated. we have the ability and the information necessary to track inventory sold to and held at our distributors. we maintain a history of returns and have the ability to estimate the stock rotation returns on a quarterly basis.
we maintain a sales reserve for stock rotation rights, which is based on historical experience of actual stock rotation returns on a per distributor basis, where available, and information related to products in the distribution channel. this reserve is recorded at the time of sale. historically, these returns were not material to our consolidated financial statements.  in the future, if we are not able to estimate our stock rotation returns accurately, we may have to recognize revenue when the distributors sell such inventory to end customers.
if we enter into arrangements that have rights of return that are not estimable, we recognize revenue under such arrangements only after the distributors have sold the products to end customers. three of our u.s. distributors have distribution agreements where revenue is recognized upon sale by these distributors to their end customers because these distributors have certain rights of return which management believes are not estimable. the deferred revenue balance from these distributors as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 was $2.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively. the deferred costs as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 were $0.2 million.
we generally provide a one to two-year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship. under this warranty, we will repair the goods, provide replacements at no charge, or, under certain circumstances, provide a refund to the customer for defective products. estimated warranty returns and warranty costs are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized.
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or its current estimated market value.  we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand, based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. conversely, if market conditions are more favorable, inventory may be sold that was previously reserved.
29
valuation of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets we evaluate intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. we perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. impairment of intangible assets is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the assets and their carrying value. impairment for goodwill occurs if the fair value of a reporting unit including goodwill is less than its carrying value and is recognized based on the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill. the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values of goodwill and intangible assets are complex and subjective. they can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and revenue forecasts. if there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future, including macroeconomic and market conditions, we may be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets.
accounting for income taxes asc 740-10, income taxes - overall, prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. this interpretation also provides guidance on classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. in accordance with asc 740-10, we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. we also recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting or tax laws in the u.s. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. in addition, we recognize liabilities for potential u.s. and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made. we have calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments primarily related to transfer pricing, cost sharing and our international tax structure exposure.
as of december 31, 2014, and 2013, we had a valuation allowance of $19.1 million and $16.7 million, respectively, attributable to management's determination that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets in the u.s. will not be realized. should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made. likewise, in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
as a result of the cost sharing arrangements with our international subsidiaries (cost share arrangements), relatively small changes in costs that are not subject to sharing under the cost share arrangements can significantly impact the overall profitability of the u.s. entity. because of the u.s. entity's inconsistent earnings history and uncertainty of future earnings, we have determined that it is more likely than not that the u.s. deferred tax benefits will not be realized.
contingencies we are a party to actions and proceedings incident to our business in the ordinary course of business, including litigation regarding our intellectual property, challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property and claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. the pending proceedings involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend. in addition, from time to time, we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities. when this occurs, we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded. in making this determination, management may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. based on the facts and circumstances in each matter, we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated. if we determine a loss is probable and estimable, we record a contingent loss. in determining the amount of a contingent loss, we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations, prior case history and other factors. should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. alternatively, if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted, for example, if a particular contingent loss does not occur, the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations.
30
stock-based compensation we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. we use the black-scholes model to estimate the fair value of our options and shares issued under employee stock purchase plan. the fair value of time-based and performance-based restricted stock units is based on the grant date share price. the fair value of market-based restricted stock units is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model.
we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant-date fair value for all share-based payment awards that are expected to vest. this expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire awards, unless the awards are subject to performance or market conditions, in which case we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period of each separate vesting tranche. for the performance-based awards, we recognize compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance criteria set by the board of directors will be achieved. for the market-based awards, compensation expense is not reversed if the market condition is not satisfied. if the actual performance targets achieved differ significantly from those projected by management, additional stock-based compensation expense may be recorded for the performance-based awards, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. furthermore, the amount of stock-based compensation that we recognize is based on an expected forfeiture rate. if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stock-based compensation costs and the actual forfeitures which become known over time, we may change the forfeiture rate, which could have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense.
recent accounting pronouncements in july 2013, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2013-11, presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. the standard gives guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists, with the purpose of reducing diversity in practice. this new standard requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax positions. we adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2014 prospectively and the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. the standard's core principle is that an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. under the new standard, entities will apply the following five-step model when evaluating revenue contracts with customers:
(1)   identify the contract with a customer.

(2)   identify the performance obligations in the contract.

(3)   determine the transaction price.

(4)   allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.

(5)   recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

the new standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective application in the adoption of this standard. we will adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2017 and are evaluating the transition method and the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

revenue for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $282.5 million, an increase of $44.4 million, or 18.7%, from $238.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was due to higher sales of both dc to dc and lighting control products, as unit shipments increased 37% due to higher market demand with current customers and additional design wins with new customers, which were offset in part by a 13% decrease in average sales prices. revenue from our dc to dc products was $253.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $41.7 million, or 19.8%, from the same period in 2013. this increase was primarily due to higher sales of our dc to dc converters, offset in part by lower sales of our mini-monsters products. revenue from our lighting control products was $29.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $2.7 million, or 10.1%, compared with the same period in 2013.
revenue for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $238.1 million, an increase of $24.3 million, or 11.4%, from $213.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. this increase was due to higher sales of both dc to dc and lighting control products, as unit shipments increased 18% due to higher market demand with current customers and additional design wins with new customers, which were offset in part by a 6% decrease in average sales prices. revenue from our dc to dc products was $211.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $22.6 million, or 12.0%, from the same period in 2012. this increase was primarily due to higher sales of our dc to dc converters, mini-monsters, pmics and battery charger products. revenue from our lighting control products was $26.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $1.7 million, or 6.7%, compared with the same period in 2012.

cost of revenue was $129.9 million, or 46.0% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2014, and $110.2 million, or 46.3% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2013. the $19.7 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 37% increase in unit shipments, which was partially offset by a 14% decrease in the average direct cost of units shipped. in addition, the increase in cost of revenue was driven by an increase of $0.8 million in the provision for inventory reserve, and an increase of $0.7 million in amortization of intangible assets from the sensima acquisition in july 2014.
gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, was 54.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to 53.7% for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher absorption of in-house test manufacturing overhead, compared to the same period in 2013. this increase was partially offset by an increase in the provision for inventory reserve and an increase in the amortization of intangible assets from the sensima acquisition in july 2014.
cost of revenue was $110.2 million, or 46.3% of revenue, for the year ended december, 2013, and $100.7 million, or 47.1% of revenue, for the year ended december, 2012. the $9.5 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an 18% increase in unit shipments, which was partially offset by an 8% decrease in the average direct cost of units shipped. the increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in the provision for inventory reserve.
gross margin was 53.7% for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared to 52.9% for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products and a lower provision for inventory reserve. this increase was partially offset by lower absorption of in-house test manufacturing overhead.
research and development research and development expenses primarily consist of salary and benefit expenses, bonuses and stock-based compensation expenses for design and product engineers, expenses related to new product development and supplies, and facility costs.

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, reduced by accounts payable, accrued compensation and related benefits, and other accrued liabilities. as of december 31, 2014, we had working capital of $271.3 million, compared with working capital of $253.6 million as of december 31, 2013. the $17.7 million increase in working capital was due to a $16.1 million increase in current assets and a $1.6 million decrease in current liabilities. the increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents, an increase in inventory, and an increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in short-term investments. the decrease in current liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in accrued compensation and related benefits, and a decrease in other accrued liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable.

for the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $74.1 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $8.0 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to higher sales and an increase in shipments in the fourth quarter of 2014. the increase in inventories was primarily due to an increase in strategic wafer and die bank inventories as well as an increase in finished goods necessary to meet anticipated future demand. the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet anticipated future demand. the decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by the release of the liability related to the o2 micro litigation, partially offset by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan. for the year ended december 31, 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $60.7 million, primarily due to cash contributed from our operating results during the year and the cash payment received in connection with the o2 micro litigation recorded as a liability as of december 31, 2013. these increases were partially offset by increases in both inventories and accounts receivable. the increase in accounts receivable resulted primarily from an increase in shipments. the increase in inventories was primarily due to an increase in strategic wafer and die bank inventories as well as finished goods to meet anticipated future demand. for the year ended december 31, 2012, net cash provided by operating activities was $24.9 million, primarily reflecting cash contributed from our operating results, partially offset by $27.8 million increase in working capital requirements.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $9.4 million, primarily due to net cash of $11.6 million paid to acquire sensima, purchases of property and equipment of $9.5 million, and net purchases of investments of $7.1 million, partially offset by proceeds of $4.7 million from the redemption of auction-rate securities. for the year ended december 31, 2013, net cash used in investing activities was $54.3 million, primarily reflecting net purchases of short-term investments and purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from the redemption of auction-rate securities. for the year ended december 31, 2012, net cash used in investing activities was $26.8 million related to our investment in equipment, building improvements at our new headquarters located in san jose, california and net purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by proceeds from the redemption of auction-rate securities.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash used in financing activities was $39.2 million, primarily reflecting $41.2 million used in repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program and $11.7 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold restricted stock units ("rsus"), partially offset by $14.0 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. for the year ended december 31, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was $18.9 million, primarily reflecting $40.0 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $20.6 million used in repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program. for the year ended december 31, 2012, net cash used in financing activities was $19.6 million, primarily reflecting the $35.7 million cash dividends paid to stockholders on december 28, 2012, partially offset by $15.2 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.
in july 2013, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes us to repurchase up to $100 million in the aggregate of our common stock through june 30, 2015. all shares are retired upon repurchase. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we repurchased a total of 1.1 million shares for $41.2 million, at an average price of $39.19 per share. for the year ended december 31, 2013, we repurchased a total of 0.7 million shares for $20.6 million, at an average price of $31.06 per share. as of december 31, 2014, $38.2 million remained available for future repurchases under the program.
in june 2014, our board of directors approved a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. in addition, rsu awards contain rights to receive dividend equivalents, which entitle employees who hold rsus to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. dividend equivalents accrued on the rsus are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill their service requirement during the vesting periods. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling $11.7 million. in addition, our board of directors authorized dividend payments totaling $5.8 million to stockholders of record on december 31, 2014, which will be paid on january 15, 2015.
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short-term investments, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. we anticipate the cash used for future dividends, dividend equivalents and the stock repurchase program will come from our current domestic cash and cash generated from ongoing u.s. operations. if cash held by our international subsidiaries is needed for these payments, we may be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds.
in the future, in order to strengthen our financial position, in the event of unforeseen circumstances, or in the event we need to fund our growth in future financial periods, we may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following: issuing equity securities, issuing debt or convertible debt securities, incurring indebtedness secured by our assets, or selling certain product lines and/or portions of our business. there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
from time to time, we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines, technologies, businesses and companies, and we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates. any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities, assumptions of debt, and/or payment of cash consideration.  we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisition, through either the issuance of equity and debt securities or incurring indebtedness secured by our assets. if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution.

______________
(1)   outstanding purchase commitments primarily consist of wafer purchases from our foundries, assembly services and license arrangements.

(2)   other long-term obligations include future cash payments to satisfy long-term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, which primarily consist of employee deferred compensation plan liabilities, contingent consideration related to the sensima acquisition, and accrued dividend equivalents. because of the uncertainty as to the timing of distributions related to a portion of the employee deferred compensation plan liabilities, we have excluded estimated obligations of $0.2 million from the table above. in addition, because of the uncertainty as to the timing of payments related to our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, we have excluded estimated obligations of $5.3 million from the table above.

off balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2014, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4) of the securities and exchange commission's regulation s-k.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material.
overview on an equivalent basis, our production in 2014 increased by 29% from 2013. we produced 531.8 bcfe, or 1.5 bcfe per day, in 2014, compared to 413.6 bcfe, or 1.1 bcfe per day, in 2013. natural gas production increased by 113.8 bcf, or 29%, to 508.0 bcf in 2014 compared to 394.2 bcf in 2013. this increase was primarily the result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program in pennsylvania, partially offset by lower production primarily in oklahoma and west texas as a result of certain non-core asset dispositions in the fourth quarter of 2013 and normal production declines in texas and west virginia. crude oil/condensate/ngl production increased by 0.7 mbbls, or 23%, from 3.2 mmbbls in 2013 to 4.0 mmbbls in 2014. this increase was the result of higher production resulting from our oil-focused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas, partially offset by lower production associated with certain non-core asset dispositions in oklahoma in the fourth quarter of 2013.
our financial results depend on many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. our average realized natural gas price for 2014 was $3.28 per mcf, 8% lower than the $3.56 per mcf price realized in 2013. our average realized crude oil price for 2014 was $88.50 per bbl, 12% lower than the $101.13 per bbl price realized in 2013. these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives. for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices, refer to "results of operations" in item 7.
commodity prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control. historically, commodity prices have been volatile, and we expect them to remain volatile. commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. as a result, we cannot accurately predict future natural gas, ngl and crude oil prices and, therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program, production volumes or future revenues. in addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success. see "risk factors-natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business" and "risk factors-our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable" in item 1a.
in december 2014, we recorded a $771.0 million impairment of oil and gas properties in certain non-core fields, primarily in east texas. the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and management's decision not to pursue any further activity in these non-core areas in the current price environment.
effective april 1, 2014, we elected to discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis. subsequent to april 1, 2014, our derivative instruments were accounted for on a mark-to-market basis with changes in fair value recognized currently in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. as a result of these mark-to-market adjustments, we will likely experience volatility in our earnings from time to time due to commodity price volatility. refer to "impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues" below and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
we drilled 200 gross wells (176.5 net) with a success rate of 99.5% in 2014 compared to 181 gross wells (153.5 net) with a success rate of 98.3% in 2013. our 2014 total capital and exploration spending was approximately $1.6 billion (excluding the eagle ford shale acquisitions discussed below) compared to $1.2 billion in 2013. the increase in capital spending was the result of our drilling programs in the marcellus shale and eagle ford shale. we allocate our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating areas based on return expectations, availability of services and human resources.
our 2015 drilling program includes approximately $900.0 million in capital and exploration expenditures and approximately $69.8 million in expected contributions to our equity method investments. these expenditures are expected to be funded by operating cash flow, existing cash and, if required, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly.

acquisitions and divestitures in december 2014, we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately $30.5 million and paid total cash consideration as of the closing date of approximately $29.6 million, which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs. the acquisition was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
in october 2014, we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately $210.0 million and paid total net cash consideration as of the closing date of approximately $185.2 million, which reflects the purchase price and adjustments of approximately $17.4 million for consents that the seller was unable to obtain for certain leaseholds prior to closing and approximately $8.0 million for the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs. the acquisition was funded with proceeds from the private placement of senior unsecured fixed rate notes completed in september 2014.
in october 2014, we completed the divestiture of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for approximately $44.3 million. total cash consideration received by the company as of the closing date was approximately $42.8 million, which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments.
financial condition capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of cash in 2014 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and oil production, the issuance of fixed rate notes and proceeds from the sale of certain oil and gas properties during the year. these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital and exploration expenditures, repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and related interest payments, share repurchases and the payment of dividends. see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow.
operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses. prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile, including seasonal influences and demand; however, the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years. in addition, fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures. see "results of operations" for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues.
our working capital is also substantially influenced by the variables discussed above. from time to time, our working capital will reflect a surplus, while at other times it will reflect a deficit. this fluctuation is not unusual. we believe we have adequate availability under our revolving credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements.

operating activities. net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 increased by $211.9 million over 2013. this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses (excluding non-cash expenses) and an increase in working capital. the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production, partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices. equivalent production volumes increased by 29% for 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of higher natural gas and oil production. average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 8% and 12%, respectively, for 2014 compared to 2013.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 increased by $372.4 million over 2012. this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses (excluding non-cash expenses) and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities. the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production, partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices. equivalent production volumes increased by 55% for 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production. average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 3% and less than 1%, respectively, for 2013 compared to 2012.
37
see "results of operations" for additional information relative to commodity price, production and operating expense movements. we are unable to predict future commodity prices and, as a result, cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities. realized prices may decline in future periods.
investing activities. cash flows used in investing activities increased by $746.6 million from 2013 to 2014 due to a $284.9 million increase in capital and exploration expenditures, a decrease of $284.0 million in proceeds from the sale of assets, a $214.7 million increase in acquisition expenditures related to the acquisitions of eagle ford shale assets that closed in the fourth quarter of 2014, and a $19.2 million increase in capital contributions associated with our equity investments. partially offsetting the increases was a $56.2 million decrease in restricted cash related to the release of funds by our qualified intermediary due to a lapse in the statutory holding period and the funding of oil and gas lease acquisitions during 2014 associated with like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to section 1031 of the internal revenue code.
cash flows used in investing activities increased by $152.7 million from 2012 to 2013 due to a $266.8 million increase in capital and exploration expenditures and a $12.0 million increase associated with our equity investment in constitution. these increases were partially offset by a net $126.1 million increase in proceeds from the sale of assets, a portion of which was retained in a qualified intermediary and recognized as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet.
financing activities. cash flows provided by financing activities increased by $539.6 million from 2013 to 2014 due to $545.0 million of higher net borrowings and a decrease in share repurchases of $25.8 million, partially offset by a decrease of $20.3 million in tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation, an $8.0 million increase in dividends paid and an increase in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of $2.9 million.
cash flows used in financing activities increased by $227.9 million from 2012 to 2013 due to $164.6 million of stock repurchases, $77.0 million of lower net borrowings and an increase in dividends paid of $8.5 million, partially offset by an $18.9 million increase in the tax benefit associated with our stock‐based compensation and a decrease in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of $2.3 million.
in september 2014, we completed a private placement of $925 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.65%, consisting of amounts due in 2021, 2024 and 2026.
effective april 15, 2014, the lenders under our revolving credit facility approved an increase in our borrowing base from $2.3 billion to $3.1 billion as part of the annual redetermination under the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement. the commitments under the revolving credit facility remain unchanged at $1.4 billion. see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
at december 31, 2014, we had $140.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.4% compared to $460.0 million of borrowings outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.0% at december 31, 2013. as of december 31, 2014, we had $1.3 billion available for future borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit facility and fixed rate notes as of december 31, 2014.
we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity. our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt. management believes that, with internally generated cash flow, existing cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility, we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our strong financial position.

_______________________________________________________________________________
(1)   includes $140.0 million and $460.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we repurchased 4.3 million shares for a total cost of $138.9 million and 4.8 million shares for a total cost of $164.6 million, respectively. during 2014 and 2013, we also paid dividends of $33.3 million ($0.08 per share) and $25.2 million ($0.06 per share) on our common stock, respectively. a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990.
capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital and exploration expenditures, excluding any significant property acquisitions, with cash generated from operations and, when necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year.
the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures:

_______________________________________________________________________________
(1)   interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates associated with our fixed rate notes outstanding at december 31, 2014. interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december 31, 2014 outstanding balance of $140.0 million will be outstanding through the may 2017 maturity date and that our fixed rate notes will remain outstanding through their respective maturity dates. a constant interest rate of 2.4% was assumed for the interest payments on our revolving credit facility, which was the december 31, 2014 weighted-average interest rate. actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions.
(2)   in january 2015, we entered into a natural gas transportation agreement associated with our production in pennsylvania, which increased our future aggregate obligations under our transportation commitments by approximately $105.9 million over the next 10 years, which is not included in the table above. for further information on our obligations under transportation and gathering agreements, drilling rig commitments and operating leases, see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
(3)   for further information on our equity investment contribution commitment, see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
amounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december 31, 2014 was $126.7 million. see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
we have no off-balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations.
potential impact of our critical accounting policies readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. our most significant policies are discussed below.
successful efforts method of accounting we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed. development costs, including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized.
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. the process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. the extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. the process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the sec, such as crude oil and natural gas prices. additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves.
40
our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents, independent petroleum engineers, who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate. for more information regarding reserve estimation, including historical reserve revisions, refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8.
our rate of recording dd&a expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves, which are utilized in our unit-of-production calculation. if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record dd&a expense would increase, reducing net income. such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields. a 5% positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of $0.05 per mcfe and an increase of $0.05 per mcfe, respectively, on our dd&a rate. revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dd&a rate. it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10% in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of $0.05 per mcfe and an increase of $0.07 per mcfe, respectively, on our total dd&a rate. these estimated impacts are based on current data, and actual events could require different adjustments to our dd&a rate.
in addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards. due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future.
carrying value of oil and gas properties we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. if the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process, historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. in the event that commodity prices remain low or decline, there could be a significant revision in the future. fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil.
unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience, our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives. average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. historically, the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years. the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling. we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage, especially in exploratory areas. if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year, the amortization would increase by approximately $21.8 million or decrease by approximately $14.8 million, respectively, per year.
as these properties are developed and reserves are proved, the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made. the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program.
asset retirement obligations the majority of our asset retirement obligations (aro) relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations, pipelines, processing plants and compressors. we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred, with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs, timing of settlements, inflation rates and discount rate. in periods subsequent to initial measurement, the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the units-of-production method, while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time (accretion expense) are reflected as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
41
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. at the end of each quarterly period, these instruments are marked-to-market.
through march 31, 2014, we elected to designate our commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. effective april 1, 2014, we elected to discontinue hedge accounting for our commodity derivatives on a prospective basis. accordingly, the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were effective was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet. the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain (loss) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations.
our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties. such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil, basis differentials, volatility factors and interest rates, such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term, as applicable. these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness. the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for non-performance risk. we measure the non-performance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions, while our non-performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks.
employee benefit plans our costs of long-term employee benefits, particularly postretirement benefits, are incurred over long periods of time, and involve many uncertainties over those periods. the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties, and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. it is management's responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties. it also is management's responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions. significant assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends. see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion relative to our employee benefit plans.
stock-based compensation we account for stock-based compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards. under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equity-classified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liability-classified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is generally the vesting period. to calculate fair value, we use either a monte carlo or black-scholes valuation model, as determined by the specific provisions of the award. the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life, volatility and other factors. stock-based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
recent accounting pronouncements in april 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) no. 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. the guidance applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups as held for sale after the effective date. the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014. we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, as a new topic, accounting standards codification topic 606. the new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. the core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. this asu is effective beginning in fiscal year 2017 and can be adopted either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. we are currently evaluating the effect that adopting this guidance will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
42
in august 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-15, presentation of financial statements - going concern, as a new sub-topic, accounting standards codification sub-topic 205.40. the new going concern standard codifies in generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. this asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
other issues and contingencies regulations.    our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. see "regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production," "natural gas marketing, gathering and transportation," "federal regulation of petroleum," "pipeline safety regulation," and "environmental and safety regulations" in the "other business matters" section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations.
restrictive covenants.    our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments. among other requirements, our revolving credit agreement and our fixed rate notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0 and a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 1.75 to 1.0. our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. at december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit agreement and fixed rate notes. in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants, we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender, which, if granted, would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation.
operating risks and insurance coverage.    our business involves a variety of operating risks. see "risk factors-we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses" in item 1a. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience, the areas in which we operate and market conditions.
commodity pricing and risk management activities.    our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil. declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically. historically, natural gas and crude oil prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. in particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our long-lived assets. because our reserves are predominantly natural gas (approximately 96% of equivalent proved reserves), changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices.
the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices. generally, if the related commodity index declines, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control. however, management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of commodity derivatives. most recently, we have used commodity derivatives such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue. under both arrangements, there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions.
results of operations
2014 and 2013 compared we reported net income for 2014 of $104.5 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to net income for 2013 of $279.8 million, or $0.67 per share. the decrease in net income was due to higher operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in operating revenues and an increase in income tax benefit.

natural gas revenues the increase in natural gas revenues of $185.4 million is due to higher production, partially offset by lower natural gas prices. the increase in our production was the result of our marcellus shale drilling program in pennsylvania, partially offset by lower production primarily in oklahoma and west texas as a result of certain non-core asset dispositions in the fourth quarter of 2013 and normal production declines in texas and west virginia.
crude oil and condensate revenues the increase in crude oil and condensate revenues of $22.5 million is due to higher production, partially offset by lower crude oil prices. the increase in production was a result of our oil-focused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas, partially offset by lower production associated with certain non-core asset dispositions in oklahoma and west texas in the fourth quarter of 2013.
gain (loss) on derivative instruments effective april 1, 2014, we elected to discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis. subsequent to april 1, 2014, our derivative instruments were accounted for on a mark-to-market basis with changes in fair value recognized currently in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. gain (loss) on derivative instruments includes an $81.7 million gain related to the change in fair value of realized cash settlements of derivative instruments previously frozen in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and a $137.6 million unrealized mark-to-market gain on our commodity derivative instruments.

total costs and expenses from operations increased by $869.9 million from 2013 to 2014. the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:
•   direct operations increased $4.7 million largely due to higher operating costs as a result of higher production, an increase in disposal and recycling costs related to our marcellus shale operations and an increase in costs associated with oil processing and related fuel charges related to our eagle ford shale operations. partially offsetting these increases were lower costs associated with certain non-core assets in oklahoma and west texas that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2013.
•   transportation and gathering increased $119.8 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher production, slightly higher transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements in late 2013 and during 2014.
•   brokered natural gas increased $0.1 million from 2013 to 2014. see the preceding table titled "brokered natural gas" for further analysis.
•   taxes other than income increased $4.0 million due to $2.5 million higher drilling impact fees associated with our marcellus shale drilling activities, $2.5 million higher production taxes and $0.9 million higher franchise and other taxes. production taxes increased due to higher oil production in south texas, offset by taxes associated with certain non-core assets in oklahoma and west texas that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2013. these increases are partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in ad valorem taxes.
•   exploration increased $10.6 million as a result of higher exploratory dry hole costs of $7.5 million and higher geophysical and geological and other expenses.
•   depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $18.3 million due to a $36.2 million decrease in amortization of unproved properties in 2014 due to lower amortization rates as a result of favorable results from our drilling program in pennsylvania. this decrease was partially offset by a net increase in depreciation and depletion of $14.6 million, consisting of a $167.6 million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes for 2014 compared to 2013, partially offset by a decrease of $153.0 million due to a lower dd&amp;a rate of $1.13 per mcfe for 2014 compared to $1.42 per mcfe for 2013. the lower dd&amp;a rate was primarily due to lower cost of reserve additions associated with our marcellus shale drilling program and the impact of the disposition of higher rate fields in oklahoma and west texas in the fourth quarter of 2013.
•   impairment of oil and gas properties was $771.0 million in 2014 due to the impairment of certain non-core fields, primarily in east texas. the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late
46
2014 and management's decision not to pursue activity in these non-core areas in the current price environment. there was no impairment in 2013.
•   general and administrative decreased $22.0 million due to lower stock-based compensation expense of $30.4 million associated with the mark-to-market of our liability-based performance awards and our supplemental employee incentive plan due to changes in our stock price during 2014 compared to 2013 and lower employee-related expenses. these decreases were partially offset by increases in professional fees.
earnings (loss) on equity method investments. the increase in equity method investments is the result of the increase in our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2014 compared to 2013.
gain (loss) on sale of assets.    during 2014, we recognized an aggregate gain of $17.1 million primarily due to the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas. during 2013, we recognized an aggregate net gain of $21.4 million, which includes a $19.4 million gain from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles and a $17.5 million loss from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma, texas and kansas. we also sold various other proved and unproved properties in 2013 for a net gain of $19.5 million.
interest expense.    interest expense increased $7.7 million as a result of an increase in interest expense of $9.7 million associated with our private placement in september 2014 of $925 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.65%, higher commitment fees of $2.3 million and increased amortization of debt issuance costs of $1.1 million. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $3.1 million due to the repayment of $75.0 million of our 7.33% weighted-average fixed rate notes in july 2013 and $1.1 million associated with our revolving credit facility due to a decrease in weighted-average borrowings based on daily balances of approximately $410.0 million compared to approximately $454.4 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively.
income tax expense.    income tax expense decreased $277.8 million due to a decrease in pretax income and a lower effective tax rate.  the effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 were (222.4)% and 42.4%, respectively. the effective tax rate was lower as a result of a change in estimated net deferred state tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, which were based on updated state apportionment factors in states in which we operate.
2013 and 2012 compared we reported net income for 2013 of $279.8 million, or $0.67 per share, compared to net income for 2012 of $131.7 million, or $0.31 per share. the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues, partially offset higher operating expenses.

natural gas revenues the increase in natural gas revenues of $471.1 million is due to higher production, partially offset by lower natural gas prices. the increase in our production was the result of our marcellus shale drilling program in pennsylvania and expanded infrastructure in the area, partially offset by lower production primarily in texas, oklahoma and west virginia due to reduced natural gas drilling in these areas and normal production declines.
crude oil and condensate revenues the increase in crude oil and condensate revenues of $63.5 million is due to higher production associated with our oil‐focused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and, to a lesser extent, oklahoma, partially offset by lower crude oil prices.

total costs and expenses from operations increased by $268.1 million from 2012 to 2013. the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:
•   direct operations increased $22.6 million largely due to higher operating costs primarily driven by higher production. in addition, we experienced higher costs associated with oil separation and processing and related fuel charges as a result of more stringent oil pipeline quality requirements in south texas related to our eagle ford operations, higher plugging and abandonment costs primarily in east texas and higher environmental and regulatory costs. partially offsetting these increases were a decrease in workover activity and lower lease maintenance costs.
•   transportation and gathering increased $86.2 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher production, slightly higher transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements primarily in northeast pennsylvania and south texas throughout the second half of 2012.
•   brokered natural gas increased $1.4 million from 2012 to 2013. see the preceding table titled "brokered natural gas" for further analysis.

•   taxes other than income decreased $5.8 million due to lower drilling impact fees associated with our marcellus shale drilling activities. full year 2012 included $8.3 million related to the initial assessment of drilling impact fees associated with 2011 and prior period wells. in addition, franchise, sales and use and ad valorem taxes decreased year over year. these decreases were partially offset by higher production taxes as a result of an increase in oil production in south texas.
•   exploration decreased $19.3 million due to lower exploratory dry hole costs of $13.6 million primarily due to our brown dense/smackover exploratory well in union county, arkansas that was recorded in 2012. there were no significant exploratory dry hole costs recorded in 2013. in addition, geophysical and geological expenses decreased $7.0 million due to fewer requirements for the acquisition and processing of seismic data.
•   depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $199.6 million, of which $234.4 million was due to higher equivalent production volumes for 2013 compared to 2012, partially offset by a decrease of $70.8 million due to a lower dd&amp;a rate of $1.42 per mcfe for 2013 compared to $1.58 per mcfe for 2012. the lower dd&amp;a rate was primarily due to lower cost of reserve additions associated with our 2013 and 2012 drilling programs. in addition, amortization of unproved properties increased $35.5 million primarily due to an increase in amortization rates as a result of our ongoing evaluation of our unproved properties and undeveloped leasehold acquisitions during the year.
•   general and administrative decreased $16.6 million due to lower pension expense of $19.5 million associated with the liquidation of our pension plan that occurred in the second quarter of 2012, a decrease in legal expenses of $9.0 million and $2.2 million of lower charitable contribution costs associated with the funding of the construction of a hospital in northeast pennsylvania in 2012. these decreases are partially offset by $18.3 million of higher stock‐based compensation expense associated with the mark‐to‐market of our liability‐based performance awards due to changes in our stock price during 2013 compared to 2012 and the achievement of the interim and final triggers of our supplemental incentive compensation plan during 2013.
gain (loss) on sale of assets.    during 2013, we recognized an aggregate net gain of $21.4 million, which includes a $19.4 million gain from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles and a $17.5 million loss from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma, texas and kansas. we also sold various other proved and unproved properties for a net gain of $19.5 million. during 2012, we recognized an aggregate net gain of $50.6 million, which includes a $67.0 million gain associated with the sale of certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas, partially offset by an $18.2 million loss on the sale of certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas.
interest expense.    interest expense decreased $2.3 million as a result lower debt extinguishment costs of $1.3 million associated with our revolving credit facility amendment in may 2012 and lower interest expense as a result of the repayment of $75.0 million of our 7.33% weighted‐average fixed rate notes in july 2013. these decreases were offset by an increase in interest expense related to our revolving credit facility due to an increase in weighted‐average borrowings based on daily balances of approximately $454.4 million during 2013 compared to approximately $283.8 million 2012, partially offset by a lower weighted‐average effective interest rate of approximately 2.3% during 2013 compared to approximately 3.0% during 2012.
income tax expense.    income tax expense increased $99.7 million due to an increase in pretax income offset by a lower effective tax rate. the effective tax rates for 2013 and 2012 were 42.4% and 44.6%, respectively. the effective tax rate was lower due to a decrease in the impact of our state rates used to determine our deferred state tax liabilities and assets reflected in our consolidated balance sheet.

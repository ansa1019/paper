part ii adjusted earnings increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to the impact of the revised rates and favorable weather, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense. adjusted earnings increased from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of progress energy results in 2013, the impact of the revised rates, net of higher depreciation and amortization expense and lower allowance for funds used during construction (afudc).
see "results of operations" below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations, as well as a detailed discussion of financial results for each of duke energy's reportable business segments, as well as other.
2014 areas of focus and accomplishments in 2014, duke energy focused on achieving financial objectives, completing important strategic initiatives, including the agreement to sell the non-regulated midwest generation business and completion of a strategic review of the international business, advancing a platform of growth initiatives, operational excellence, and the strengthening of coal ash management practices and plans to accelerate basin closure strategies resulting from the dan river coal ash spill.
sale of the midwest generation business. in 2014, duke energy entered into a psa to sell the disposal group to dynegy for approximately $2.8 billion. this decision supports duke energy's strategy to focus investments on businesses with more predictable and less volatile earnings.
international energy operations. duke energy completed the strategic review of the international operations. as a result of the review, duke energy determined it is in the shareholders' best interest, at the present time, to continue to own, operate and create value through portfolio optimization and efficiency in the international operations. in addition, duke energy declared a taxable dividend of historical foreign earnings in the form of notes payable that will result in the repatriation of approximately $2.7 billion of cash held and expected to be generated by international energy over a period of up to eight years. the cash will help support the dividend and growth in the investment portfolio of the domestic businesses.
growth initiatives. in 2014, duke energy announced new growth initiatives representing a total investment of approximately $8 billion. these initiatives include:
•   duke energy indiana proposed transmission and distribution infrastructure improvement totaling $1.9 billion.
•   duke energy florida proposed approximately $1.8 billion investment in three new generation projects, a combined-cycle plant in citrus county, an uprate plan at the hines energy complex (hines) facility and acquisition of the osprey plant from calpine corporation (calpine).
•   duke energy progress proposed the acquisition of north carolina eastern municipal power agency's (ncempa) ownership interest in some of duke energy progress's existing nuclear and coal generation and the acquisition of solar projects in eastern north carolinas for a total amount of approximately $1.2 billion.
•   duke energy carolinas proposed construction of a combined-cycle natural gas plant at the william states lee generation facility at a cost of approximately $600 million.
•   commercial power proposed construction of the atlantic coast pipeline for a total investment of approximately $2 billion operational excellence of the nuclear fleet. duke energy's nuclear fleet set a company record for total electricity production and demonstrated a combined capacity factor at approximately 93 percent, the 16th consecutive year above 90 percent on this plant reliability measure.
deliver merger benefits. duke energy continues to focus on realizing benefits of the merger with progress energy. duke energy is on-track to achieve the $687 million of guaranteed savings for customers in the carolinas over five years. after two and a half years, duke energy carolinas and duke energy progress have generated over 60 percent of the guaranteed fuel and joint dispatch savings. in total 85 percent of the guaranteed benefit has been locked-in or delivered to duke energy's customers in the carolinas.
dan river coal ash spill and other coal ash management. duke energy has improved coal ash practices and accelerated plans to close its ash basins. comprehensive engineering reviews were completed at each of the ash basins, and a central internal organization was formed to manage all coal combustion products. duke energy also established an independent national coal ash management advisory board to help guide company strategy. excavation plans have been filed for four high priority sites identified in connection with north carolina coal ash management enacted in 2014 - dan river, asheville, riverbend, and l.v. sutton combined cycle facility (sutton). excavation plans have also been filed for the w.s. lee site in south carolina, and work is progressing on closure plans for the other ten north carolina sites.
on february 20, 2015, duke energy carolinas, duke energy progress and duke energy business services llc (debs), a wholly owned subsidiary of duke energy, each entered into a memorandum of plea agreement (plea agreements) in connection with an investigation initiated by the usdoj. the plea agreements are subject to the approval of the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina and, if approved, will end the grand jury investigation related to the dan river ash basin release and the management of coal ash basins at 14 plants in north carolina with coal ash basins.
under the plea agreements, the usdoj charged debs and duke energy progress with four misdemeanor cwa violations related to violations at duke energy progress' h.f. lee steam electric plant, cape fear steam electric plant and asheville steam electric generating plant. the united states department of justice charged duke energy carolinas and debs with five misdemeanor clean water act violations related to violations at duke energy carolinas' dan river steam station and riverbend steam station. debs, duke energy carolinas and duke energy progress also agreed (i) to a five-year probation period, (ii) to pay a total of approximately $68 million in fines and restitution and $34 million for community service and mitigation (the payments), and (iii) to establish environmental compliance plans subject to the oversight of a court-appointed monitor paid for by the companies for the duration of the probation period (iii) for duke energy carolinas and duke energy progress each to maintain $250 million under their master credit facility as security to meet their obligations under the pleas agreements, in addition to certain other conditions set out in the plea agreements. payments under the plea agreements will be borne by shareholders and are not tax deductible. duke energy corporation has agreed to issue a guarantee of all payments and performance due from the companies, including but not limited to payments for fines, restitution, community service, mitigation and the funding of, and obligations under, the environmental compliance plans. as a result of the plea agreements, duke energy carolinas and duke energy progress recognized charges of $72 million and $30 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2014. the amounts are recorded in operation, maintenance and other on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

part ii duke energy objectives - 2015 and beyond duke energy is committed to creating value and trust, while transforming our energy future. primary objectives for 2015 are:
•   growing and adapting the business and achieving financial objectives, including delivering on the 2015 adjusted diluted earnings per share (eps) guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75, and advancing viable future growth opportunities for regulated and nonregulated businesses
•   excelling in safety, operational performance and environmental stewardship
•   developing and engaging employees, while strengthening leadership
•   improving the lives of our customers and the vitality of our communities complete the sale of the nonregulated midwest generation business. in january 2015, ferc requested additional information regarding the proposed sale of the nonregulated midwest generation business. the parties to the transaction responded to ferc on february 6, 2015, and the comment period expired on february 23, 2015. ferc approval is the final regulatory approval required to close the transaction, which is expected by the end of the second quarter of 2015.
proceeds from the sale are expected to be deployed to recapitalize duke energy in a balanced manner, with a combination of an accelerated share repurchase and reductions in holding company debt. however, this plan could change depending on circumstances at the time of closing.
growth initiatives. duke energy will continue to pursue regulatory, state and federal approval of the growth projects. these projects will support long-term adjusted earnings growth of four to six percent and support duke energy's ability to continue providing its customers affordable, reliable energy from an increasingly diverse generation portfolio.
in the regulated utilities business, duke energy does not anticipate any significant base rate cases through 2017. growth is expected to be supported by retail and wholesale load growth and significant investments. duke energy expects to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion annually in regulated business growth projects. many of these projects will be recovered through riders such as transmission and distribution expenditures in indiana and ohio, as well as the crystal river 3 rider in florida and energy efficiency riders in the carolinas. the regulated wholesale business is expected to grow in 2015.
the commercial power renewables business is a significant component of the duke energy growth strategy. renewable projects enable duke energy to respond to customer interest in clean tech while increasing diversity in the generation portfolio. the portfolio of wind and solar is expected to continue growing as between $1 billion and $2 billion is deployed over the next three years .additionally, investments in the atlantic coast pipeline adds approximately $1 billion of capital spending through 2017.
continue the coal ash management strategy. in december 2014, u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) finalized the resource conservation and recovery act (rcra) related to coal combustion residuals (ccr) associated with the generation of electricity from coal. the rules classify coal ash as non-hazardous waste and provide guidelines related to the disposal of coal ash. duke energy will continue the compliance strategy with the north carolina coal ash management act of 2014 (coal ash act) and complete an evaluation of the provisions for this rule. duke energy will update ash management plans to comply with all state and federal regulations and begin excavation or other compliance work once plans and permits are approved.
results of operations in this section, duke energy provides analysis and discussion of earnings and factors affecting earnings on both a gaap and non-gaap basis.
management evaluates financial performance in part based on the non-gaap financial measures, adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted eps. these items are measured as income from continuing operations net of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the commercial power segment and special items including the operating results of the disposal group classified as discontinued operations for gaap purposes. special items represent certain charges and credits, which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis, although it is reasonably possible such charges and credits could recur. as result of the agreement in august 2014 to sell the disposal group to dynegy, the operating results of the disposal group are classified as discontinued operations, including a portion of the mark-to-market adjustments associated with derivative contracts. management believes that including the operating results of the disposal group classified as discontinued operations better reflects its financial performance and therefore has included these results in adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted eps. derivative contracts are used in duke energy's hedging of a portion of the economic value of its generation assets in the commercial power segment. the mark-to-market impact of derivative contracts is recognized in gaap earnings immediately and, if associated with the disposal group, classified as discontinued operations, as such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory treatment. the economic value of generation assets is subject to fluctuations in fair value due to market price volatility of input and output commodities (e.g., coal, electricity, natural gas). economic hedging involves both purchases and sales of those input and output commodities related to generation assets. operations of the generation assets are accounted for under the accrual method. management believes excluding impacts of mark-to-market changes of the derivative contracts from adjusted earnings until settlement better matches the financial impacts of the derivative contract with the portion of economic value of the underlying hedged asset. management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted eps provides useful information to investors, as it provides them an additional relevant comparison of duke energy's performance across periods. management uses these non-gaap financial measures for planning and forecasting and for reporting results to the duke energy board of directors (board of directors), employees, shareholders, analysts and investors concerning duke energy's financial performance. adjusted diluted eps is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. the most directly comparable gaap measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted eps are net income attributable to duke energy corporation and diluted eps attributable to duke energy corporation common shareholders, which include the dollar and per share impact of special items, mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the commercial power segment and discontinued operations.
36
part ii management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. segment income, as discussed below, includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. management also uses adjusted segment income as a measure of historical and anticipated future segment performance. adjusted segment income is a non-gaap financial measure, as it is based upon segment income adjusted for the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the commercial power segment and special items. management believes the presentation of adjusted segment income as presented provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of a segment's performance across periods. the most directly comparable gaap measure for adjusted segment income is segment income, which represents segment income from continuing operations, including any special items and the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the commercial power segment.
duke energy's adjusted earnings, adjusted diluted eps, and adjusted segment income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other entities may not calculate the measures in the same manner.
see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, "business segments," for a discussion of duke energy's segment structure.

part ii the variance in adjusted earnings for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily due to:
•   increased retail pricing and riders primarily resulting from the implementation of revised rates in most jurisdictions;
•   favorable weather in 2014 compared to 2013;
•   higher pjm capacity revenues for the nonregulated midwest generation business due to higher prices; and
•   higher results of the renewables business due to higher production from the wind and solar portfolios, lower costs and additional renewables investments.
partially offset by:
•   higher depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to higher depreciable asset base and lower reductions to cost of removal reserves;
•   higher operations and maintenance expense due to higher storm costs, the timing of fossil plant outages and the impact of nuclear outage cost levelization;
•   lower post in-service debt returns due to projects added to customer rates; and
•   higher property and other non-income taxes.
the variance in adjusted earnings for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared to 2012, was primarily due to:
•   the inclusion of progress energy results for the first six months of 2013;
•   increased retail pricing and riders resulting primarily from the implementation of revised rates in all jurisdictions; and
•   lower operating and maintenance expense resulting primarily from the adoption of nuclear outage cost levelization in the carolinas, lower benefit costs and merger synergies.
partially offsetting these increases was:
•   higher depreciation and amortization expense;
•   lower afudc;
•   lower nonregulated midwest gas generation results; and
•   incremental shares issued to complete the progress energy merger (impacts per diluted share amounts only).

year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 2013
regulated utilities' results were positively impacted by higher retail pricing and rate riders, favorable weather, an increase in wholesale power margins, higher weather-normal sales volumes, and 2013 impairments and other charges. these impacts were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, higher operation and maintenance costs, higher interest expense, and higher income tax expense. the following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
operating revenues. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $614 million increase in fuel revenues driven primarily by increased demand from electric retail customers resulting from favorable weather conditions, and higher fuel rates for electric retail customers for all jurisdictions, except north carolina. fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers;
•   a $556 million net increase in retail pricing primarily due to retail rate changes and updated rate riders;
•   a $216 million increase in electric sales (net of fuel revenue) to retail customers due to more favorable weather conditions. (i) for the year ended december 31, 2014 in the carolinas, cooling degree days were 4 percent below normal as compared with 15 percent below normal during the same period in 2013, and heating degree days were 11 percent above normal as compared with 4 percent above normal during the same period in 2013. (ii) for the year ended december 31, 2014 in the midwest, cooling degree days were 21 percent below normal as compared with 8 percent below normal during the same period in 2013, and heating degree days were 18 percent above normal as compared with 7 percent above normal during the same period in 2013. (iii) for the year ended december 31, 2014 in florida, cooling degree days were 3 percent below normal as compared with 2 percent above normal during the same period in 2013, and heating degree days were 4 percent above normal as compared with 35 percent below normal during the same period in 2013;
•   a $63 million increase in wholesale power revenues, net of sharing, primarily due to additional volumes and capacity charges for customers served under long-term contracts; and
•   a $21 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers (net of fuel revenue) reflecting increased demand.
partially offset by:
•   a $139 million decrease in gross receipts tax revenue due to the nc tax simplification and rate reduction act which terminated the collection of the north carolina gross receipts tax effective july 1, 2014.
39
part ii operating expenses. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $611 million increase in fuel expense (including purchased power and natural gas purchases for resale) primarily related to (i) higher volumes of coal, and oil used in electric generation due primarily to increased generation resulting from favorable weather conditions, (ii) higher natural gas prices, and (iii) the application of the nuclear electric insurance limited (neil) settlement proceeds in 2013 for duke energy florida;
•   a $436 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to increases in depreciation as a result of additional plant in service and amortization of regulatory assets, and higher 2013 reductions to cost of removal reserves in accordance with regulatory orders; and
•   a $292 million increase in operating and maintenance expense primarily due to a litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the dan river coal ash spill (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies," for additional information), higher storm costs, repairs and remediation expenses associated with the dan river coal ash discharge and other ash basin related assessment costs, and higher nuclear costs, including nuclear outage levelization costs, and higher environmental and operational costs that are recoverable in rates; partially offset by a 2013 crystal river unit 3 nuclear station (crystal river unit 3) related settlement matter, decreased benefits costs and 2013 donations for low-income customers and job training in accordance with 2013 north carolina utilities commission (ncuc) and public service commission of south carolina (pscsc) rate case orders.
partially offset by:
•   a $346 million decrease due to the 2013 impairment and other charges primarily related to crystal river unit 3 and the proposed levy nuclear station (levy). see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, "regulatory matters," for additional information;
•   a $42 million decrease in property and other taxes primarily due to the termination of the collection of the north carolina gross receipts tax as mentioned above; partially offset by a sales tax reserve as a result of an indiana sales tax audit, and higher property taxes; and
•   a $22 million decrease due to the 2013 impairment resulting from the decision to suspend the application for two proposed nuclear units at shearon harris nuclear station (harris).
other income and expenses, net. the variance is primarily due to recognition of post in-service equity returns for projects that had been completed prior to being reflected in customer rates, partially offset by lower afudc - equity, primarily due to placing the sutton plant into service in late 2013.
interest expense. the variance was primarily due to no longer recording post in-service debt returns on projects now reflected in customer rates and a reduction in debt return on the crystal river 3 regulatory asset now recovered through fuel revenues.
income tax expense. the variance was primarily due to higher pretax income and partially offset by a lower effective tax rate of 36.8 percent compared to 37.8 percent, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. the decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to favorable audit settlements, a higher manufacturing deduction due to prior year limitations based on taxable income, and changes in income apportionment for state income tax, partially offset by the non-deductible litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the dan river coal ash spill.
year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to 2012
regulated utilities' results were positively impacted by 2012 impairment and other charges related to the edwardsport integrated gasification combined cycle (igcc) plant, higher retail pricing and rate riders, the inclusion of progress energy results for the first six months of 2013, a net increase in wholesale power revenues, and higher weather-normal sales volumes. these impacts were partially offset by higher income tax expense, crystal river unit 3 charges, lower afudc - equity and higher depreciation and amortization expense. the following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
operating revenues. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $4,339 million increase due to the inclusion of progress energy for the first six months of 2013,
•   a $434 million net increase in retail pricing primarily due to revised rates approved in all jurisdictions;
•   a $76 million net increase in wholesale power revenues, net of sharing, primarily due to additional volumes and charges for capacity for customers served under long-term contracts; and
•   a $72 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers (net of fuel revenue) reflecting increased demand.
partially offset by:
•   a $132 million decrease in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) driven primarily by (i) the impact of lower florida residential fuel rates, including amortization associated with the settlement agreement approved by the florida public service commission (fpsc) in 2012 (2012 settlement), (ii) lower fuel rates for electric retail customers in the carolinas, florida and ohio, and (iii) lower revenues for purchased power, partially offset by (iv) increased demand from electric retail customers. fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers.
operating expenses. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $3,393 million increase due to the inclusion of progress energy for the first six months of 2013,
•   a $346 million increase in impairment and other charges in 2013 primarily related to crystal river unit 3 and levy, and
40
part ii
•   a $102 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to a decrease in the reduction of the cost of removal component of amortization expense as allowed under the 2012 settlement.
partially offset by:
•   a $600 million decrease due to 2012 impairment and other charges related to the edwardsport igcc plant. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, "regulatory matters," for additional information, and
•   a $120 million decrease in fuel expense (including purchased power and natural gas purchases for resale) primarily related to (i) the application of the neil settlement proceeds in florida, including amortization associated with the 2012 settlement; (ii) lower purchased power costs in (a) the carolinas, primarily due to additional generating capacity placed in service in late 2012 and market conditions, (b) ohio, primarily due to reduced sales volumes, and (c) indiana, reflective of market conditions; partially offset by (iii) higher volumes of natural gas used in electric generation due primarily to additional generating capacity placed in service; (iv) higher prices for natural gas and coal used in electric generation; and (v) higher volumes of coal used in electric generation primarily due to generation mix.
other income and expenses, net. the decrease is primarily due to lower afudc equity, resulting from major projects that were placed into service in late 2012 and the implementation of new customer rates related to the igcc rider, partially offset by the inclusion of progress energy for the first six months of 2013.
interest expense. the variance was primarily driven by the inclusion of progress energy for the first six months of 2013.
income tax expense. the variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 were 37.8 percent and 35 percent, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in pretax income and a reduction in afudc equity.
matters impacting future regulated utilities results on february 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at the retired dan river steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the dan river. on february 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe, stopping the release of materials into the river. duke energy is a party to multiple lawsuits filed in regards to the dan river coal ash release and operations at other north carolina facilities with ash basins. the outcome of these lawsuits could have an adverse impact to regulated utilities' financial position, results of operations and cash flows. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies," for additional information.
an order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash basins could have an adverse impact to the regulated utilities' financial position, results of operations and cash flows. see notes 5 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies" and "asset retirement obligations," respectively, for additional information.
in 2015, the indiana utility regulatory commission (iurc) is examining intervenors' allegations that the edwardsport igcc was not properly placed in commercial operation in june 2013 and intervenors' allegations regarding plant performance. in addition, the indiana court of appeals remanded the iurc order in the ninth igcc rider proceeding back to the iurc for further findings concerning approximately $61 million of financing charges joint intervenors claimed were caused by construction delay and a ratemaking issue concerning the in-service date determination for tax purposes. the outcome of these proceedings could have an adverse impact to regulated utilities' financial position, results of operations and cash flows. duke energy cannot predict on the outcome of these proceedings. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, "regulatory matters," for additional information.

international energy's results were negatively impacted by higher tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate historical undistributed foreign earnings, unfavorable hydrology and exchange rates in brazil and an unplanned outage in chile, partially offset by higher equity earnings in national methanol company (nmc) and a 2013 net currency remeasurement loss in latin america. the following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
operating revenues. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $44 million decrease in peru as a result of lower sales volumes and unfavorable exchange rates;
•   a $35 million decrease in brazil due to unfavorable exchange rates and lower sales volumes partially offset by higher average prices;
•   a $27 million decrease in chile as a result of lower sales volumes due to an unplanned outage, and lower average prices; and
•   a $25 million decrease in argentina due to unfavorable exchange rates and lower average prices.
operating expenses. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $75 million increase in brazil due to higher purchased power as a result of unfavorable hydrology, partially offset by favorable exchange rates.
partially offset by:
•   a $38 million decrease in peru as a result of lower purchased power, transmission, and royalty costs; and
•   a $26 million decrease in argentina due to favorable exchange rates and lower purchased power and fuel consumption.
other income and expenses, net. the variance is primarily due to a 2013 net currency remeasurement loss in latin america, higher interest income in brazil, and higher equity earnings in nmc as a result of increased methyl tertiary butyl ether (mtbe) and methanol sales volumes, partially offset by lower average prices and higher butane costs.
income tax expense. the variance was primarily due to approximately $373 million of incremental tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate all cumulative historical undistributed foreign earnings at that time. the effective tax rate for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 87.3 percent and 28.3 percent, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate was also primarily due to the tax expense associated with the repatriation decision.
year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to 2012
international energy's results were negatively impacted by an extended outage at nmc and unfavorable exchange rates in latin america, partially offset by the acquisition of iberoamericana de energía ibener, s.a. (ibener) in 2012 and higher average prices and lower purchased power costs in brazil. the following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
42
part ii operating revenues. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $67 million decrease in brazil due to weakening of the real to the u.s. dollar,
•   a $53 million decrease in central america due to lower average prices and volumes, and
•   an $18 million decrease in argentina as a result of unfavorable exchange rates.
partially offset by:
•   a $67 million increase in brazil due to higher average prices, net of lower volumes, and
•   a $65 million increase in chile as a result of asset acquisitions in 2012.
operating expenses. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $65 million decrease in central america due to lower fuel costs, partially offset by higher purchased power and coal consumption, and
•   a $20 million decrease in brazil due to weakening of the real to the u.s. dollar and lower purchased power partially offset by higher variable costs.
partially offset by:
•   a $36 million increase in chile as a result of acquisitions in 2012.
other income and expenses, net. the decrease was primarily driven by a net currency remeasurement loss in latin america due to strengthening of the dollar, and lower equity earnings at nmc as a result of lower mtbe average prices and lower volumes due to extended maintenance, partially offset by lower butane costs.
interest expense. the variance was primarily due to the chile acquisitions in 2012, partially offset by favorable exchange rates and lower inflation in brazil.
income tax expense. the variance was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 were 28.3 percent and 24.8 percent, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in countries with higher tax rates.
matters impacting future international energy results international energy's operations include conventional hydroelectric power generation facilities located in brazil where water reservoirs are currently at abnormally low levels due to a lack of rainfall.  in addition, international energy's equity earnings from nmc reflect sales of methanol and mtbes, which generates margins that are directionally correlated with crude oil prices. international energy's earnings and future cash flows could be adversely impacted by either a sustained period of low reservoir levels, especially if the government of brazil were to implement rationing or some other mandatory conservation program, or a significant decrease in crude oil prices.

commercial power's results were impacted by higher production tax credits generation, higher production and lower operating costs by the renewables business and a prior-year loss recognized on certain renewables projects, partially offset by an impairment recorded for an intangible asset. the following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
operating revenues. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   an $8 million decrease in electric revenues for the beckjord station, which is not included in the disposal group, driven from lower production as units have been retired;
•   a $7 million decrease in net mark-to-market revenues on non-qualifying power hedge contracts.
partially offset by:
•   a $16 million increase in electric revenues from higher production in the renewables portfolio.
operating expenses. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $94 million increase driven by an impairment taken related to ohio valley electric corporation (ovec). see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, "goodwill and intangible assets" for additional information.
partially offset by:
•   an $18 million decrease in depreciation driven by discontinued amortization of an intangible asset that was impaired and written off in 2014 and extensions on the projected useful lives of assets in the renewable portfolio;
•   a $17 million decrease in fuel expense for the beckjord station driven by lower cost of coal from decreased production as units have been retired;
•   a $16 million decrease related to a 2013 legal settlement reserve related to previously disposed businesses;
•   a $10 million decrease in general and administrative costs;
•   a $9 million decrease in operations and maintenance expense for the renewables portfolio driven primarily by development cost reductions; and
•   a $6 million decrease in property tax expense driven by cost reductions in the renewables portfolio resulting from a property tax abatement that went into effect in the current year.
losses on sales of other assets and other, net. the variance is attributable to a loss recognized on the sale of certain renewable development projects in 2013.
other income and expense. the variance was primarily due to a net gain recognized for the sale of certain renewable development assets and increased equity earnings from higher production in the renewable wind portfolio.
income tax benefit. the variance was primarily due to changes in state deferred taxes and higher production tax credits in 2014 for the renewables portfolio. the effective tax rate for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 75.5 percent and 62.8 percent, respectively.
44
part ii year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to 2012
commercial power's results were negatively impacted by the sale of non-core business operations and lower income from the renewables portfolio and beckjord generating station. these impacts are partially offset by higher income tax benefits. the following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
operating revenues. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   an $81 million decrease due primarily to the sale of non-core businesses in 2012; and
•   a $35 million decrease in electric revenues for the beckjord station driven from lower production as units were prepared for retirement;
partially offset by:
•   a $67 million increase due to higher volumes in the renewables portfolio.
operating expenses. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $34 million increase in operations and maintenance expense for the renewables portfolio driven primarily by commercial operation of certain assets and costs to run the renewables services company acquired in 2012;
•   a $25 million increase in depreciation driven by renewable portfolio assets put in service;
•   a $17 million increase related to midcontinent independent system operator, inc. (miso) and pjm transmission system enhancement obligations; and
•   a $16 million increase related to a 2013 legal settlement reserve related to previously disposed businesses.
partially offset by:
•   a $56 million decrease due primarily to the sale of non-core businesses in 2012;
•   a $17 million decrease in general and administrative costs; and
•   a $16 million decrease in fuel expense for the beckjord station, which is not included in the disposal group, driven by lower cost of coal from decreased production as units were prepared for retirement;
(losses) gains on sales of other assets and other, net. the variance is attributable to a loss recognized on the sale of certain renewable development projects in 2013 and a gain on the 2012 contribution of certain renewable assets to a joint venture.
other income and expense, net. the variance is primarily due to the sale of non-core businesses in 2012, lower equity earnings from the renewables portfolio, and lower interest income.
income tax benefit. the variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax loss and a decrease in manufacturing deductions combined with higher production tax credits in 2013. the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 were 62.8 percent and 58.4 percent, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate for the period was primarily due to higher production tax credits in 2013 for the renewable portfolio.

other's results were negatively impacted by a decrease in income tax benefit. the following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
operating revenues. the decrease was primarily due to mark-to-market activity of mitigation sales related to the progress energy merger.
45
part ii operating expenses. the decrease was primarily due to lower charges related to the progress energy merger and prior year crescent resources llc (crescent) litigation reserve, partially offset by unfavorable loss experience at bison.
other income and expenses. the decrease was primarily due to a gain on the sale of duke energy's 50 percent ownership in dukenet communications holdings, llc (dukenet) in 2013, partially offset by a current year investment sale gain and higher investment income at bison insurance company limited (bison).
interest expense. the variance was due primarily to lower interest on long-term debt resulting from debt maturities and new debt issued at lower rates.
income tax benefit. the variance was primarily due to a state tax benefit recognized in 2013. the effective tax rate for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 41.9 percent and 58.6 percent, respectively.
year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to 2012
other's results were positively impacted by lower charges related to the progress energy merger, the sale of dukenet, and increased current year activity from mitigation sales related to the progress energy merger. these impacts were partially offset by increased interest expense, lower income tax benefit and the crescent litigation reserve in 2013. the following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
operating revenues. the variance was driven primarily by increased activity from mitigation sales related to the progress energy merger and higher premiums earned at bison as a result of the addition of progress energy.
operating expenses. the variance was driven primarily by lower charges related to the progress energy merger, and prior year donations, partially offset by the crescent litigation reserve in 2013 and unfavorable loss experience at bison as a result of the addition of progress energy.
other income and expense, net. the variance was driven primarily by a gain on the sale of duke energy's 50 percent ownership in dukenet in 2013.
interest expense. the variance was due primarily to the inclusion of progress energy for the first six months of 2013 and additional debt issuances.
income tax benefit. the variance was primarily due to a decrease in pretax loss. the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 were 58.6 percent and 42.5 percent, respectively.
matters impacting future other results duke energy previously held an effective 50 percent interest in crescent resources, llc (crescent). crescent was a real estate joint venture formed by duke energy in 2006 that filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in june 2009. on june 9, 2010, crescent restructured and emerged from bankruptcy and duke energy forfeited its entire 50 percent ownership interest to crescent debt holders. this forfeiture caused duke energy to recognize a loss, for tax purposes, on its interest in the second quarter of 2010. although crescent has reorganized and emerged from bankruptcy with creditors owning all crescent interest, there remains uncertainty as to the tax treatment associated with the restructuring. based on this uncertainty, it is possible that duke energy could incur a future tax liability related to the tax losses associated with its partnership interest in crescent and the resolution of issues associated with crescent's emergence from bankruptcy.
in 2013, a ferc administrative law judge issued an initial decision holding that duke energy is responsible for costs associated with multi value projects (mvp), a type of transmission expansion planning (mtep) cost, approved by miso prior to the date of duke energy's withdrawal. the initial decision will be reviewed by ferc. if ferc upholds the initial decision, duke energy intends to file an appeal in federal court. if duke energy is deemed responsible for these costs, and if a portion of these costs are not eligible for recovery, there may be an adverse impact to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, "regulatory matters," for additional information.
income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax discontinued operations decreased $662 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a $929 million pretax write-down of the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated fair value of the disposal group, based on the transaction price included in the psa, less estimated costs to sell and a $134 million pretax mark-to-market loss on economic hedges for the disposal group. included in the variance is the $117 million impact of ceasing depreciation on the assets of the disposal group beginning in the second quarter of 2014.
discontinued operations decreased $85 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in pjm capacity revenues related to lower average cleared capacity auction pricing for the disposal group.

year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 2013
operating revenues. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $180 million increase in retail pricing and updated rate riders, which primarily reflects the impact of the 2013 north carolina and south carolina retail rate cases;
•   a $151 million increase in fuel revenues driven primarily by increased demand from retail customers, mainly due to favorable weather conditions. fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers;
•   a $99 million increase in electric sales (net of fuel revenues) to retail customers due to favorable weather conditions. heating degree days in 2014 were 11 percent above normal compared to 5 percent above normal during the same period in 2013 and cooling degree days were 6 percent below normal as compared to 17 percent below normal in 2013;
•   a $19 million increase in wholesale power revenues, net of sharing, primarily due to new customers; and
•   an $18 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers reflecting increased demand.
partially offset by:
•   a $79 million decrease in gross receipts tax revenue due to the nc tax simplification and rate reduction act which terminated the collection of the north carolina gross receipts tax effective july 1, 2014.
operating expenses. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $151 million increase in fuel expense (including purchased power) primarily due to increased retail demand resulting from favorable weather conditions;
•   a $127 million increase in operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to a litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the dan river coal ash spill (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies," for additional information), repairs and remediation expenses associated with the dan river coal ash discharge and other ash basin related assessment costs, higher non-outage costs at generation plants, higher storm costs, higher distribution costs, higher nuclear outage expense including the impacts of nuclear levelization, and higher energy efficiency program costs, partially offset by decreased corporate costs and lower costs associated with the progress energy merger; and
47
part ii
•   an $88 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to higher depreciation as a result of additional plant in service and amortization of certain regulatory assets, partially offset by lower depreciation expense due to reductions for costs of removal in accordance with the 2013 north carolina and south carolina rate case orders.
partially offset by:
•   a $58 million decrease in property and other tax expenses primarily due to lower revenue related taxes driven by the elimination of north carolina gross receipts tax effective july 1, 2014, partially offset by higher property tax expense.
other income and expenses, net. the variance was primarily due to the recognition of post in-service equity returns for projects that had been completed prior to being reflected in customer rates.
interest expense. the variance was primarily due to no longer recording post in-service debt returns on projects now reflected in customer rates, partially offset by lower interest on bonds.
income tax expense. the effective tax rate for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 35.4 percent and 37.8 percent, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to favorable audit settlements, changes in apportionment related to state income tax and the tax benefit related to the manufacturing deduction in 2014 as the prior year deduction was limited by taxable income, partially offset by the non-deductible litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the dan river coal ash spill.
matters impacting future results on february 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at the retired dan river steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the dan river. on february 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe, stopping the release of materials into the river. duke energy is a party to multiple lawsuits filed in regards to the dan river coal ash release and operations at other north carolina facilities with ash basins. the outcome of these lawsuits could have an adverse impact to duke energy carolinas' financial position, results of operations and cash flows. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies," for additional information.
an order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash basins could have an adverse impact to duke energy carolinas' financial position, results of operations and cash flows. see notes 5 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies" and "asset retirement obligations," respectively, for additional information.

operating revenues. the variance was driven primarily by:
48
part ii
•   a $341 million increase in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) driven primarily by increased demand from wholesale and retail customers, partially resulting from favorable weather conditions, and higher fuel rates for wholesale customers reflective of higher fuel costs for duke energy progress; and to a higher fuel rate in the current year related to lower neil insurance reimbursements and accelerated crystal river unit 3 regulatory asset cost recovery in 2014 as allowed by the 2013 settlement for duke energy florida. fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers;
•   a $149 million increase in retail pricing, which primarily reflects the impact of the 2013 north carolina retail rate case in north carolina and the 2014 base rate increase in florida; and
•   a $114 million increase (net of fuel revenue) in gwh sales to retail customers due to favorable weather conditions. for duke energy progress, heating degree days in 2014 were 11 percent above normal compared to 2 percent above normal in 2013 and cooling degree days were 2 percent below normal compared to 13 percent below normal in 2013. for duke energy florida, heating degree days in 2014 were 51 percent higher and cooling degree days were 4 percent lower compared to the same period in 2013
operating expenses. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $344 million increase in fuel expenses (including purchased power). for duke energy florida the increase is due to the application of the neil settlement proceeds in 2013 and higher sales volumes driven by increased demand and higher fuel prices in the current year. for duke energy progress the increase is primarily due to increased sales volumes;
•   a $245 million increase in depreciation and amortization. for duke energy florida the increase is primarily due to a reduction of the cost of removal component of amortization expense in 2013 as allowed under the 2012 settlement, increased environmental cost recovery clause amortization related to prior year under-recovery and nuclear cost recovery clause amortization due to an increase in recoverable nuclear assets in the current year. for duke energy progress the increase is primarily due to higher depreciation as a result of additional plant in service and amortization of certain regulatory assets and a prior year reversal of a portion of cost of removal reserves in accordance with the 2013 ncuc rate case order; and
•   an $88 million increase in operations, maintenance and other expense primarily due to a litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the management of north carolina coal ash basins (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies," for additional information).
partially offset by:
•   a $346 million decrease due to 2013 impairment and other charges at duke energy florida primarily related to crystal river unit 3 and levy; and
•   a $49 million decrease at duke energy progress due to a current year $18 million reduction to a 2012 impairment charge related to the disallowance of transmission project costs, which are a portion of the long-term ferc mitigation and a $22 million prior-year impairment charge resulting from the decision to suspend the application for two proposed nuclear units at the harris nuclear station.
other income and expense, net. the variance was primarily due to lower afudc - equity as a result of assets placed into service, partially offset by post in-service equity returns for projects that had been completed prior to being reflected in customer rates.
income tax expense. the variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. the effective tax rate for the 12 months ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 38.0 percent and 36.2 percent, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a decrease in afudc - equity and the non-deductible litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the management of north carolina coal ash basins.
matters impacting future results on february 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at duke energy carolinas' retired dan river steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the dan river. on february 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe, stopping the release of materials into the river. duke energy is a party to multiple lawsuits filed in regards to the dan river coal ash release and operations at other north carolina facilities with ash basins. the outcome of these lawsuits could have an adverse impact to progress energy's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies," for additional information.
an order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash basins could have an adverse impact to progress energy's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. see notes 5 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies" and "asset retirement obligations," respectively, for additional information.

year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 2013
operating revenues. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $104 million increase in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) driven primarily by increased demand from wholesale and retail customers, partially resulting from favorable weather conditions, and higher fuel rates for wholesale customers reflective of higher fuel costs. fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers;
•   an $82 million increase (net of fuel revenue) in electric sales to retail customers due to favorable weather conditions. heating degree days in 2014 were 11 percent above normal compared to 2 percent above normal in 2013 and cooling degree days were 2 percent below normal compared to 13 percent below normal in 2013; and
•   an $80 million increase in retail pricing, which primarily reflects the impact of the 2013 north carolina retail rate case.
partially offset by:
•   a $60 million decrease in gross receipts tax revenue due to the nc tax simplification and rate reduction act which terminated the collection of the north carolina gross receipts tax effective july 1, 2014; and
•   a $19 million decrease in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers reflecting decreased demand.
operating expenses. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $111 million increase in fuel expenses (including purchased power) primarily due to increased sales volumes;
•   a $113 million increase in operations and maintenance expenses primarily due to a litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the management of north carolina coal ash basins (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies," for additional information), the impacts of amortization on nuclear levelization outage deferrals and higher storm costs, partially offset by prior year donations for low-income customers and job training in accordance with the 2013 ncuc rate case order and lower costs to achieve the merger with duke energy including severance and employee relocation expenses; and
50
part ii
•   a $48 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses primarily due to higher depreciation as a result of additional plant in service and amortization of certain regulatory assets and a prior year reversal of a portion of cost of removal reserves in accordance with the 2013 ncuc rate case order.
partially offset by:
•   a $49 million decrease in property and other tax expenses primarily due to lower revenue related taxes driven by the elimination of north carolina gross receipts tax effective july 1, 2014, partially offset by higher property tax expense; and
•   a $40 million decrease due to a current year $18 million reduction to a 2012 impairment charge related to the disallowance of transmission project costs, which are a portion of the long-term ferc mitigation and a $22 million prior-year impairment charge resulting from the decision to suspend the application for two proposed nuclear units at the harris nuclear station.
interest expense. the variance was primarily due to a new debt issuance, no longer recording post in-service debt returns on projects now reflected in customer rates and lower afudc - debt due to projects placed in service.
income tax expense. the variance was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. the effective tax rate for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 37.9 percent and 36.5 percent, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the non-deductible litigation reserve related to the criminal investigation of the management of north carolina coal ash basins.
matters impacting future results on february 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at duke energy carolinas' retired dan river steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the dan river. on february 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe, stopping the release of materials into the river. duke energy is a party to multiple lawsuits filed in regards to the dan river coal ash release and operations at other north carolina facilities with ash basins. the outcome of these lawsuits could have an adverse impact to duke energy progress' financial position, results of operations and cash flows. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies," for additional information.

part ii year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 2013
operating revenues. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $237 million increase in fuel and capacity revenues primarily due to a higher fuel rate in the current year related to lower neil insurance reimbursements and accelerated crystal river unit 3 regulatory asset cost recovery in 2014 as allowed by the 2013 settlement. fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers;
•   a $69 million net increase in base revenues due primarily to the 2014 base rate increase;
•   a $63 million increase in nuclear cost recovery clause and energy conservation cost recovery clause revenues due to higher recovery rates in the current year;
•   a $32 million increase in electric sales (net of fuel revenue) to retail customers due to favorable weather conditions. heating degree days in 2014 were 51 percent higher and cooling degree days were 4 percent lower compared to the same period in 2013; and
•   a $29 million increase in wholesale power revenues primarily driven by increased capacity rates partially offset by the impact of contracts that expired in 2013.
operating expenses. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $231 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power due to the application of the neil settlement proceeds in 2013 and higher sales volumes driven by increased demand and higher fuel prices in the current year;
•   a $215 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to a reduction of the cost of removal component of amortization expense in 2013 as allowed under the 2012 settlement, increased environmental cost recovery clause amortization related to prior year under-recovery and nuclear cost recovery clause amortization due to an increase in recoverable nuclear assets in the current year; and
•   a $16 million increase in property and other taxes primarily driven by higher revenue-related taxes in 2014 due to the higher revenues.
partially offset by:
•   a $346 million decrease due to 2013 impairment and other charges primarily related to crystal river unit 3 and levy; and
•   a $48 million decrease in operations and maintenance costs primarily due to prior year crystal river unit 3 related settlement matters and lower costs associated with progress energy's merger with duke energy. these costs were partially offset by increased expenses that are recoverable under the energy conservation and environmental cost recovery clauses.
other income and expense, net. the variance is driven by lower afudc return on the levy projects in the current year.
interest expense. the increase is due to a lower debt return in 2014 driven by the crystal river unit 3 regulatory asset impairment in 2013 and accelerated crystal river unit 3 regulatory asset cost recovery in 2014 as allowed by the 2013 settlement.
income tax expense. the variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. the effective tax rate for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 38.9 percent and 39.6 percent, respectively.

operating revenues. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $56 million increase in regulated fuel revenues primarily driven by higher fuel costs and increased sales volumes;
•   a $51 million increase in retail pricing and rate riders primarily due to 2013 rate increases; and
•   a $9 million increase in volumes to retail customers.
partially offset by:
•   an $8 million decrease in electric revenues for the beckjord station driven from lower production as units have been retired; and
•   a $7 million decrease in net mark-to-market revenue on non-qualifying power hedge contracts.
operating expenses. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $94 million impairment taken related to ovec. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, "goodwill and intangible assets" for additional information; and
•   a $64 million increase in regulated fuel expense driven primarily by higher fuel costs and increased volumes.
partially offset by:
•   a $30 million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower corporate governance costs;
•   a $16 million decrease in nonregulated fuel expense for the beckjord station driven by lower cost of coal from decreased production as units have been retired; and
•   an $8 million decrease in property and other taxes driven primarily by an ohio gas excise tax settlement in 2014.

part ii interest expense. the increase was primarily due to higher regulated average debt balances in 2014 compared to 2013 and higher intercompany interest expense related to the funds loaned from cinergy to duke energy commercial asset management, inc. (decam).
income tax expense. the effective tax rate for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 38.9 percent and 39.1 percent, respectively.
discontinued operations, net of tax. the variance was primarily due to the impairment recognized for the nonregulated midwest generation business.
matters impacting future results on february 17, 2014, duke energy ohio announced it had initiated a process to exit its nonregulated midwest generation business. duke energy ohio expects to dispose of the nonregulated midwest generation business in the second quarter of 2015. duke energy ohio recognized a pretax impairment charge of $886 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, which represents the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the business based on the transaction price included in the psa, less estimated costs to sell. the transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2015 and the impairment will be updated, if necessary, based on the final sales price, after any adjustments at closing for working capital and capital expenditures.
in 2013, a ferc administrative law judge issued an initial decision that duke energy ohio is responsible for costs associated with certain mvp costs, a type of mtep cost, approved by miso prior to the date of duke energy ohio's withdrawal. the initial decision will be reviewed by ferc. if ferc upholds the initial decision, duke energy ohio intends to file an appeal in federal court. if duke energy ohio is deemed responsible for these costs, and if a portion of these costs are not eligible for recovery, there may be an adverse impact to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, "regulatory matters," for additional information.

operating revenues. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $138 million increase in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) due to an increase in fuel rates as a result of higher fuel and purchased power costs;
•   an $86 million net increase in rate riders primarily due to updates to the igcc rider; and
•   a $17 million increase in wholesale power revenues primarily due to higher customer rates.
54
part ii operating expenses. the variance was driven primarily by:
•   a $128 million increase in fuel costs primarily driven by higher fuel and purchased power costs;
•   a $71 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily as a result of the edwardsport igcc plant being placed into service in the second quarter of 2013;
•   a $57 million increase in property and other taxes, primarily as a result of amounts recorded related to an indiana sales tax audit; and
•   a $21 million increase in operation and maintenance primarily due to higher operation and maintenance costs, higher outage costs at generation plants, partially offset by decreased corporate costs.
income tax expense. the effective tax rate for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 35.5 percent and 38.4 percent, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in the indiana statutory corporate state income tax rate, a more favorable state tax credit, and a prior period adjustment.
matters impacting future results duke energy indiana is evaluating converting wabash river unit 6 to a natural gas-fired unit or retiring the unit earlier than its current estimated useful life. if duke energy indiana elects early retirement of the unit, recovery of remaining book values and associated carrying costs totaling approximately $40 million could be subject to future regulatory approvals and therefore cannot be assured.
in 2015, the iurc is examining intervenors' allegations that the edwardsport igcc was not properly placed in commercial operation in june 2013 and intervenors' allegations regarding plant performance. in addition, the indiana court of appeals remanded the iurc order in the ninth igcc rider proceeding back to the iurc for further findings concerning approximately $61 million of financing charges joint intervenors claimed were caused by construction delay and a ratemaking issue concerning the in-service date determination for tax purposes. the outcome of these proceedings could have an adverse impact to duke energy indiana's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. duke energy cannot predict on the outcome of these proceedings. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, "regulatory matters," for additional information.
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, judgments, assumptions and estimates that can significantly affect the reported results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. judgments made include the likelihood of success of particular projects, possible legal and regulatory challenges, earnings assumptions on pension and other benefit fund investments and anticipated recovery of costs.
management discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with senior members of management on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the audit committee of the board of directors. management believes the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods.
regulatory accounting a substantial majority of regulated utilities, duke energy's regulated operations, meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment. as a result, duke energy records assets and liabilities that would not be recorded for nonregulated entities. regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds or reduce rates to customers for previous collections or for costs that have yet to be incurred.
management continually assesses whether recorded regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in duke energy's jurisdictions, litigation of rate orders, recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, asset write-offs would be recognized in operating income. additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, recognition of nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of regulatory assets or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets. for further information on regulatory assets and liabilities, see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, "regulatory matters."
as required by regulated operations accounting, significant judgment can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable cost is considered to be an entity specific cost recoverable in future rates and therefore a regulatory asset. significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenues previously recognized are for entity specific costs that are no longer expected to be incurred and are therefore a regulatory liability.
regulatory accounting rules also require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that part of the cost of a plant under construction (or a recently completed plant or an abandoned plant) will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. for example, if a cost cap is set for a plant still under construction, the amount of the disallowance is a result of a judgment as to the ultimate cost of the plant. other disallowances can require judgments on allowed future rate recovery. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, "regulatory matters," for a discussion of disallowances recorded related to the edwardsport igcc plant and the retired crystal river unit 3 nuclear station.
when it becomes probable that regulated generation, transmission or distribution assets will be abandoned, the cost of the asset is removed from plant in service. the value that may be retained as an asset on the balance sheet for the abandoned property is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return. as such, an impairment charge could be offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset if rate recovery is probable. the impairment for a disallowance of costs for regulated plants under construction, recently completed or abandoned is based on discounted cash flows.
55
part ii as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, "acquisitions, dispositions and sales of other assets," duke energy carolinas and duke energy progress recorded disallowance charges in 2012 in order to gain ferc approval of the merger between duke energy and progress energy. in addition to the disallowances, duke energy carolinas and duke energy progress guaranteed total fuel savings to customers in north carolina and south carolina of $687 million over the five years in order to gain ncuc and pscsc approval of the merger between duke energy and progress energy. based on current estimates of future fuel costs, duke energy anticipates that it will meet the guaranteed fuel savings. however, if actual fuel costs are higher than expected, duke energy could record a charge for the unmet guaranteed savings.
goodwill impairment assessments duke energy allocates goodwill to reporting units, which are determined to be an operating segment or one level below based on how the segment is managed. duke energy is required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually and more frequently if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. duke energy performs its annual impairment test as of august 31.
application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment, including determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries. significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, future rates of return expected to result from ongoing rate regulation, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for duke energy's business and the fair value of debt.
estimated future cash flows under the income approach are based to a large extent on duke energy's internal business plan, and adjusted as appropriate for duke energy's views of market participant assumptions. duke energy's internal business plan reflects management's assumptions related to customer usage and attrition based on internal data and economic data obtained from third-party sources, projected commodity pricing data and potential changes in environmental regulations. the business plan assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future, such as the outcome of future rate filings, future approved rates of returns on equity, anticipated earnings/returns related to significant future capital investments, continued recovery of cost of service, the renewal of certain contracts and the future of renewable tax credits. management also makes assumptions regarding operation, maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events. in estimating cash flows, duke energy incorporates expected growth rates, regulatory and economic stability, the ability to renew contracts and other factors, into its revenue and expense forecasts.
one of the most significant assumptions that duke energy utilizes in determining the fair value of its reporting units under the income approach is the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows. management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the weighted average cost of capital (wacc) for each individual reporting unit. the wacc takes into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. a major component of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on 20-year u.s. treasury bonds. in the 2014 impairment tests, duke energy considered implied waccs for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate wacc rates to use in its analysis. as each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations, including factors such as regulation, the wacc for each reporting unit may differ. accordingly, the waccs were adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company specific risk premiums. the discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of august 31, 2014, for each of duke energy's domestic reporting units ranged from 5.3 percent to 6.9 percent.
for duke energy's international operations, a country-specific risk adder based on the average risk premium for each separate country in which international energy operates was added to the base discount rate to reflect the differing risk profiles. this resulted in a discount rate for the august 31, 2014 goodwill impairment test for the international operations of 10.5 percent.
the underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time. subsequent changes, particularly changes in the discount rates, authorized regulated rates of return or growth rates inherent in management's estimates of future cash flows, could result in future impairment charges.
the majority of duke energy's business is in environments that are either fully or partially rate-regulated. in such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales volumes and costs of capital. accordingly, duke energy's regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of significant swings in market or economic conditions. however, changes in discount rates may have a significant impact on the fair value of equity.
as of august 31, 2014, all of the reporting units' estimated fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity by more than 10 percent.
long-lived asset impairment assessments, excluding regulated operations property, plant and equipment, excluding plant held for sale, is stated at the lower of carrying value (historical cost less accumulated depreciation and previously recorded impairments) or fair value, if impaired. duke energy evaluates property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant change in cash flow projections, the determination that it is more likely than not an asset or asset group will be sold) indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. the determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with their carrying value.
performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset. if an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the asset and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. additionally, determining fair value of the asset requires probability weighting future cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. for assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less cost to sell to determine if an impairment loss is required. until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.
when determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has discrete cash flows.

part ii for further information related to the impairment recorded in conjunction with planned sale of duke energy's disposal group to dynegy, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, "acquisition, disposals and sales of other assets,"
accounting for loss contingencies preparation of financial statements and related disclosures require judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events. duke energy is involved in certain legal and environmental matters arising in the normal course of business. estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts and scenarios that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties, such as federal, state and local courts and other regulators. contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time. amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may differ from the actual outcome once the contingency is resolved, which could have a material impact on future results of operations, financial position and cash flows of duke energy.
for further information, see notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "regulatory matters" and "commitments and contingencies."
revenue recognition revenues on sales of electricity and gas are recognized when either the service is provided or the product is delivered. operating revenues include unbilled electric and gas revenues earned when service has been delivered but not billed by the end of the accounting period. unbilled retail revenues are estimated by applying an average revenue per kilowatt-hour (kwh) or per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for all customer classes to the number of estimated kwh or mcf delivered but not billed. unbilled wholesale energy revenues are calculated by applying the contractual rate per megawatt-hour (mwh) to the number of estimated mwh delivered but not yet billed. unbilled wholesale demand revenues are calculated by applying the contractual rate per megawatt (mw) to the mw volume delivered but not yet billed. the amount of unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors, including seasonality, weather, customer usage patterns, customer mix and the average price in effect for customer classes.
pension and other post-retirement benefits the calculation of pension expense, other post-retirement benefit expense and net pension and other post-retirement assets or liabilities require the use of assumptions and election of permissible accounting alternatives. changes in assumptions can result in different expense and reported asset or liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. duke energy believes the most critical assumptions for pension and other post-retirement benefits are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. additionally, the health care cost trend rate assumption is critical to duke energy's estimate of other post-retirement benefits.
duke energy has historically utilized the society of actuaries' (soa) published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension obligation (qualified and non-qualified) and other post-retirement benefit obligation. on october 27, 2014, the soa published updated mortality tables for u.s. plans (rp-2014) and an updated improvement scale, which both reflect improved longevity. based on an evaluation of the mortality experience of duke energy's pension plan participants, the updated soa study of mortality tables and recent additional studies of mortality improvement, duke energy adopted an adjusted version of the soa's new rp-2014 mortality tables with an updated generational improvement scale (bb-2d) previously published by the soa for purposes of measuring its u.s. pension (qualified and non-qualified) and other post-retirement benefit obligations as of december 31, 2014. the change to the mortality assumption increased duke energy's pension obligation (qualified and non-qualified) and other post-retirement benefit obligation by $201 million and $7 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2014.
duke energy elects to amortize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan projected benefit obligation, into net pension or other post-retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of active covered employees. prior service cost or credit, which represents the effect on plan liabilities due to plan amendments, is amortized over the average remaining service period of active covered employees.
duke energy maintains non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans. the plans cover most u.s. employees using a cash balance formula. under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits based upon a percentage of current eligible earnings based on age and years of service and current interest credits. certain employees are covered under plans that use a final average earnings formula.
duke energy provides some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non-contributory basis. certain employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans.
as of december 31, 2014, duke energy assumes pension and other post-retirement plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 6.50 percent. the expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where applicable. equity securities are held for their higher expected returns. debt securities are primarily held to hedge the pension liability. hedge funds, real estate and other global securities are held for diversification. investments within asset classes are to be diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers on investments. in 2013, duke energy adopted a de-risking investment strategy for its pension assets. as the funded status of the plans increase, over time the targeted allocation to return seeking assets will be reduced and the targeted allocation to fixed-income assets will be increased to better manage duke energy's pension liability and reduced funded status volatility. based on the current funded status of the plans, the asset allocation for the duke energy pension plans has been adjusted to 65 percent fixed-income assets and 35 percent return-seeking assets and the asset allocation for the progress energy pension plans has been adjusted to 60 percent fixed-income assets and 40 percent return-seeking assets. duke energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate.
the assets for duke energy's pension and other post-retirement plans are maintained in a master trust. duke energy also invests other post-retirement assets in the duke energy corporation employee benefits trust (veba i). the investment objective of veba i is to achieve sufficient returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for participants. veba i is passively managed.
57
part ii duke energy discounted its future u.s. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a rate of 4.1 percent as of december 31, 2014. discount rates used to measure benefit plan obligations for financial reporting purposes reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. as of december 31, 2014, duke energy determined its discount rate for u.s. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. this approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to match the timing of projected benefit payments. the selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated aa quality or higher. after the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan's projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.
future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in duke energy's pension and post-retirement plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities. duke energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future. the following table presents the approximate effect on duke energy's 2014 pretax pension expense, pretax other post-retirement expense, pension obligation and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 0.25 percent change in rates were to occur.

duke energy's u.s. other post-retirement plan uses a health care trend rate covering both pre- and post-age 65 retired plan participants, which is comprised of a medical care trend rate, which reflects the near- and long-term expectation of increases in medical costs, and a prescription drug trend rate, which reflects the near and long-term expectation of increases in prescription drug costs. as of december 31, 2014, the health care trend rate was 6.75 percent, trending down to 4.75 percent by 2023. the following table presents the approximate effect on duke energy's 2014 pretax other post-retirement expense and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 1 percentage point change in the health care trend rate were to occur.

duke energy expects the sale of the disposal group to dynegy to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2015. the sale price is $2.8 billion in cash subject to adjustments at closing for changes in working capital and capital expenditures. upon closing of the transaction, duke energy intends to execute a balanced recapitalization strategy with the proceeds. the recapitalization is expected to include a combination of an accelerated share repurchase and debt reduction through avoidance of holding company debt issuances in 2015. the ultimate use of proceeds will depend on facts and circumstances at the time of the closing. for further information on the midwest generation exit, refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, "acquisitions, dispositions and sales of other assets."

part ii in december 2014, duke energy declared a taxable dividend of historical foreign earnings in the form of notes payable that will result in the repatriation of approximately $2.7 billion of cash held and expected to be generated by international energy over a period of up to eight years. between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion will be remitted in 2015, with the remaining amount remitted by 2022. the proceeds of the dividend will principally be used to support duke energy's dividend and growth in the domestic business.
the subsidiary registrants generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. the subsidiary registrants, excluding progress energy, support their short-term borrowing needs through participation with duke energy and certain of its other subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. the companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating under this arrangement. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, "debt and credit facilities," for additional discussion of the money pool arrangement.
duke energy and the subsidiary registrants, excluding progress energy, may also use short-term debt, including commercial paper and the money pool, as a bridge to long-term debt financings. the levels of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations. from time to time, duke energy's current liabilities exceed current assets resulting from the use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate due to the seasonality of its business.
credit facilities and registration statements master credit facility summary at december 31, 2014, duke energy had a master credit facility with a capacity of $6 billion. in january 2015, duke energy amended the master credit facility to increase its capacity to $7.5 billion through january 2020. the duke energy registrants, excluding progress energy, each have borrowing capacity under the master credit facility up to specified sublimits for each borrower. duke energy has the unilateral ability at any time to increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits of each borrower, subject to a maximum sublimit for each borrower. the amount available under the master credit facility has been reduced to backstop the issuances of commercial paper, certain letters of credit and variable-rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the duke energy registrants at the option of the holder. the table below includes the current borrowing sublimits and available capacity under the master credit facility.

on february 20, 2015, duke energy carolinas, duke energy progress and duke energy business services llc (debs), a wholly owned subsidiary of duke energy, each entered into a memorandum of plea agreement (plea agreements) in connection with the investigation initiated by the united states department of justice environmental crimes section and the united states attorneys for the eastern district of north carolina, the middle district of north carolina and the western district of north carolina (collectively, the usdoj). under the terms of the plea agreements, duke energy carolinas and duke energy progress are required to each maintain $250 million of available capacity under the master credit facility as security to meet their obligations under the plea agreements, in addition to certain other conditions set out in the plea agreements. the plea agreements are subject to court approval. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies," for additional information.
premiernotes duke energy has an effective registration statement (form s-3) with the securities and exchange commission (sec) to sell up to $3 billion of variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called premiernotes. the form s-3 states that no more than $1.5 billion of the notes will be outstanding at any particular time. the notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the duke energy premiernotes committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. the interest rate payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of the investment. the notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part by duke energy or at the investor's option at any time. the balance as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, was $968 million and $836 million, respectively. the notes are short-term debt obligations and are reflected as notes payable and commercial paper on duke energy's consolidated balance sheets.
shelf registration in september 2013, duke energy filed a form s-3 with the sec. under this form s-3, which is uncapped, the duke energy registrants, excluding progress energy may issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. the registration statement also allows for the issuance of common stock by duke energy.

dividend payments in 2014, duke energy paid quarterly cash dividends for the 88th consecutive year and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future. there is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the board of directors.
the board of directors continues to target a payout ratio of 65 percent to 70 percent, based upon adjusted diluted eps. over the past several years, duke energy's dividend has grown at approximately 2 percent annually, slower than overall adjusted earnings growth. duke energy has now achieved the targeted payout range and believes it has the flexibility to grow the dividend at a pace more consistent with adjusted earnings growth.
60
part ii dividend and other funding restrictions of duke energy subsidiaries as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements "regulatory matters," duke energy's wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to duke energy via dividend, advance or loan as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with merger transactions. duke energy progress and duke energy florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and articles of incorporation which, in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock. additionally, certain other duke energy subsidiaries have other restrictions, such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to duke energy. at december 31, 2014, the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of duke energy that may not be distributed to duke energy in the form of a loan or dividend is less than 25 percent of duke energy's net assets. duke energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to duke energy, management does not believe these restrictions will have a significant impact on duke energy's ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations.
cash flows from operating activities the relatively stable operating cash flows of regulated utilities compose a substantial portion of duke energy's cash flows from operations. regulated utilities' cash flows from operations are primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas and costs of operations. weather conditions, working capital and commodity price fluctuations, and unanticipated expenses, including unplanned plant outages and storms can affect the timing and level of cash flows from operations.
duke energy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the commercial paper markets, and ultimately, the master credit facility, to support these operations. cash flows from operations are subject to a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic trends and market volatility (see item 1a, "risk factors," for additional information).
at december 31, 2014, duke energy had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.0 billion, of which approximately $1.7 billion is held by entities domiciled in foreign jurisdictions. during 2014, duke energy declared a taxable dividend of historical foreign earnings in the form of notes payable that will result in the repatriation of approximately $2.7 billion of cash held and expected to be generated by international energy over a period of up to eight years. as a result of the decision to repatriate all cumulative historic undistributed foreign earnings, during the fourth quarter of 2014, duke energy recorded u. s. income tax expense of approximately $373 million. duke energy's intention is to indefinitely reinvest prospective undistributed earnings generated by duke energy's foreign subsidiaries. see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, "income taxes," for additional information.
debt issuances depending on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of the issuing entity, and market conditions, the subsidiary registrants prefer to issue first mortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. this preference is the result of generally higher credit ratings for first mortgage bonds and secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. duke energy corporation primarily issues unsecured debt.
duke energy's capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below. the 2015 projected capitalization percentages exclude purchase accounting adjustments of approximately $2.9 billion related to the merger with progress energy, while the 2014 and 2013 percentages include all debt-related purchase accounting amounts.
projected 2015           actual 2014           actual 2013
equity               50   %                49   %                50   %
debt                 50   %                51   %                50   %
duke energy's fixed charges coverage ratio, calculated using sec guidelines, was 3.2 times for 2014, 3.0 times for 2013, and 2.4 times for 2012.
restrictive debt covenants duke energy's debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. the master credit facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 65 percent for each borrower. failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements or sublimits thereto. as of december 31, 2014, duke energy was in compliance with all covenants related to its significant debt agreements. in addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. none of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses.

credit ratings are intended to provide credit lenders a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold. the duke energy registrants' credit ratings are dependent on the rating agencies' assessments of their ability to meet their debt principal and interest obligations when they come due. if, as a result of market conditions or other factors, the duke energy registrants are unable to maintain current balance sheet strength, or if earnings and cash flow outlook materially deteriorates, credit ratings could be negatively impacted.

*   a $917 million decrease in operating cash flows from increased investments in traditional working capital, mainly due to the timing of receivables and accruals, lower incentive accruals, net of current year payments and reserve reductions and the prior year overallocation of the carolinas' fuels costs. these decreases were partially offset by the neil proceeds.

*   a $355 million increase in proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities, net of purchases due to the investment of excess cash held in foreign jurisdictions and
*   a $351 million decrease in capital, investment and acquisition expenditures primarily due to lower spending on duke energy's renewable energy projects and ongoing infrastructure modernization program as these projects were completed, net of expenditures on progress energy's maintenance projects.

part ii for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013, the variance was driven primarily by:
*   a $1,595 million increase in proceeds from net issuances of notes payable and commercial paper, primarily due to funding a larger proportion of total financing needs with short-term debt in anticipation of the receipt in 2015 of proceeds from the sale of the midwest generation business, the proceeds from which will partially be used for debt reduction, partially offset by;
*   a $963 million decrease in net issuances of long-term debt, primarily due to funding a larger proportion of total financing needs with short-term debt in 2014 than in 2013.
for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012, the variance was driven primarily by:
*   an $832 million decrease in net issuances of long-term debt, primarily due to the timing of issuances and redemptions between years, resulting from the completion of major construction projects,
*   a $436 million increase in quarterly dividends primarily due to an increase in common shares outstanding, resulting from the merger with progress energy and an increase in dividends per share from $0.765 to $0.78 in the third quarter of 2013. the total annual dividend per share was $3.09 in 2013 compared to $3.03 in 2012 and
*   a $185 million decrease in proceeds from net issuances of notes payable and commercial paper, primarily due to changes in short-term working capital needs.

off-balance sheet arrangements duke energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. these arrangements include performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications.
most of the guarantee arrangements entered into by duke energy enhance the credit standing of certain subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. as such, these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not always included on the consolidated balance sheets. the possibility of duke energy, either on its own or on behalf of spectra energy capital, llc (spectra capital) through indemnification agreements entered into as part of the january 2, 2007 spin-off of spectra energy corp (spectra energy), having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events.
duke energy performs ongoing assessments of their respective guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of potential increased non-performance risk by third parties for which duke energy has issued guarantees.
see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, "guarantees and indemnifications," for further details of the guarantee arrangements.
issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of duke energy's operations. thus, if duke energy discontinued issuing these guarantees, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
65
part ii other than the guarantee arrangements discussed above and normal operating lease arrangements, duke energy does not have any material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures. for additional information on these commitments, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies."
contractual obligations duke energy enters into contracts that require payment of cash at certain specified periods, based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices. the following table summarizes duke energy's contractual cash obligations as of december 31, 2014.

(a)   see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, "debt and credit facilities."
(b)   interest payments on variable rate debt instruments were calculated using december 31, 2014 interest rates and holding them constant for the life of the instruments.
(c)   see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies." amounts in the table above include the interest component of capital leases based on the interest rates stated in the lease agreements and exclude certain related executory costs.
(d)   current liabilities, except for current maturities of long-term debt, and purchase obligations reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, have been excluded from the above table.
(e)   includes firm capacity payments that provide duke energy with uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity and natural gas transportation contracts, as well as undesignated contracts and contracts that qualify as normal purchase/normal sale (npns). for contracts where the price paid is based on an index, the amount is based on market prices at december 31, 2014, or the best projections of the index. for certain of these amounts, duke energy may settle on a net cash basis since duke energy has entered into payment netting arrangements with counterparties that permit duke energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties.
(f)   includes contracts for software, telephone, data and consulting or advisory services. amount also includes contractual obligations for engineering, procurement and construction costs for new generation plants and nuclear plant refurbishments, environmental projects on fossil facilities, major maintenance of certain nonregulated plants, maintenance and day to day contract work at certain wind facilities and commitments to buy wind and combustion turbines. amount excludes certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand, for which the timing of the purchase cannot be determined.
(g)   related to future annual funding obligations to nuclear decommissioning trust fund (ndtf) through nuclear power stations' re-licensing dates. amounts through 2017 include north carolina jurisdictional amounts that duke energy progress retained internally and is transitioning to its external decommissioning funds per a 2008 ncuc order. the transition of the original $131 million must be complete by december 31, 2017, and at least 10 percent must be transitioned each year. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, "asset retirement obligations."
(h)   uncertain tax positions of $213 million are not reflected in this table as duke energy cannot predict when open income tax years will close with completed examinations. see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, "income taxes."
(i)   the table above excludes reserves for litigation, environmental remediation, asbestos-related injuries and damages claims and self-insurance claims (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies") because duke energy is uncertain as to the timing and amount of cash payments that will be required. additionally, the table above excludes annual insurance premiums that are necessary to operate the business, including nuclear insurance (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies"), funding of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans (see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, "employee benefit plans"), asset retirement obligations, including ash management expenditures (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, "asset retirement obligations") and regulatory liabilities (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, "regulatory matters") because the amount and timing of the cash payments are uncertain. also excluded are deferred income taxes and investment tax credits recorded on the consolidated balance sheets since cash payments for income taxes are determined based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year.
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management policies duke energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. duke energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. duke energy's chief executive officer and chief financial officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. the finance and risk management committee of the board of directors receives periodic updates from the chief risk officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures, and overall risk management activities. the chief risk officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.
66
part ii the following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. please review item 1a, "risk factors," and "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking information" for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein.
commodity price risk duke energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets. duke energy's exposure to these fluctuations is limited by the cost-based regulation of its operations in its regulated utilities segment as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various cost-recovery clauses, including fuel clauses. while there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations.
price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. duke energy's exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including contract size, length, market liquidity, location and unique or specific contract terms. duke energy employs established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations, which may include using various commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. for additional information, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, "derivatives and hedging."
validation of a contract's fair value is performed by an internal group separate from duke energy's deal origination function. while duke energy uses common industry practices to develop its valuation techniques, changes in its pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition.
hedging strategies duke energy closely monitors risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas forward contracts to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. these instruments are also used to optimize the value of the nonregulated generation portfolio. duke energy's primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against exposure to the prices of power and fuel.
the majority of instruments used to manage duke energy's commodity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. these instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. mark-to-market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. undesignated contracts entered into by unregulated businesses are marked-to-market each period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings.
duke energy may also enter into other contracts that qualify for the npns exception. when a contract meets the criteria to qualify as an npns, duke energy applies such exception. income recognition and realization related to npns contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. for contracts qualifying for the npns exception, no recognition of the contract's fair value in the consolidated financial statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring.
generation portfolio risks duke energy is primarily exposed to market price fluctuations of wholesale power, natural gas, and coal prices in the regulated utilities segment. the duke energy registrants optimize the value of their wholesale and nonregulated generation portfolios. the portfolios include generation assets, fuel, and emission allowances. modeled forecasts of future generation output and fuel requirements are based on forward power and fuel markets. the component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategies of the business units.
for the regulated utilities segment, the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations. however, the impact on the consolidated statements of operations is partially offset by mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers.
international energy and commercial power generally hedge their expected generation using long-term bilateral power sales contracts when favorable market conditions exist and are subject to wholesale commodity price risks for electricity not sold under such contracts. international energy dispatches electricity not sold under long-term bilateral contracts into unregulated markets and receives wholesale energy margins and capacity revenues from national system operators. derivative contracts executed to manage generation portfolio risks for delivery periods beyond 2015 are also exposed to changes in fair value due to market price fluctuations of wholesale power, fuel oil and coal.
see "sensitivity analysis for generation portfolio and derivative price risks" below, for more information regarding the effect of changes in commodity prices on duke energy's net income.
67
part ii sensitivity analysis for generation portfolio and derivative price risks the table below summarizes the estimated effect of commodity price changes on duke energy's pretax net income, based on a sensitivity analysis performed for the nonregulated generation portfolio. forecasted exposure to commodity price risk for the regulated utilities segment is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on duke energy's results of operations in 2015. the following commodity price sensitivity calculations consider existing hedge positions and estimated production levels, as indicated in the table below, but do not consider other potential effects that might result from such changes in commodity prices.

(a)    amounts related to forward wholesale prices represent the potential impact of commodity price changes on forecasted economic generation which has not been contracted or hedged. amounts related to forward coal prices and forward gas prices represent the potential impact of commodity price changes on fuel needed to achieve such economic generation. amounts exclude the impact of mark-to-market changes on undesignated contracts relating to periods in excess of one year from the respective date.
(b)   amounts represent sensitivities related to derivative contracts executed to manage generation portfolio risks for periods beyond 2014. amounts exclude the potential impact of commodity price changes on forecasted economic generation and fuel needed to achieve such forecasted generation.
interest rate risk duke energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. duke energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. duke energy also enters into financial derivative instruments, which may include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and u.s. treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. see notes 1, 6, 14, and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, "summary of significant accounting policies," "debt and credit facilities," "derivatives and hedging," and "fair value measurements."
at december 31, 2014, duke energy had $250 million notional amount of fixed-to-floating swaps outstanding and no pre-issuance hedges outstanding. in the first quarter of 2015, duke energy entered into an additional $250 million notional amount of fixed-to-floating swaps. duke energy had $6.9 billion of unhedged long- and short-term floating interest rate exposure at december 31, 2014. the impact of a 100 basis point change in interest rates on pretax income is approximately $72 million at december 31, 2014.
this amount was estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges as of december 31, 2014.
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that the duke energy registrants would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. to reduce credit exposure, the duke energy registrants seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit them to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. the duke energy registrants attempt to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable obtaining collateral or terminating or resetting the terms of transactions after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit-related events. the duke energy registrants may, at times, use credit derivatives or other structures and techniques to provide for third-party credit enhancement of their counterparties' obligations. the duke energy registrants also obtain cash or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, "derivatives and hedging," for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments.
the duke energy registrants' industry has historically operated under negotiated credit lines for physical delivery contracts. the duke energy registrants frequently use master collateral agreements to mitigate certain credit exposures. the collateral agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. the threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the duke energy registrants' internal corporate credit practices and standards. collateral agreements generally also provide that the inability to post collateral is sufficient cause to terminate contracts and liquidate all positions.
the duke energy registrants' principal customers for its electric and gas businesses are commodity clearinghouses, regional transmission organizations, industrial, commercial and residential end-users, marketers, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the u.s. and latin america. the duke energy registrants have concentrations of receivables from such entities throughout these regions. these concentrations of customers may affect the duke energy registrants' overall credit risk in that risk factors can negatively impact the credit quality of the entire sector. where exposed to credit risk, the duke energy registrants analyze the counterparties' financial condition prior to entering into an agreement, establish credit limits and monitor the appropriateness of those limits on an ongoing basis.
68
part ii duke energy carolinas has a third-party insurance policy to cover certain losses related to its asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention of $476 million. duke energy carolinas' cumulative payments began to exceed the self-insurance retention on its insurance policy during the second quarter of 2008. future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by the third-party insurance carrier. the insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is $864 million in excess of the self-insured retention. insurance recoveries of $616 million and $649 million related to this policy are classified in the consolidated balance sheets in other within investments and other assets and receivables as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. duke energy carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims. management believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating.
the duke energy registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. where the duke energy registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. where the duke energy registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, "guarantees and indemnifications," for further information on guarantees issued by the duke energy registrants.
the duke energy registrants are also subject to credit risk of their vendors and suppliers in the form of performance risk on contracts including, but not limited to, outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and commodity purchases. the duke energy registrants' credit exposure to such vendors and suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of non-performance.
credit risk associated with the duke energy registrants' service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. the duke energy registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring customers to provide a cash deposit or letter of credit until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction, at which time the deposit is typically refunded. charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the duke energy registrants and are typically recovered through the retail rates. management continually monitors customer charge-offs and payment patterns to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves. duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through crc, a duke energy consolidated variable interest entity. losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of crc and next by the subordinated retained interests held by duke energy ohio, duke energy kentucky and duke energy indiana. see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, "variable interest entities."
based on the duke energy registrants' policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the duke energy registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non-performance by any counterparty.
marketable securities price risk as described further in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, "investments in debt and equity securities," duke energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations. the vast majority of investments in equity securities are within the ndtf and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.
pension plan assets duke energy maintains investments to help fund the costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans. these investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. the equity securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. duke energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held.
a significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require duke energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. additionally, a decline in the fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods, which could adversely affect duke energy's results of operations in those periods.
nuclear decommissioning trust funds as required by the nuclear regulatory commission (nrc), ncuc, pscsc and fpsc, subsidiaries of duke energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. as of december 31, 2014, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. per the nrc, internal revenue code, ncuc, pscsc and fpsc requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. the investments in equity securities are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets. duke energy actively monitors its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target allocation percentages for various asset classes. accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through retail rates; therefore, fluctuations in equity prices do not affect their consolidated statements of operations as changes in the fair value of these investments are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to an order by the ncuc, pscsc and fpsc. earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail rates. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, "asset retirement obligations" for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, "investments in debt and equity securities" for additional information regarding ndtf assets.
69
part ii foreign currency risk duke energy is exposed to foreign currency risk from investments in international businesses owned and operated in foreign countries and from certain commodity-related transactions within domestic operations that are denominated in foreign currencies. to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the u.s. dollar and/or local inflation rates, or investments may be naturally hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency. duke energy may also use foreign currency derivatives, where possible, to manage its risk related to foreign currency fluctuations. to monitor its currency exchange rate risks, duke energy uses sensitivity analysis, which measures the impact of devaluation of the foreign currencies to which it has exposure.

(a)   includes the results of progress energy beginning on july 2, 2012.
midwest generation exit merchant power plants have, in the recent past, delivered volatile returns in the competitive energy markets in the midwest. in ohio, the public utilities commission of ohio (puco) had granted revenue support from regulated retail markets to help stabilize returns during the transition to competitive markets. however, in early 2014, a request for continued revenue support was denied by the puco. this decision made it clear the energy markets in ohio were to be fully unregulated. although the undiscounted cash flows recover the carrying value of the midwest generation assets, the recovery period is over a long period of time, with risks inherent in operating these assets in competitive energy markets and in an ever changing landscape of environmental regulations related to fossil fuel based generation sources. management concluded in early 2014 that the projected risk and earnings profile of these assets was no longer consistent with duke energy's strategy and initiated a plan to sell these assets and realize the fair value over a shorter period while reducing the risk and volatility associated with these assets.
on august 21, 2014, duke energy commercial enterprises, inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of duke energy corporation, and duke energy sam, llc, a wholly owned subsidiary of duke energy ohio, entered into a psa with a subsidiary of dynegy whereby dynegy will acquire duke energy's disposal group for approximately $2.8 billion in cash subject to adjustments at closing for changes in working capital and capital expenditures. the completion of the transaction is conditioned on approval by ferc and the release of certain credit support obligations. the transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2015. for additional information on the midwest generation business disposition see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, "acquisitions, dispositions and sales of other assets."

part ii north carolina ash basins on february 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at duke energy carolinas' retired dan river steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the dan river. on february 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe, stopping the release of materials into the river. duke energy carolinas estimates 30,000 to 39,000 tons of ash and 24 million to 27 million gallons of basin water were released into the river during the incident. for additional information see note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies."
environmental regulations duke energy is subject to international, federal, state, and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, and other environmental matters. the subsidiary registrants are subject to federal, state, and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters. these regulations can be changed from time to time and result in new obligations of the duke energy registrants.
the following sections outline various proposed and recently enacted regulations that may impact the duke energy registrants. the duke energy registrants also expect to incur increased fuel, purchased power, operation and maintenance, and other costs for replacement generation for potential coal-fired power plant retirements as a result of these proposed and final regulations. the actual compliance costs may be materially different from these estimates based on the timing and requirements of the final epa regulations. refer to note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, "regulatory matters," for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the duke energy registrants.
coal ash management act of 2014
on september 20, 2014, the coal ash act became law. the coal ash act (i) establishes a coal ash management commission (coal ash commission) to oversee handling of coal ash within the state; (ii) prohibits construction of new and expansion of existing ash impoundments and use of existing impoundments at retired facilities, effective october 1, 2014; (iii) requires closure of ash impoundments at duke energy progress' asheville and sutton stations and duke energy carolinas' riverbend and dan river stations no later than august 1, 2019; (iv) requires dry disposal of fly ash at active plants not retired by december 31, 2018; (v) requires dry disposal of bottom ash at active plants by december 31, 2019, or retirement of active plants; (vi) requires all remaining ash impoundments in north carolina to be categorized as high-risk, intermediate-risk, or low-risk no later than december 31, 2015 by the north carolina department of environment and natural resources (denr) with the method of closure and timing to be based upon the assigned risk, with closure no later than december 31, 2029; (vii) establishes requirements to deal with groundwater and surface water impacts from impoundments and (viii) enhances the level of regulation for structural fills utilizing coal ash. the coal ash act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines and modification of requirements regarding structural fills and compliance boundaries. provisions of the coal ash act prohibit cost recovery for unlawful discharge of ash basin waters occurring after january 1, 2014. the coal ash act included a moratorium for any ncuc ordered rate changes to effectuate the legislation, which ended january 15, 2015. the coal ash act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of ccr surface impoundments (ash basins or impoundments) to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. in november 2014, duke energy submitted to denr site specific coal ash excavation plans for the four high priority stations required to be closed no later than august 1, 2019. these plans and all associated permits must be approved by denr before any excavation work can begin.
in september 2014, duke energy carolinas executed a consent agreement with the south carolina department of health and environmental control (scdhec) requiring the excavation of an inactive ash basin and ash fill area at the w.s. lee steam station. as part of this agreement, in december 2014, duke energy carolinas filed an ash removal plan and schedule with scdhec.
for further information, refer to note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies."
mercury and air toxics standards the final mercury and air toxics standards (mats) rule, previously referred to as the utility mact rule, was issued on february 16, 2012. the final rule establishes emission limits for hazardous air pollutants from new and existing coal-fired and oil-fired steam electric generating units. the rule requires sources to comply with emission limits by april 16, 2015. under the clean air act (caa), permitting authorities have the discretion to grant up to a one-year compliance extension, on a case-by-case basis, to sources that are unable to complete the installation of emission controls before the compliance deadline. the duke energy registrants have requested and received a number of compliance extensions. strategies to achieve compliance with the final rule will include installation of new air emission control equipment, development of monitoring processes, fuel switching, and acceleration of retirement for some coal-fired electric-generation units. for additional information, refer to note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, "regulatory matters," regarding potential plant retirements.
in april 2014, several petitions for review of the final rule were denied by the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia (d.c. circuit court). on november 25, 2014, the supreme court granted a petition for review based on the issue of whether the epa unreasonably refused to consider costs in determining whether it is appropriate to regulate hazardous air pollutants from coal-fired and oil-fired steam electric generating units. oral arguments are scheduled for march 25, 2015. the duke energy registrants cannot predict the outcome of the supreme court review of the d.c. circuit court decision and are planning for the rule to be implemented as promulgated given the imminent compliance deadline.
clean water act 316(b)
the epa published the final 316(b) cooling water intake structure rule on august 15, 2014, with an effective date of october 14, 2014. the rule applies to 27 of the electric generating facilities the duke energy registrants own and operate depending on unit retirement dates, excluding stations included in the disposal group. the rule allows several options for demonstrating compliance and provides flexibility to the state environmental permitting agencies to make determinations on controls, if any, that will be required for cooling water intake structures. any required intake structure modifications and/or retrofits are expected to be installed in the 2019 to 2022 timeframe. petitions challenging the rule have been filed by several groups. it is unknown at this time when the courts will rule on the petitions.
71
part ii steam electric effluent limitation guidelines on june 7, 2013, the epa proposed steam electric effluent limitations guidelines. the epa is under a revised court order to finalize the rule by september 30, 2015. the epa has proposed eight options for the rule, which vary in stringency and cost. the proposed regulation applies to seven waste streams, including wastewater from air pollution control equipment and ash transport water. most, if not all, of the steam electric generating facilities the duke energy registrants own are likely affected sources. requirements to comply with the final rule may begin as early as late 2018 for some facilities.
estimated cost and impacts of rulemakings the ultimate compliance requirements for currently proposed environmental regulations will not be known until all the rules have been finalized. the duke energy registrants also expect to incur increased fuel, purchased power, operation and maintenance, and other expenses, in addition to costs for replacement generation for potential coal-fired power plant retirements as a result of these regulations. the actual compliance costs incurred may be materially different from these estimates based on the timing and requirements of the final regulations. the duke energy registrants intend to seek rate recovery of appropriate amounts incurred associated with regulated operations in complying with these regulations. refer to note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, "regulatory matters," for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the duke energy registrants.
the following table provides estimated costs, excluding afudc, of new control equipment that may need to be installed on existing power plants, including conversion of plants to dry disposal of bottom ash and fly ash, to comply with the above regulations over the five years ended december 31, 2019. the table excludes amounts related to the disposal group and ash basin closure costs recorded as asset retirement obligations, for additional information refer to note 9 of the condensed consolidated financial statements, "asset retirement obligations." the table also does not include estimated ash basin closure costs to comply with the recently issued epa regulations for the disposal of ccr from power plants.

coal combustion residuals on december 19, 2014, the epa signed the first federal regulation for the disposal of ccr from power plants. the federal regulation classifies ccr as nonhazardous waste under the resource conservation and recovery act. the regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments, structural fills and ccr piles. the rule establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring and protection procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of ccr. in addition to the requirements of the federal ccr regulation, ccr landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be independently regulated by most states. duke energy records an asset retirement obligation when it has a legal obligation to incur retirement costs associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the obligation can be reasonably estimated. once the rule is effective in 2015, additional asset retirement obligation amounts will be recorded at all duke registrants. cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with state utility commissions, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with duke energy's regulated operations. at this time, duke energy is evaluating the ccr regulation and developing cost estimates that will largely be dependent upon compliance alternatives selected to meet requirements of the regulations. for more information, see note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, "commitments and contingencies."
cross-state air pollution rule on august 8, 2011, the final cross-state air pollution rule (csapr) was published in the federal register. the csapr established state-level annual sulfur dioxide (so2) budgets and annual and seasonal nitrogen oxide (nox) budgets that were to take effect on january 1, 2012.
on august 21, 2012, the d.c. circuit court vacated the csapr. the court also directed the epa to continue administering the clean air interstate rule (cair), which required additional reductions in so2 and nox emissions beginning in 2015. on april 29, 2014, the u.s. supreme court (supreme court) reversed the d.c. circuit court's decision, finding that with csapr the epa reasonably interpreted the good neighbor provision of the caa. the case was remanded to the d.c. circuit court for further proceedings consistent with the supreme court's opinion. on october 23, 2014, the d.c. circuit court lifted the csapr stay, which allowed phase 1 of the rule to take effect on january 1, 2015, terminating the cair. where the csapr requirements are constraining, actions to meet the requirements could include purchasing emission allowances, power purchases, curtailing generation and utilizing low sulfur fuel. the csapr will not result in duke energy registrants adding new emission controls.
additional challenges to the csapr filed in 2012, not addressed by the d.c. circuit court decision to vacate the csapr, are still ongoing. oral arguments were held february 25, 2015. the duke energy registrants cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or how the requirements of the csapr may be impacted going forward.
carbon dioxide new source performance standards on january 8, 2014, the epa proposed a rule to establish carbon dioxide (co2) emissions standards for new pulverized coal, igcc, natural gas combined cycle, and simple cycle electric generating units commencing construction on or after that date. based on the proposal, future coal and igcc units will be required to employ carbon capture and storage technology to meet the proposed standard.

part ii in january 2015, the epa announced that it would finalize the rule for new power plants in the summer of 2015. the duke energy registrants do not expect a material impact on their future results of operations or cash flows based on the epa's proposal. the final rule, however, could be significantly different from the proposal.
co2 existing source performance standards and standards for reconstructed and modified units on june 18, 2014, the epa's proposed clean power plan (cpp) for regulating co2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units (egus) was published in the federal register. on the same date the epa proposed carbon pollution standards for reconstructed and modified egus. the comment period ended october 16, 2014 for the reconstructed and modified proposal and december 1, 2014 for the cpp. duke energy submitted comments on both proposals. in january 2015 the epa announced that it would finalize both proposals in the summer of 2015.
once the cpp is finalized, states will be required to develop plans to implement its requirements. the cpp will not directly impose any regulatory requirements on duke energy registrants. state implementation plans will include the regulatory requirements that will apply to duke energy registrants. based on the epa's june 18, 2014 proposal, states will have from one to three years after the cpp is finalized to submit a plan for epa's review. in january 2015 the epa announced that it would also propose a federal implementation plan for public comment in the summer of 2015. a federal plan would be epa's plan for meeting the requirements of the cpp and could take the place of a state plan if a state either fails to submit a plan or submits a plan that is not approved by the epa.
the epa has proposed to phase co2 emission reductions in over the period 2020 to 2030. the final requirements of the cpp, however, including the implementation schedule are uncertain and could be significantly different from the proposal. in addition, it will be several years before the requirements of the subsequent state plans are known. also unknown at this time are the requirements of any federal plan that might be imposed on states in which the duke energy registrants operate should a state fail to submit a plan or have their plan disapproved by the epa. the duke energy registrants are therefore unable to predict the outcome of this rulemaking, or how it might impact them, but the impact could be significant.
global climate change the duke energy registrants' greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions consist primarily of co2 with most coming from their fleet of coal-fired power plants in the u.s. in 2014, the duke energy registrants' u.s. power plants emitted approximately 135 million tons of co2. co2 emissions from duke energy's international operations were approximately 2 million tons. the duke energy registrants' future co2 emissions will be influenced by variables including new regulations, economic conditions that affect electricity demand, and the duke energy registrants' decisions regarding generation technologies deployed to meet customer electricity needs.
the duke energy registrants are taking actions that will result in reduced ghg emissions over time. these actions will lower the duke energy registrants' exposure to any future mandatory ghg emission reduction requirements or carbon tax, whether a result of federal legislation or epa regulation. under any future scenario involving mandatory ghg limitations, the duke energy registrants would plan to seek recovery of compliance costs associated with their regulated operations through appropriate regulatory mechanisms.
the duke energy registrants recognize certain groups associate severe weather events with climate change, and forecast the possibility these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity. however, the uncertain nature of potential changes of extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration, and severity), the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place, and the inability to predict these with any degree of accuracy, make estimating any potential future financial risk to the duke energy registrants' impossible. currently, the duke energy registrants plan and prepare for extreme weather events they experience from time to time, such as ice storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, high winds and droughts.
the duke energy registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on their electric distribution systems. the duke energy registrants' electric generating facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without significant damage. the duke energy registrants maintain an inventory of coal and oil on site to mitigate the effects of any potential short-term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity. the duke energy registrants have a program in place to effectively manage the impact of future droughts on their operations.
nuclear matters following the events at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station in japan, duke energy conducted thorough inspections at each of its seven nuclear sites during 2011. the initial inspections did not identify any significant vulnerabilities, however, duke energy is reviewing designs to evaluate safety margins to external events. emergency-response capabilities, written procedures and engineering specifications were reviewed to verify each site's ability to respond in the unlikely event of station blackout. duke energy is working within the nuclear industry to improve safety standards and margin using the three layers of safety approach used in the u.s.: protection, mitigation and emergency response. emergency equipment is currently being added at each station to perform key safety functions in the event that backup power sources are lost permanently. these improvements are in addition to the numerous layers of safety measures and systems previously in place.
in march 2011, the nrc formed a task force to conduct a comprehensive review of processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should make additional improvements to the nuclear regulatory system. on july 13, 2011, the task force proposed a set of improvements designed to ensure protection, enhance accident mitigation, strengthen emergency preparedness and improve efficiency of nrc programs. the recommendations were further prioritized into three tiers based on the safety enhancement level. on march 12, 2012, the nrc issued three regulatory orders requiring safety enhancements related to mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at a plant, ensuring reliable hardened containment vents and enhancing spent fuel pool instrumentation.
on august 30, 2012, the nrc issued implementation guidance to enable power plants to achieve compliance with the orders issued in march 2012. plants were required to submit implementation plans to the nrc by february 28, 2013, and complete implementation of the safety enhancements within two refueling outages or by december 31, 2016, whichever comes first. each plant is also required to reassess their seismic and flooding hazards using present-day methods and information, conduct inspections to ensure protection against hazards in the current design basis, and re-evaluate emergency communications systems and staffing levels.
73
part ii duke energy is committed to compliance with all safety enhancements ordered by the nrc in connection with the march 12, 2012, regulatory orders noted above, the cost of which could be material. until such time as the nrc-mandated reassessment of flooding and seismic hazards is complete the exact scope and cost of compliance modifications to duke energy's sites will not be known. with the nrc's continuing review of the remaining recommendations, duke energy cannot predict to what extent the nrc will impose additional licensing and safety-related requirements, or the costs of complying with such requirements. upon receipt of additional guidance from the nrc and a collaborative industry review, duke energy will be able to determine an implementation plan and associated costs. see item 1a, "risk factors," for further discussion of applicable risk factors.

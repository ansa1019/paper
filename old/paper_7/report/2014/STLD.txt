operating statement classifications net sales.    net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped, product mix and related pricing. we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel, product dimensions, certain smaller volumes, and for value-added processing or coating of the steel products. except for our steel fabrication operations segment, we recognize revenue from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales at the time the title of the product is transferred to the customer. provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience. net sales from steel fabrication operations are recognized from construction contracts utilizing a percentage-of-completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required for each contract.
costs of goods sold.    our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products. the principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes (which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold), steel, direct and indirect labor and related benefits, alloys, zinc, transportation and freight, repairs and maintenance, utilities (most notably electricity and natural gas), and depreciation.
36
selling, general and administrative expenses.    selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales, finance and accounting, and administrative departments. these costs include, among other items, labor and related benefits, professional services, insurance premiums, property taxes, company-wide profit sharing, and amortization of intangible and other assets.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest.    interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects.
other expense (income), net.    other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash deposits and investments; any other non-operating income activity, including income from non-consolidated investments accounted for under the equity method. other expense consists of any non-operating costs, such as acquisition and certain financing expenses.
2014 overview we are one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking and coating capability of approximately 11 million tons and actual recycling volumes. the primary sources of our revenues are from the manufacture and sale of steel products, processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals, and, to a lesser degree, fabrication and sale of steel joist and decking products. our operations are managed and reported based on three operating segments: steel operations, metals recycling and ferrous resources operations, and steel fabrication operations.
acquisition of severstal columbus, llc. (columbus)
on september 16, 2014, we completed our acquisition of severstal columbus, llc (columbus), on a debt-free basis, for a purchase price of $1.625 billion, with additional working capital adjustments of $44.4 million. the columbus acquisition was funded through the issuance of $1.2 billion of senior notes, borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, and available cash. we purchased columbus to significantly expand and diversify our steel operating base, with the addition of 3.4 million tons of hot roll steel production capacity. the product offerings are diversified with respect to width, gauge, and strength, when compared to the capabilities of our butler flat roll division. located in northeast mississippi, columbus is one of the newest and most technologically advanced sheet steel electric arc furnace mills in north america, with access to non-energy related pipe and tube, oil country tubular goods (octg) and automotive markets. additionally, columbus is advantageously located to serve the growing markets in the southern u.s. and mexico, providing geographic diversification and growth opportunities. columbus'
operating results have been reflected in our financial statements since the effective date of the acquisition, in the steel operations reporting segment. columbus reported revenues of
$638.3 million and pretax income of $56.1 million during the september 16 to december 31, 2014, period, before giving effect to $26.4 million of purchase accounting related cost of goods sold expenses associated with the step-up in inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets, and $25.2 million of acquisition and related costs that are included in other expenses in the consolidated income statement for the year ended december 31, 2014.
minnesota ironmaking operations impairment during the fourth quarter of 2014, our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady operating state, indicating a consistency in the operation's production capability, processes and cost structure, including the ability to utilize certain lower-cost raw materials. given this, we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of our minnesota ironmaking operation's fixed assets. with our current outlook regarding future operating costs and product pricing, we
37
concluded that the carrying value of these fixed assets was no longer fully recoverable, and the fixed assets were in fact impaired. this assessment resulted in a $260.0 million non-cash impairment charge, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, recorded in the metals recycling and ferrous resources operating segment, which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $132.6 million and our diluted earnings per share by $0.55.
consolidated results 2014 vs. 2013
net sales in 2014 of $8.8 billion increased 19% from 2013 net sales of $7.4 billion, due to increased shipments in all of our operating segments, and higher average selling prices in our steel and fabrication operations. we achieved record volumes in our steel and fabrication segments, which reported increased shipments of 19% (4% without columbus) and 31%, respectively, in 2014, as compared to 2013. demand continues to be strong in the automotive and manufacturing markets, the non-residential construction markets continues to improve, and we began to realize sales from our new special-bar-quality small-diameter rolling mill at our engineered bar products division and from our premium rail expansion at our structural and rail division. our metal spreads in steel and fabrication also improved, as market pricing increased to a greater degree than raw materials costs. plant utilization was also strong, which resulted in volume-related cost compression in our steel and fabrications segments. while shipments increased at omnisource, our metals recycling operations, operating income decreased in 2014, when compared to 2013, due to decreases in metal spreads. the impact of losses from our minnesota ironmaking operations on 2014 net income, including the impact of the $260.0 million of non-cash impairment charges, was approximately $165.9 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, as compared to approximately $42 million, or $0.18 per diluted share in 2013. as a result of the above, net income in 2014, including the impact of impairment charges, decreased $32.3 million or 17%, to $157.0 million, or $0.67 per diluted share.
excluding the impact of the $260.0 million in non-cash impairment charges, consolidated operating income increased $193.8 million, or 50%, to $580.3 million in 2014, compared to $386.5 million in 2013, and net income increased $100.3 million, or 53%, to $289.6 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, during 2014, compared with net income of $189.3 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, during 2013. the impact of the $260.0 million non-cash impairment charge related to our minnesota ironmaking operations, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $132.6 million and our diluted earnings per share by $0.55.

net sales for the steel operations segment increased in 2014 by $1.2 billion, or 25%, ($638.3 million, or 13%, of which related to the addition of columbus), compared to 2013, with the segment achieving record shipments of 7.4 million tons in 2014. selling volumes increased for both our sheet products (26%, of which 24% was related to columbus) and long products (12%) in 2014, compared to 2013, and overall product mix shifted somewhat toward sheet products with the acquisition of our columbus flat roll division. our engineered bar products and structural and rail divisions achieved increased shipments of 32% and 12%, respectively. demand for our sheet products remained strong in the automotive and manufacturing markets. customer demand for our special-bar-quality products strengthened from the prior year, and we began selling smaller diameter products produced from our recent expansion project. demand for structural steel products improved with the continued growth in the non-residential construction market and we began to realize sales from our recently completed expansion into premium rail. in addition, despite pressure from increased imports in 2014, our average steel selling prices improved by $35 per ton, or 4%, over those in 2013 on the strength of improved domestic market demand in 2014.
metallic raw materials used in our steel mills' electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost. our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations increased $7 in 2014 compared with 2013. during 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, our metallic raw material costs represented 65%, 65%, and 66% of our steel operations' manufacturing costs, excluding the operations of the techs, which purchases, rather than produces, the steel it further processes.
as a result of record shipments and metal spread expansion (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap), operating income for the steel segment increased 33%, to $671.6 million in 2014, compared to $504.4 million in 2013.
metals recycling and ferrous resources operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations.    this operating segment primarily includes our metals recycling operations (omnisource); our liquid pig iron production facility, iron dynamics (idi); and our minnesota ironmaking operations. our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations segment accounted for 28%, 32%, and 32% of our consolidated net sales in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. segment operating losses before impairment charges decreased $3.7 million in 2014, to $48.7 million, compared to 2013, as reduced losses in the minnesota ironmaking operations were partially offset by reductions in metals recycling operating income.

metals recycling.    omnisource represents our metals sourcing and processing operations and is the primary source of net sales in this segment. these operations sell ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries, and nonferrous metals, such as copper, brass, aluminum and stainless steel to, among others, ingot manufacturers, copper refineries and mills, smelters, and specialty mills. our metals recycling operations represented 87%, 91%, and 94% of this segment's net sales during 2014, 2013, and 2012; and $26.0 million, $41.9 million, and $47.7 million of this segment's operating income for these same periods, respectively.
net sales in metals recycling increased 8% in 2014 as compared to 2013, as nonferrous volumes increased 12% with steady pricing, while ferrous volumes were slightly higher and selling prices increased 2%. operating income for metals recycling decreased $15.9 million, or 38%, in 2014, when compared to 2013, as the decreases in both ferrous and nonferrous metal spreads of 8% and 2%, respectively (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap), more than offset the impact of the increased nonferrous, and to a lesser degree, ferrous shipments.
ferrous resources.    our ferrous resource operations consist of our two ironmaking initiatives: iron dynamics (idi), a liquid pig iron production facility, and our minnesota ironmaking operations, consisting of an iron nugget production facility and operations to supply the nugget facility with its primary raw material, iron concentrate. idi primarily produces liquid pig iron, which is used as a scrap substitute raw material input exclusively at our butler flat roll division. our minnesota ironmaking operations consists of mesabi nugget, (owned 82% by us); our iron concentrate and potential future iron mining operations, mesabi mining; and, our iron tailings operations, mining resources (owned 81% by us). during the fourth quarter of 2014, our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady operating state, indicating a consistency in the operation's production capability, processes and cost structure, including the ability to utilize certain lower-cost raw materials. given this, we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of our minnesota ironmaking operation's fixed assets. with our current outlook regarding future operating costs and product pricing, we concluded that the carrying value of these fixed assets was no longer fully recoverable, and the fixed assets were in
43
fact impaired. this assessment resulted in a $260.0 million non-cash impairment charge, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $132.6 million. the impact of losses from our minnesota ironmaking operations on 2014 net income, including the impact of the $260.0 million of non-cash impairment charges, was approximately $165.9 million. excluding the $260.0 million in non-cash impairment charges, the impact of minnesota ironmaking operations on 2014 net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. was approximately $33.3 million, as compared to approximately $41.9 million in 2013.
in 2014, mining resources experienced higher costs due to reduced iron recovery rates from the tailings basins, prompting the need to install enhanced recovery equipment, which is taking place in the first quarter of 2015. due to this and a temporary excess supply of nugget inventory at our steel mills, we have decided to warm-idle our minnesota ironmaking operations for a period of 6 to 8 weeks beginning in mid-february 2015.
steel fabrication operations steel fabrication operations.    steel fabrication operations consist of our six new millennium building systems plants located throughout the united states and northern mexico. revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses, girders, steel joists and steel decking used within the non-residential construction industry. steel fabrication operations accounted for 7%, 6%, and 5% of our consolidated net sales during 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
steel fabrication operations sales volumes and average selling price net sales for the steel fabrication operations segment increased $192.2 million, or 44%, in 2014, compared to 2013, as shipments increased 31% and average selling prices increased $116 per ton, or 10%, with increased demand. our steel fabrication operations continue to realize strength in order activity and resulting shipments at levels in excess of overall improving consumer demand, as we continue to leverage our national footprint to expand market share.
the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations, generally representing more than two-thirds of the total cost of manufacturing for our steel fabrication operations. the average cost of steel consumed increased in 2014, as compared to 2013, by $47 per ton, consistent with increased pricing in the general relevant steel market.
44
operating income for the steel fabrication segment of $51.9 million in 2014 was over seven times that of 2013, due to record level shipments and metal spread expansion, as well as decreased conversion costs realized from manufacturing efficiencies and from higher production volumes.
consolidated results 2014 vs. 2013
selling, general and administrative expense (sg&a).    selling, general and administrative expenses (including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets) were $385.9 million during 2014, as compared to $332.3 million during 2013, an increase of $53.6 million, or 16%. during 2014 and 2013, these selling, general and administrative expenses represented approximately 4.4% and 4.5% of net sales, respectively. the increase in total sg&a expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 relates most notably to the increased profit sharing, incentive compensation and stock compensation expenses of $35.5 million, which increased due to increased profitability before impairment charges. while total intangible assets increased slightly due to the acquisition of columbus, amortization of intangible assets decreased $4.2 million, or 13%, during 2014 compared to 2013 due to the accelerated amortization methods used for intangible assets related to existing customer and scrap generator relationships.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest.    during 2014, gross interest expense increased $7.4 million, or 6%, to $139.7 million, and capitalized interest decreased $2.1 million, to $2.5 million, as compared to 2013. the decrease in interest capitalized during these periods relates to growth or expansion projects initiated in 2013 at two of our steel mills that were completed in 2014. the increase in gross interest expense is due primarily to the addition of the $1.2 billion senior notes in september 2014, in conjunction with our acquisition of columbus, partially offset by the conversion or payoff at maturity of $287.5 million of 5.125% convertible notes in june 2014.
other (income) expense, net.    other expense increased $22.3 million to $18.3 million during 2014, as compared to other income of $4.0 million during 2013, due primarily to $25.2 million in acquisition and finance costs associated with the acquisition of columbus.
income taxes.    during 2014, our income tax expense was $73.2 million, as compared to $99.3 million during 2013, and our effective income tax rate before exclusion of noncontrolling interests was 44.4% and 37.8%, for 2014 and 2013, respectively. the higher effective income tax rate in 2014 is due primarily to the impact of the increased noncontrolling interest losses, offset somewhat by increased benefits from other permanent tax benefit items, most notably the domestic manufacturing deduction. the 2013 effective tax rate benefited from the effects of additional stock option exercises during 2013, and 2012 research and development tax credits enacted in january 2013.
included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2014, of $17.3 million are potential benefits of $12.5 million that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a net-of-tax basis in income tax expense. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized benefits from the reduction of interest expense of $1.1 million, net of tax. in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, we had $5.5 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31, 2014.
we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions. the internal revenue service (irs) has completed its examinations of the years 2004 through 2009 and has settled those years with us. the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the years 2010 and 2011. at this time we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of these state and federal income tax audits. based on the current audits in process, the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to $8.1 million by the end of 2015. with the exception of the 2010 federal return which is currently under review, we are no longer subject to federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before 2011.

consolidated results 2013 vs. 2012
during 2013, net sales of $7.4 billion and operating income of $386.5 million was relatively unchanged from 2012 net sales of $7.3 billion and operating income of $391.2 million, despite generally higher shipments, as 2013 full year metal margins declined for our steel and metals recycling operations. however, 2013 consolidated pretax income increased $58.8 million, or 29%, reflecting interest cost savings of $30.9 million and a reduction in refinancing costs of $37.7 million, which were associated with our 2012 and early 2013 financing activities. net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. was $189.3 million or $0.83 per diluted share in 2013, compared with $163.6 million, or $0.73 per diluted share in 2012.
in spite of record annual shipments in 2013 in our steel operations, compressed metal margins resulted in a modest 2% increase in steel operations operating income, to $504.4 million, compared to 2012. average 2013 steel prices per ton shipped declined $41 amidst continued pricing pressure, while average ferrous scrap consumed for production only declined $25 per ton. operating income of omnisource, our metals recycling operations decreased 12% to $41.9 million, as 2013 ferrous and nonferrous metals shipments were comparable to 2012; however, both ferrous and nonferrous metal margins decreased slightly during the year. the impact of losses from our minnesota ironmaking operations on 2013 net income was approximately $42 million, or $0.18 per diluted share in each of 2013 and 2012. our steel fabrication operations reported operating income of $7.0 million in 2013, an increase of $4.9 million, or 231%, compared to 2012, experiencing a 24% increase in selling volumes, the result of improved domestic demand for fabricated steel as well as our fabrication operations' gains in market share.
selling, general and administrative expense (sg&a).    selling, general and administrative expenses (including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets) were $332.3 million during 2013, as compared to $320.5 million during 2012, an increase of $11.8 million, or 4%. during 2013 and 2012, selling, general and administrative expenses represented approximately 4.5% and 4.4% of net sales, respectively. the increase in sg&a expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 relates most notably to increased non-cash equity-based compensation expenses of $5.3 million. amortization of intangible assets decreased $3.8 million, or 11%, during 2013 compared to 2012 due to the accelerated amortization methods used for intangible assets related to customer and scrap generator relationships.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest.    during 2013, gross interest expense decreased $27.7 million, or 17%, to $132.3 million, and capitalized interest increased $3.2 million, to $4.6 million, as compared to 2012. the interest capitalized during these periods relates to longer-term construction activities at our various operating segments, which increased in 2013 with our increased expansion plans, as compared to 2012. the decrease in gross interest expense is due to refinancing activities that took place in primarily the second half of 2012 and march 2013. we repaid $175 million of our debt in 2012 and $100 million in 2013. we also refinanced $1.4 billion of senior notes, reducing our overall effective interest rate from almost 7.0% to less than 5.6% at december 31, 2013.
other (income) expense, net.    other income was $4.0 million during 2013, as compared to other expense of $28.5 million during 2012. we recorded non-operating charges of $2.6 million in 2013 related to our 2013 refinancing activities, while we recorded $40.3 million of non-operating charges in 2012 related to our 2012 refinancing activities.
income taxes.    during 2013, our income tax expense was $99.3 million, as compared to $61.8 million during 2012. our effective income tax rate before exclusion of noncontrolling interests was 37.8% and 30.3%, during 2013 and 2012, respectively. the lower effective income tax rate in 2012 is due primarily to the impact of reductions in our unrecognized tax positions due to tax audit settlements in 2012, which reduced our effective tax rate by 9.6%. the 2013 effective tax rate benefitted from the effects of additional stock option exercises during 2013, and 2012 research and development tax credits enacted in january 2013.
46
liquidity and capital resources columbus acquisition.    in september 2014, we issued $700.0 million of 5.125% senior notes due 2021 and $500.0 million of 5.500% senior notes due 2024 (together, the senior notes). the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes, along with cash on hand and $117.8 million in borrowings under our senior secured credit facility were used to fund the september 16, 2014, acquisition of columbus and related expenses.
capital resources and long-term debt.    our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for, among other things, the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws. our short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures, working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness. we have met these liquidity requirements primarily with cash provided by operations, long-term borrowings and availability under our revolver. our liquidity at december 31, 2014, is as follows (in thousands):
cash and equivalents        $361,363
revolver availability               1,185,529
total liquidity             $1,546,892
our total outstanding debt increased $916.6 million during 2014, to $3.0 billion, due to the issuance of $1.2 billion in senior notes used to fund a portion of the columbus acquisition. in june 2014, $287.5 million of our 5.125% convertible senior notes were converted to shares of our common stock or paid with available cash at maturity. as a result of these activities, our total long-term debt to capitalization ratio (representing our long-term debt, including current maturities, divided by the sum of our long-term debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and our total stockholders' equity) increased to 50.9% at december 31, 2014, from 44.7% at december 31, 2013.
in november 2014, we amended, restated and expanded our senior secured revolving credit facility (facility) and entered into a new term loan facility. we expanded our senior secured revolving credit facility from the prior $1.1 billion level to a renewed five year $1.2 billion facility and also entered into a new five-year $250.0 million term loan facility, both of which mature on november 14, 2019. subject to certain conditions, we also have the ability to increase the combined facility size by a minimum of $750 million. the proceeds from the new term loan facility were used to refinance our existing $226.9 million term loan facility and for general corporate purposes.
the facility contains financial and other covenants pertaining to our ability (which may under certain circumstances be limited) to make capital expenditures; incur indebtedness; permit liens on property; enter into transactions with affiliates; make restricted payments or investments; enter into mergers, acquisitions or consolidations; conduct asset sales; pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities. our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants.
the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50:1.00. our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our last-twelve trailing months (ltm) consolidated adjusted proforma ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other non-cash transactions as allowed in our facility) by our ltm proforma gross interest expense, less amortization of financing fees. in addition, a net debt (as defined in the facility) to consolidated ltm adjusted proforma ebitda (net debt leverage ratio) of not more than 5.00:1.00 must be maintained. if the net debt leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1:00 at any time, our ability to make certain payments as defined in the facility (which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases, among other things), is limited. at december 31, 2014, our interest coverage ratio and net debt leverage ratio were 6.05:1.00 and 2.47:1.00, respectively. we were therefore in compliance with
47
these covenants at december 31, 2014, and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months.
working capital.    cash flow from operations of $617.6 million was driven mainly by net income plus non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, and impairment charges. during 2014, our operational working capital position, representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories, less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt, increased $317.5 million to $1.7 billion compared to december 31, 2013. this 23% increase is attributable primarily to the acquisition of columbus and its $354.1 millions of dollars of operational working capital at the date of acquisition. inventories (excluding inventories acquired from columbus) decreased $68.7 million and were offset by corresponding decreases in accounts payable, while accrued expenses, primarily profit sharing and incentive compensation, increased due to higher profitability levels in 2014. high credit quality of accounts receivable has been maintained, and days sales outstanding has remained consistent at approximately 37 days, with over 98% of our accounts receivable being current or less than 60 days past due.
capital investments.    during 2014, we invested $111.8 million in property, plant and equipment (not including the columbus acquisition), as compared to $186.8 million during 2013. capital investments in 2014 were below those of 2013, as growth or expansion projects initiated in early 2013 at two of our steel mills were completed in 2014. we believe these capital investments will benefit our net sales and related cash flows as each project attains appropriate operational metrics. our current estimated 2015 cash allocation plan includes the investment of between $150 million and $175 million in capital expenditures in our existing and announced operations.
cash dividends.    as a reflection of confidence in our current and future strength regarding our cash flow generation ability and financial position, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $0.115 per share in 2014 (from $0.110 per share during 2013), resulting in declared cash dividends of $108.6 million during 2014, compared to $97.4 million during 2013. we paid cash dividends of $105.4 million and $94.8 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively. our board of directors, along with executive management, approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors, after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, outstanding indebtedness, current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans. in addition, the terms of our senior secured credit facility and the indenture relating to our senior notes may restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay.
other.    our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will depend upon general economic, financial and business conditions, along with competition, legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control. in addition, we cannot assure that our operating results, cash flows, access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flows from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including additional borrowings under our revolver through its term, which expires in november 2019, will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, funding working capital requirements, and anticipated capital expenditures.
during 2014 we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately $8.8 million. based on our current abatements and incentive credits, and utilizing our existing long-lived asset structure, we estimate the remaining annual benefit to our future operations to be approximately $22.0 million, $20.0 million, $21.8 million, $13.0 million, and $1.2 million during the years 2015 through 2019, respectively, and $207,000 in total thereafter.
48
contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations, including purchase obligations, as defined by the securities and exchange commission. a "purchase obligation" is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. other long-term liabilities are defined as long-term liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles. based on this definition, the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations. it does not include normal purchases, which are made in the ordinary course of business. the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities as of december 31, 2014 (in thousands):

(6)
we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits; however, due to the uncertainty of the timing, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $22.8 million as of december 31, 2014, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information.
other matters inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations.
environmental and other contingencies we have incurred, and in the future will continue to incur, capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control, remediation, monitoring and compliance. during 2014, we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately $40.3 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately $4.0 million. over 78% of the costs incurred during 2014 for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements. we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately $1.1 million at all of our facilities during 2014. we have an accrual of $1.6 million (net of $600,000 of escrowed funds) recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations and $2.8 million related to minnesota operations. we believe, apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity; however, environmental laws and regulations evolve and change, and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future, such as the impact of u.s. government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u. s. we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts.    except for our steel fabrication operations segment, we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers. provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience. if the historical data used in our estimates does not
50
reflect future returns and claims trends, additional provision may be necessary. the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the company's best estimate of probably credit losses, along with historical experience, which estimates may or may not prove accurate. our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenues from construction contracts using a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to-date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract.
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers, which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors, including the automotive, construction, commercial, transportation, agriculture, industrial machinery, pipe and tube, and energy (including octg) markets. our metals recycling operations sell ferrous scrap to steel mills and foundries, and nonferrous scrap, such as copper, brass, aluminum and stainless steel to, among others, ingot manufacturers, copper refineries and mills, smelters, and specialty mills. our fabrication operations sell fabricated steel joists and deck primarily to the non-residential construction market. we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks, historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers. we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary, such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowance may be required.
inventories.    we record inventories at lower of cost or market. cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for scrap, and on a first-in, first-out, basis for other inventory. we record amounts required, if any, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold. if product selling prices were to decline in future periods, write-down of inventory could result, specifically raw material inventory such as scrap purchased during periods of peak market pricing.
impairments of long-lived tangible and finite-lived intangible assets.    we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amounts. the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary, including by way of examples, a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and/or projected cash flows, significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete, our strategy and capital planning, and the economic climate in markets to be served. when determining future cash flows and if necessary, fair value, we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady state, indicating a consistency in the operation's production capability, processes and cost structure, including the ability to utilize certain lower-cost raw materials. given this, we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of our minnesota ironmaking operation's fixed assets. with our current outlook regarding future operating costs and product pricing, we concluded that the carrying value of these fixed assets was no longer fully recoverable, and the fixed assets were in fact impaired. this assessment resulted in a $260.0 million impairment charge, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, recorded in the metals recycling and ferrous resources
51
operating segment. the carrying values of the impaired assets were adjusted to their expected fair values as determined primarily on the cost approach, as well as expected future discounted cash flows income approach, using level 3 inputs under asc 820.
in the third quarter of 2012, we terminated two small joint venture entities, which were not aligned with our long-term strategic focus. the decision to terminate these joint ventures triggered an assessment for impairment based on estimated realizable values, resulting in an impairment charge of $8.3 million being recorded. as these joint ventures are not reported within any of our reportable segments, reported segment results were not affected.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets.
our goodwill relates to various business combinations, and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31(in thousands):

omnisourcemetals recycling/ferrous resources segment                                                                                 $456,727             $463,247

at least once annually or when indicators of impairment exist, we perform an impairment test for goodwill. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally one level below our operating segments. we utilize a two-stepped approach to measuring goodwill impairment. the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment. in this step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount (which includes goodwill). the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows (income approach), and by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies. if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we perform the second step of the test, which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. in the second step, we compare the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value.
key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method (income approach) include: (a) expected cash flows for the five-year period following the testing date (including market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce and estimated capital needs); (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; and (c) a risk-adjusted discount rate based on management's best estimate of market participants' after-tax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums. key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair
52
values of its reporting units are estimated. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate.
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in past transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition. consequently, if operating results and/or economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models, but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. additionally, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. as a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed. therefore, we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts.
our other indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to trademarks acquired through various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands):
omnisourcemetals recycling/ferrous resources segment       $108,000
the techssteel segment                                            81,800
$189,800
at least annually or when indicators of impairment exist, we perform an impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount. the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a risk-adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows. if the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value.
our fourth quarter 2014 annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges. management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term. the most significant portion of our goodwill relates to the omnisource reporting unit. the fair value of omnisource exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%; however, our analysis contemplates growth in overall scrap consumption, and thus our sales volumes, and metal margins based on economic and industry forecasts, and some planned organic growth and cost containment activities. while management believes these assumptions are reasonable and their use appropriate, actual results may not meet forecasted results. an 11% decrease in forecasted cash flows would not result in a failure of step 1 for the omnisource reporting unit. the risk-adjusted discount rate used in the analysis is also a critical assumption, one in which a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value. a more than 95 basis point increase in the 12.0% risk-adjusted discount rate used in the omnisource analysis, holding other assumptions constant, would not result in a failure of step 1 for the reporting unit. we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year in an effort to determine if events and circumstances warrant interim impairment testing. otherwise, all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2015. changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate, could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

income taxes.    we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. we establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. we adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved. the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears. settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.

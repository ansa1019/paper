executive summary nrg energy, inc., or nrg or the company, is a competitive power company that produces, sells and delivers energy and energy services in major competitive power markets in the u.s. while positioning itself as a leader in the way residential, industrial and commercial consumers think about and use energy products and services. nrg is leading a customer-driven change in the u.s. energy industry by delivering cleaner and smarter energy choices, while building on the strength of one of the nation's largest and most diverse competitive power portfolios. the company owns and operates approximately 52,000 mws of generation; engages in the trading of wholesale energy, capacity and related products around those generation assets; transacts in and trades fuel and transportation services; and directly sells energy, services, and innovative, sustainable products and services to retail customers under the name "nrg" and various other retail brand names owned by nrg.
business environment the industry dynamics and external influences affecting the company and its businesses, and the power generation and retail energy industry in general in 2014 and for the future medium term include:
capacity markets - capacity markets are a major source of revenue for the company.  centralized capacity markets exist in iso-ne, miso, nyiso and pjm. bilateral markets exist in caiso and miso.  these auctions are either an annual market held three years ahead of the delivery period as in the case of pjm and iso-ne, or six months to one month ahead as in the case of nyiso.  many variables play into the prices derived in these auctions.  these variables include the load forecast, the target reserve margin, rules surrounding demand response, capacity imports and exports from the region, new generation entrants, slope of the demand curve, generation retirements, the cost of retrofitting old generation to meet new environmental rules, expected profitability of the plant itself in the energy market and various other auction rules.  in theory, a high capacity price should be an indication that the iso doesn't have sufficient generation capacity against its needed reserve margin and new construction should enter the market.  similarly, a low capacity price suggests the market is over-built and units should retire.  the company has seen many swings in the pricing for capacity markets and the rules in many of the markets are undergoing significant changes, as discussed in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
natural gas market - the price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where nrg operates power plants.  natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas consumers and producers.  in 2014, average natural gas prices at henry hub were 21% higher than 2013.  although supply continues to increase, reflecting increased production from mainly the shale basins, winter weather in january 2014 caused natural gas within several northeastern points to trade in excess of $100/mmbtu.  coordination between gas pipelines, local distribution company home heating load, gas generators, and isos needs to improve to ensure there are no reliability issues in the winter when home heating demands and the increased reliance on gas generation come into conflict.
60
if long-term gas prices decrease or remain depressed, the company is likely to encounter lower realized energy prices, leading to lower energy revenues as higher priced hedge contracts mature and are replaced by contracts with lower gas and power prices.  nrg's retail gross margins have historically improved as natural gas prices decline and are likely to partially offset the impact of declining gas prices on conventional wholesale power generation.  to further mitigate this impact, nrg may increase its percentage of coal and nuclear capacity sold forward using a variety of hedging instruments, as described under the heading "energy-related commodities" in item 15 - note 5, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, to the consolidated financial statements.  the company also mitigates declines in long term gas prices through its increased investment in renewable power generation supported by ppas as well as through the increasing portion of the fleet which benefits from capacity payments.
electricity prices - the price of electricity is a key determinant of the profitability of the company's generation portfolio. many variables such as the price of different fuels, weather, load growth and unit availability all coalesce to impact the final price for electricity and the company's profitability. in 2014, electricity prices in the company's core markets were generally higher than 2013 primarily due to higher natural gas prices.  in 2013, electricity prices in the company's core markets were generally higher than 2012 primarily due to higher natural gas prices. the following table summarizes average on-peak power prices for each of the major markets in which nrg operates for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012:

environmental regulatory landscape - the mats rule, finalized in 2012, is the driving regulatory force behind the decision to retrofit, repower or retire uncontrolled coal fired power plants. companies are nearly done with their plans to comply by april 2015 although many units have received extensions until april 2016 and the u.s. supreme court has agreed to review the rule. a number of regulations on ghgs, ambient air quality, coal combustion byproducts and water use with the potential for increased capital costs or operational impacts have been finalized or are still in development and under review by the epa. the design, timing and stringency of these regulations will affect the framework for the retrofit or retirement of existing fossil plants and deployment of new, cleaner technologies in the next decade. see item 1- business, environmental matters, for further discussion.
public policy support and government financial incentives for clean infrastructure development - policy mechanisms including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, rps, and carbon trading plans have been implemented at the state and federal levels to support the development of renewable generation, demand-side and smart grid, and other clean infrastructure technologies. the availability and continuation of public policy support mechanisms will drive a significant part of the economics of the company's development program and expansion into clean energy investments.
weather weather conditions in the regions of the u.s. in which nrg does business influence the company's financial results. weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels. changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the company's results in any given period. typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. the demand for and price of natural gas are higher in the winter. however, all regions of the u.s. typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus nrg is typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once.
61
other factors a number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for nrg's business. these factors include:
•   seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;
•   extreme peak demands;
•   available supply resources;
•   transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions;
•   location of nrg's generating facilities relative to the location of its load-serving opportunities;
•   procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and
•   changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations.
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. these effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in:
•   weather conditions;
•   market liquidity;
•   capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems;
•   local transportation systems; and
•   the nature and extent of electricity deregulation.

increase from the acquisition of dominion's competitive retail electric business in march 2014                        70
adverse weather impact due to higher supply costs on the incremental weather volumes in 2014 compared to 2013        (55   )
$107
•   trends - customer counts increased by approximately 627,000 since december 31, 2013 primarily due to the acquisition of the dominion retail electricity business in texas and its term contracts with electricity customers in the northeast. this also created a change in customer mix year over year, with increased volume in the northeast and an increase in price-sensitive customers in texas which drove overall unit margins down. excluding the customers acquired through dominion, unit margins on the legacy nrg home retail business in texas and the northeast remained consistent. the company expects to see continued attrition from the customers on expiring dominion term contracts in 2015 and to reach a steady state by the end of 2015. competition and higher supply costs based on forward natural gas prices and higher heat rates could drive lower unit margins in the future. future unit margins also may be impacted by changes in customer mix by region or customer segment.

the effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances in accordance with asc 740, income taxes, or asc 740. these factors and others, including the company's history of pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets.

net (loss)/income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $34 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. during the current year, income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the ivanpah and agua caliente projects and nrg yield, inc. were offset by the share of net losses allocated to tax equity investors in the nrg home solar and wind tax equity arrangements. this amount was determined as the change in the investors' interests between the beginning and end of each reported period calculated using the hypothetical liquidation at book value, or hlbv, method, less any capital contributions net of any capital distributions. the calculation depends on the specific contractual liquidation provisions of the arrangement and is affected by, among other factors, the tax attributes allocated to the investors including tax bonus depreciation, ptcs, itcs or u.s. treasury grants in lieu of the itcs, the existence of guarantees of minimum returns to the investors by nrg, and the allocation of tax income or losses including provisions that govern the level of deficits that can be funded by the investors in a liquidation scenario.

for the year ended december 31, 2014, total liquidity, excluding collateral received, increased by $245 million. changes in cash and cash equivalent balances are further discussed hereinafter under the heading cash flow discussion. cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2014 were predominantly held in money market funds invested in treasury securities, treasury repurchase agreements or government agency debt.
management believes that the company's liquidity position and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance operating and maintenance capital expenditures, to fund dividends to nrg's common and preferred stockholders, and other liquidity commitments. management continues to regularly monitor the company's ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management.
restricted payments tests of the $2.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents of the company as of december 31, 2014, $157 million and $322 million were held by genon mid-atlantic and rema, respectively. the ability of certain of genon's and genon americas generation's subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions is restricted under the terms of certain agreements, including the genon mid-atlantic and rema operating leases.  under their respective operating leases, genon mid-atlantic and rema are not permitted to make any distributions and other restricted payments unless:  (a) they satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters; (b) they are projected to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the two following periods of four fiscal quarters, commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such payment is proposed to be made; and (c) no significant lease default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.  in addition, prior to making a dividend or other restricted payment, rema must be in compliance with the requirement to provide credit support to the owner lessors securing its obligation to pay scheduled rent under its leases. based on genon mid-atlantic's and rema's most recent calculations of these tests, genon mid-atlantic and rema did not satisfy the restricted payments tests. as a result, as of december 31, 2014, genon mid-atlantic and rema could not make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments. each of genon mid-atlantic and rema may recalculate its fixed charge coverage ratios from time to time and, subject to compliance with the restricted payments test described above, make dividends or other restricted payments.
to the extent genon mid-atlantic or rema are able to pay dividends to genon, the genon senior notes due 2018 and 2020 and the related indentures restrict the ability of genon to incur additional liens and make certain restricted payments, including dividends. in the event of a default or if restricted payment tests are not satisfied, genon would not be able to distribute cash to its parent, nrg. at december 31, 2014, genon met the consolidated debt ratio component of the restricted payments test. if in the future, genon is unable to meet the consolidated debt ratio of component of the restricted payments test, genon's ability to make restricted payments, including dividends, loans and advances to nrg, is limited to specific exclusions, including up to $250 million of such restricted payments.

cash proceeds from sales and future sales of assets to nrg yield, inc.
on january 2, 2015, nrg yield, inc. acquired the following nrg entities: (i) wcep holdings, llc, which indirectly owns walnut creek, (ii) tapestry wind llc, which indirectly owns pinnacle, buffalo bear and taloga, and (iii) mission wind laredo, llc, which indirectly owns laredo ridge, for total cash consideration of $489 million, including adjustments for working capital, plus assumed project level debt of $737 million, on january 15, 2015, the company disclosed its intentions to continue to significantly invest in its residential and distributed generation solar businesses. given the long-term contracted and operating nature of these businesses, the associated assets could also be deemed eligible for an investment opportunity offer to nrg yield, inc. if an investment opportunity is offered to nrg yield, inc., it could represent an incremental source of liquidity for the company.
first lien structure nrg has granted first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of the company's assets, excluding assets acquired in the genon and eme (midwest generation) acquisitions, assets held by nrg yield, inc. and nrg's assets that have project-level financing. nrg uses the first lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedge agreements for forward sales of power or gas used as a proxy for power. to the extent that the underlying hedge positions for a counterparty are out-of-the-money to nrg, the counterparty would have claim under the first lien program. the first lien program limits the volume that can be hedged, not the value of underlying out-of-the-money positions. the first lien program does not require nrg to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. within the first lien structure, the company can hedge up to 80% of its coal and nuclear capacity, excluding genon coal capacity, and 10% of its other assets, excluding genon's other assets, with these counterparties for the first 60 months and then declining thereafter. net exposure to a counterparty on all trades must be positively correlated to the price of the relevant commodity for the first lien to be available to that counterparty. the first lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date.
the company's first lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged prices. as of december 31, 2014, all hedges under the first liens were in-the-money on a counterparty aggregate basis.
the following table summarizes the amount of mws hedged against the company's coal and nuclear assets and as a percentage relative to the company's coal and nuclear capacity under the first lien structure as of december 31, 2014:

uses of liquidity the company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) commercial operations activities; (ii) debt service obligations, as described more fully in item 15 - note 12, debt and capital leases, to the consolidated financial statements; (iii) capital expenditures, including repowering and renewable development, and environmental; and (iv) corporate transactions including return of capital and dividend payments to stockholders, as described in item 15 - note 15, capital structure, to the consolidated financial statements.
commercial operations the company's commercial operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. these liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) margin and collateral required to participate in physical markets and commodity exchanges; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (i.e. buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions; and (v) collateral for project development. as of december 31, 2014, commercial operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $187 million, and $746 million outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its commercial activities for both wholesale and retail transactions (includes a $42 million letter of credit relating to deposits at the puct that cover outstanding customer deposits and residential advance payments). as of december 31, 2014, total collateral held from counterparties was $72 million in cash, and $8 million of letters of credit.
future liquidity requirements may change based on the company's hedging activities and structures, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. in addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on the company's credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.

(b) the company has received questions and requests for additional documentation from the u.s. treasury for the remaining 10% of the ivanpah cash grant awards for which the company believes the outstanding amount to be valid and recoverable in 2015.

nrg believes it has complied with all material obligations under the 1603 cash grant program and is actively pursuing indemnification and is working with the u.s. treasury department to obtain payment on the remaining 1603 applications the company or its subsidiaries have submitted.

•   maintenance and environmental capital expenditures - for the year ended december 31, 2014, the company's environmental capital expenditures included $123 million related to controls to satisfy mats and nsr settlement at the big cajun ii facility and nox controls for the sayreville and gilbert facilities.
•   growth investments capital expenditures - for the year ended december 31, 2014, the company's growth investment expenditures included $256 million for solar projects and $66 million for the company's other growth projects.
environmental capital expenditures estimate based on current (and in some cases proposed) rules, technology and preliminary plans based on some proposed rules, nrg estimates that environmental capital expenditures from 2015 through 2019 required to comply with environmental laws will be approximately $641 million, which includes $58 million for genon and $464 million for eme. these costs are primarily associated with (i) controls to satisfy mats and recent nsr settlement at big cajun ii; (ii) controls to satisfy mats at w.a. parish, limestone and conemaugh; (iii) nox controls for sayreville and gilbert; and (iv) plant modifications to comply with environmental regulations at the powerton, joliet and waukegan plants acquired in the eme acquisition. nrg continues to explore cost-effective compliance alternatives to further reduce costs.
nrg's current contracts with the company's rural electric cooperative customers in the gulf coast region allow for recovery of a portion of the region's capital costs once in operation, along with a capital return, incurred by complying with any change in law, including interest over the asset life of the required expenditures. the actual recoveries will depend, among other things, on the timing of the completion of the capital projects and the remaining duration of the contracts.

nols, deferred tax assets and uncertain tax position implications, under asc 740
as of december 31, 2014, the company had domestic pre-tax book income of $126 million and foreign pre-tax book income of $9 million. for the year ended december 31, 2014, the company generated an nol of $1.2 billion which is available to offset taxable income in future periods. as of december 31, 2014, the company has cumulative domestic federal nol carryforwards of $4.3 billion which will begin expiring in 2026 and cumulative state nol carryforwards of $3.3 billion for financial statement purposes. in addition, nrg has cumulative foreign nol carryforwards of $228 million, of which $3 million will expire through 2015 and of which $225 million do not have an expiration date.
in addition to these amounts, the company has $71 million of tax effected uncertain tax benefits. as a result of the company's tax position, and based on current forecasts, nrg anticipates income tax payments, primarily due to state and local jurisdictions, of up to $50 million in 2015.
however, as the position remains uncertain for the $71 million of tax effected uncertain tax benefits, the company has recorded a non-current tax liability of $53 million and may accrue the remaining balance as an increase to non-current liabilities until final resolution with the related taxing authority. the $53 million non-current tax liability for uncertain tax benefits is from positions taken on various state returns, including accrued interest.
the company is no longer subject to u.s. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2010. with few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2009.
off-balance sheet arrangements obligations under certain guarantee contracts nrg and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. these arrangements include financial and performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. see also item 15 - note 26, guarantees, to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.
retained or contingent interests nrg does not have any material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.
derivative instrument obligation the company's 2.822% preferred stock includes a feature which is considered an embedded derivative per asc 815. although it is considered an embedded derivative, it is exempt from derivative accounting as it is excluded from the scope pursuant to asc 815. as of december 31, 2014, based on the company's stock price, the embedded derivative was out-of-the-money and had no redemption value. see also item 15 - note 15, capital structure, to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.
obligations arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity variable interest in equity investments - as of december 31, 2014, nrg has several investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy-related entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. several of these investments are variable interest entities for which nrg is not the primary beneficiary.
nrg's pro-rata share of non-recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $303 million as of december 31, 2014. this indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to nrg. see also item 15 - note 16, investments accounted for by the equity method and variable interest entities, to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.

the company has elected to disclose derivative assets and liabilities on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level. also, collateral received or paid on the company's derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the company's portfolio. as discussed in item 7a - quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, commodity price risk, nrg measures the sensitivity of the company's portfolio to potential changes in market prices using var a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. nrg's risk management policy places a limit on one-day holding period var, which limits the company's net open position. as the company's trade-by-trade derivative accounting results in a gross-up of the company's derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of nrg's hedging activity. as of december 31, 2014, nrg's net derivative asset was $413 million, an increase to total fair value of $24 million as compared to december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily driven by an increase in fair value of existing contracts due to the decreases in gas and power prices and contracts acquired during the period, partially offset by the roll off of contracts that settled during the period.
based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per mmbtu increase in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a decrease of approximately $422 million in the net value of derivatives as of december 31, 2014.
the impact of a $0.50 per mmbtu decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in an increase of approximately $402 million in the net value of derivatives as of december 31, 2014.

critical accounting policies and estimates nrg's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with u.s. gaap requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. the application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. these judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. in addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed.
on an ongoing basis, nrg evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the company considers reasonable. in any event, actual results may differ substantially from the company's estimates. any effects on the company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.
nrg's significant accounting policies are summarized in item 15 - note 2, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements. the company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the company's financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

derivative instruments the company follows the guidance of asc 815 to account for derivative instruments. asc 815 requires the company to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet and recognize changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings. in certain cases, nrg may apply hedge accounting to the company's derivative instruments. the criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure; (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item. changes in the fair value of derivatives instruments accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item, or deferred and recorded as a component of oci and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur.
for purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, nrg uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes. when external prices are not available, nrg uses internal models to determine the fair value. these internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. in order to qualify derivative instruments for hedged transactions, nrg estimates the forecasted generation and forecasted borrowings for interest rate swaps occurring within a specified time period. judgments related to the probability of forecasted generation occurring are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation, and historical physical delivery on similar contracts. judgments related to the probability of forecasted borrowings are based on the estimated timing of project construction, which can vary based on various factors. the probability that hedged forecasted generation and forecasted borrowings will occur by the end of a specified time period could change the results of operations by requiring amounts currently classified in oci to be reclassified into earnings, creating increased variability in the company's earnings. these estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.
certain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be npns. the availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that nrg has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. these assumptions are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation and historical physical delivery on contracts. derivatives that are considered to be npns are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under accrual accounting. if it is determined that a transaction designated as npns no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.
income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2014, nrg had a valuation allowance of $265 million. this amount is comprised of foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $64 million, foreign capital loss carryforwards of approximately $1 million and u.s. domestic state nols of $200 million. the company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income which includes the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences to realize deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. in arriving at this conclusion to utilize projections of future profit before tax in its estimate of future taxable income, the company considered the profit before tax generated in recent years.
nrg continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions. considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. nrg is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including operations located in australia.
the company is no longer subject to u.s. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2010. with few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2009.

evaluation of assets for impairment and other than temporary decline in value in accordance with asc 360, property, plant, and equipment, or asc 360, nrg evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. examples of such indicators or events are:
•   significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;
•   significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;
•   adverse business climate;
•   accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;
•   current-period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and
•   change in the company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. if such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to the company. generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. nrg uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs and operating costs. however, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the company's estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material.
for assets to be held and used, if the company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, nrg must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. assets held-for-sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. the estimation of fair value under asc 360, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held-for-sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective. nrg considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. in the absence of such information, the company may consider prices of similar assets, consult with brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. nrg will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability-weights a range of possible outcomes. the use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in the company's estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, the company determined that it would pursue retiring the 636 mw natural-gas fired coolwater facility, in dagget, california. the facility faced critical repairs on the cooling towers for units 3 and 4 and, during the fourth quarter of 2014, did not receive any awards in a near-term capacity auction and no interest in a bilateral capacity deal. the company considered this to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment test for these assets under asc 360, property, plant and equipment. the carrying amount of the assets was lower than the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and as a result, the assets are considered to be impaired. the company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets. the company retired the coolwater facility effective january 1, 2015. all remaining fixed assets of the station were written off resulting in an impairment loss of $22 million.
during the third quarter of 2014, the company determined that it will pursue mothballing the 463 mw natural gas-fired osceola facility, in saint cloud, florida. the company considered this to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment test for these assets under asc 360, property, plant and equipment. the carrying amount of the assets was lower than the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and as a result, the assets are considered to be impaired. the company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets. due to the location of the facility, it was determined that the best indicator of fair value is the market value of the combustion turbines. the company recorded an impairment loss of approximately $60 million, which represents the excess of the carrying value over the fair market value.
during the third quarter of 2014, the company recorded an impairment loss of $10 million to reduce the carrying value of certain solar panels to their approximate fair value.
98
annually during the fourth quarter, the company revises its views of power and fuel prices including the company's fundamental view for long term prices in connection with the preparation of its annual budget. changes to the company's views of long term power and fuel prices impacted the company's projections of profitability, based on management's estimate of supply and demand within the sub-markets for each plant and the physical and economic characteristics of each plant.
in the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's revised views of projected profitability for indian river resulted in a significant adverse change in the extent to which the assets are expected to be used. as a result, the company considered this to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment test for these assets under asc 360, property, plant and equipment. the carrying amount of the assets was lower than the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, considering project specific assumptions for long-term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. as a result, the assets are considered to be impaired, and the company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets. the fair value of the assets was determined by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to the company and included both an income approach and a market approach. the company recorded an impairment loss related to indian river in the fourth quarter of 2013 of $459 million, as described in note 10, asset impairments.
nrg is also required to evaluate its equity-method and cost-method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired. asc 323, investments - equity method and joint ventures, or asc 323, provides the accounting requirements for these investments. the standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under asc 323 is whether the value is considered an "other than a temporary" decline in value. the evaluation and measurement of impairments under asc 323 involves the same uncertainties as described for long-lived assets that the company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with asc 360. similarly, the estimates that nrg makes with respect to its equity and cost-method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material. additionally, if the projects in which the company holds these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of asc 360, nrg would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other than temporary decline in value under asc 323.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, the company reviewed its 37.5% interest in gladstone for impairment utilizing the other-than-temporary impairment model under asc 820, fair value measurements, due to future market expectations as well as discussions with the managing joint venture participants regarding the plant's expected life. in determining fair value, the company considered project specific assumptions for future project operating revenues and costs and expected plant operations. the carrying amount of the company's equity method investment exceeded the fair value of the investment and the company concluded that the decline is considered to be other than temporary. as a result, the company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the investment and recorded an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of 2013 of $92 million, as described in note 10, asset impairments.
goodwill and other intangible assets at december 31, 2014, nrg reported goodwill of $2.6 billion, consisting of $1.7 billion associated with the acquisition of texas genco in 2006, or nrg texas, $485 million for its nrg home businesses, approximately $330 million related to the acquisition of eme and $46 million associated with other business acquisitions. the company has also recorded intangible assets in connection with its business acquisitions, measured primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a level 3 measurement as defined in asc 820. see item 15 - note 3, business acquisitions and dispositions, and note 11, goodwill and other intangibles, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
the company applies asc 805, business combinations, or asc 805, and asc 350, to account for its goodwill and intangible assets. under these standards, the company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted-average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. however, goodwill and all intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairments at least annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. the company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the company's operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. the company performs the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of december 31 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. in 2011, nrg adopted the provisions of asu 2011-08, intangibles - goodwill and other (topic 350) testing goodwill for impairment, or asu 2011-08, which allows the consideration of qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred. in the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, goodwill impairment is determined utilizing a two-step process. if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, where necessary, the company's goodwill and/or intangible asset with indefinite lives will be impaired at that time.
99
the company performed step zero of the goodwill impairment test, performing its qualitative assessment of macroeconomic, industry and market events and circumstances; and the overall financial performance, subsequent to the april 2014, march 2014 and september 2014 acquisition dates, of the nrg wind llc (eme wind assets), dominion and goal zero reporting units, respectively. the company also performed step zero for the nrg home solar reporting unit, which is comprised of the goodwill of wholly owned subsidiaries rds and pure energies, acquired in march 2014 and october 2014, respectively. the company determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill attributed to these reporting units was less than its carrying amount; as such, the annual two-step impairment test was deemed not necessary to be performed for all of the reporting units tested with step zero for the year ended december 31, 2014.
the company performed step one of the two-step impairment test for the reporting units in the following table. the company determined the fair value of these reporting units using primarily an income approach. under the income approach, the company estimated the fair value of the reporting units' invested capital exceeds its carrying value and as such, the company concluded that goodwill associated with the reporting units in the following table is not impaired as of december 31, 2014:
reporting unit                                                                    % fair value over carrying value nrg business nrg curtailment solutions                                                                   138

the company also performed step one of the two-step impairment test for its texas reporting unit, nrg texas. the company determined the fair value of this reporting unit using primarily an income approach and then applied an overall market approach reasonableness test to reconcile that fair value with nrg's overall market capitalization. the company believes the methodology and assumptions used in the valuation are consistent with the views of market participants. significant inputs to the determination of fair value were as follows:
•   the company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for all of the plants in the region. the significant assumptions used to derive the long-term budgets used in the income approach are affected by the following key inputs:
◦   the company's views of power and fuel prices considers market prices for the first five-year period and the company's fundamental view for the longer term. hedging is included to the extent of contracts already in place;
◦   the terminal value in year 2020 is calculated using the gordon growth model, which assumes that the terminal value grows at a constant rate in perpetuity;
◦   projected generation and resulting energy gross margin in the long-term budgets is based on an hourly dispatch that simulates dispatch of each unit into the power market. the dispatch simulation is based on power prices, fuel prices, and the physical and economic characteristics of each plant.
•   the additional significant assumptions used in overall valuation of nrg texas are as follows:
◦   the discount rate applied to internally developed cash flow projections for the nrg texas reporting unit represents the weighted average cost of capital consistent with the risk inherent in future cash flows and based upon an assumed capital structure, cost of long-term debt and cost of equity consistent with comparable companies in the integrated utility industry.
◦   the intangible value to nrg texas for synergies it provides to nrg's retail businesses was determined by capitalizing estimated annual collateral charges and supply cost savings.
100
under step one, if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. under the income approach described above, the company estimated the fair value of nrg texas' invested capital was 11% below its carrying value as of december 31, 2014. the company also evaluated various market-derived data including market research forecasts, recent merger and acquisition activity and earnings multiples, and together with its estimate of fair value, concluded that step two was required. step two requires an allocation of fair value to the individual asset and liabilities using a hypothetical purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded. under the step two analysis it was determined that no goodwill impairment was necessary as of december 31, 2014.
to reconcile the fair value determined under the income approach with nrg's market capitalization, the company considered historical and future budgeted earnings measures to estimate the average percentage of total company value represented by nrg texas, and applied this percentage to an adjusted business enterprise value of nrg. to derive this adjusted business enterprise value, the company applied a range of control premiums based on recent market transactions to the business enterprise value of nrg on a non-controlling, marketable basis, and also made adjustments for some non-operating assets. the company was able to reconcile the proportional value of nrg texas to nrg's market capitalization at a value that would not indicate an impairment.
the company's estimate of fair value under the income approach described above is affected by assumptions about projected power prices, generation, fuel costs, capital expenditure requirements and environmental regulations, and the company believes that the most significant impact arises from future power prices. the price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where nrg operates power plants. due to downward trends in natural gas prices, the company performed a sensitivity scenario for its step two analysis by using a hypothetical $0.50 per mmbtu drop in the natural gas market price for the first five year period and a $0.50 per mmbtu drop in the company's longer-term fundamental view as used in the company's long-term budgets and the resulting impact to the implied heat rate that would support new build of combined cycle gas plant in the texas markets, coal and transportation charges, contracted hedges, and the impact on forecasted generation for the baseload plants during the budget period. under this sensitivity scenario, the fair value of nrg texas was 29% below its carrying value as of december 31, 2014. the company then allocated the revised fair value to the individual asset and liabilities using a hypothetical purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. under the hypothetical step two for the sensitivity scenario it was also determined that the fair value of the implied goodwill exceeded the carrying amount so no goodwill impairment was necessary as of december 31, 2014.
fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. as a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the nrg texas reporting unit may include such items as follows:
•   falling or depressed long-term natural gas prices which may result in lower power prices in the markets in which the texas reporting unit operates;
•   a significant change to power plants' new-build/retirement economics and reserve margins resulting primarily from unexpected environmental or regulatory changes; and/or
•   macroeconomic factors that significantly differ from the company's assumptions in timing or degree.
if long-term natural gas prices for periods beyond 2015 remain depressed for an extended period, the company's goodwill may become impaired in the future, which would result in a non-cash charge, not to exceed $1.7 billion, related to the nrg texas reporting unit.
contingencies nrg records a loss contingency when management determines it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. nrg describes in detail its contingencies in item 15 - note 22, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
what you will find in this md&amp;a our md&a includes the following major sections:
•   economic and market conditions affecting our operations;
•   financial performance summary;
•   results of our operations - consolidated and by segment;
•   liquidity and capital resources - where we discuss our cash flows;
•   off-balance sheet arrangements;
•   environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies; and
•   accounting matters - where we discuss critical accounting policies and areas requiring judgments and estimates.
economic and market conditions affecting our operations the strength of the u.s. housing market strongly affects our wood products and timberlands segments. as published by the u.s. census bureau, total u.s. housing starts for 2014 were slightly above 1,000,000 units, with single-family units accounting for 648,000 of the total. this represents a 5 percent increase in single-family starts from 2013, which was 618,000 units. multi-family construction also increased in 2014 to 358,000 units compared with 305,000 in 2013. while a significant improvement, current housing demand remains well below 1,000,000 single-family starts, the lowest level during the 15-year period of 1992-2007.
wood products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets. demand for wood products has continued to modestly improve in 2014 resulting in prices similar to those in 2013 for most lumber and plywood products. the significant exception was oriented strand board (osb) where 2014 prices were 31 percent below 2013 as measured by random lengths north central price.
demand for logs from our timberlands segment is affected by the production of wood-based building products as well as export demand in our western holdings. in the south, southern pine log prices were slightly higher in 2014 due to the modest improvement in the housing market while western log prices, helped by demand from china and japan, increased more substantially in 2014.
cellulose fibers is primarily affected by global supply and demand factors and the relative strength of the u.s. dollar. the severe winter weather in the first half of 2014 caused an inventory decline which took most of the year to correct, consequently prices for cellulose fibers were higher in 2014 than 2013. the u.s. dollar gained strength in 2014 as the euro declined 12 percent relative to the u.s. dollar due to slowing growth in eurozone economies.

comparing 2014 with 2013
net sales net sales increased $149 million - 2 percent - primarily due to:
•   timberlands segment sales increased $154 million, primarily due to higher log prices and increased sales volumes in the west, including our acquired longview timber holdings.
•   cellulose fibers segment sales increased $34 million, primarily due to higher sales realizations for pulp.
these increases were partially offset by a $39 million decrease in our wood products segment sales, primarily due to lower sales realizations for osb. this decrease in sales was partially offset by higher sales realizations and volumes for engineered wood products and lumber and increased sales from complementary building products.
net earnings attributable to weyerhaeuser common shareholders our net earnings attributable to weyerhaeuser common shareholders increased $1,242 million primarily due to:
•   a $926 million increase in earnings from discontinued operations, primarily due to a $972 million net gain on the real estate divestiture recognized in 2014;
•   a $333 million decrease in charges for restructuring, closure and asset impairments primarily related to a noncash impairment charge relating to a large master-planned community in north of las vegas, nevada which was retained by weyerhaeuser in the divestiture of weyerhaeuser real estate company (wreco);
•   a $206 million increase in gross margin in our timberlands and cellulose fibers segments, primarily due to higher sales realizations and owning longview timber for a full year;
•   a $166 million increase in other operating income, primarily due to a $151 million pretax gain recognized in 2014 related to a previously announced postretirement plan amendment; and
•   a $79 million decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses.
these increases were partially offset by:
•   a $356 million change in income taxes from a benefit in 2013 to an expense in 2014 primarily related to a previously unrecognized tax benefit recorded in 2013 and higher earnings in our taxable reit subsidiary (trs) in 2014; and
•   a $140 million decrease in gross margin in our wood products segment, primarily due to lower sales realizations in osb.
comparing 2013 with 2012
net sales net sales increased $1,265 million - 21 percent - primarily due to:
•   wood products segment sales increased $951 million, primarily due to higher sales realizations and higher sales volumes across all major product lines.
•   timberlands segment sales increased $266 million, primarily due to higher export and domestic log prices, increased sales volumes and the purchase of longview timber.
•   cellulose fibers segment sales increased $48 million primarily due to increased sales volumes.

net sales - unaffiliated customers net sales to unaffiliated customers increased $154 million - 11 percent - primarily due to a $144 million increase in western log sales due to higher log prices from our legacy western timberlands and a 17 percent increase in sales volumes including the increase related to the acquired longview timber holdings.
weyerhaeuser company > 2014 annual report and form 10-k 36
intersegment sales intersegment sales increased $68 million - 9 percent - primarily due to:
•   a $58 million increase in the united states primarily due to higher sales volumes including the increase related to acquired longview timber holdings and higher log prices in our legacy western and southern timberlands; and
•   a $10 million increase due to increased log and chip sales volumes in canada.
net contribution to earnings net contribution to earnings increased $143 million - 30 percent - primarily due to:

•   a $59 million increase due to higher log prices in our legacy western timberlands and the south;
•   a $20 million increase due to higher sales volumes in our legacy western timberlands; and
•   a $12 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding longview timber.
these increases were partially offset by a $40 million increase in operating costs in our legacy western timberlands due to increased log purchases.
comparing 2013 with 2012
net sales - unaffiliated customers net sales to unaffiliated customers increased $266 million - 25 percent - primarily due to:

•   southern log sales increased $23 million due to higher log prices and a 6 percent increase in sales volume as the result of increased thinning activity.
these increases were partially offset by:
•   a $16 million decrease in sales from our international operations primarily due to a shift toward internal sales of manufactured products; and
•   a $9 million decrease in chip sales.
intersegment sales intersegment sales increased $116 million - 17 percent - primarily due to:
•   a $71 million increase in the united states, primarily due to higher log prices and increased sales volume including the increase related to acquired longview timber holdings; and

liquidity and capital resources we are committed to maintaining a sound, conservative capital structure that enables us to:
•   protect the interests of our shareholders and lenders and
•   have access at all times to major financial markets.
cash from operations cash from operations includes:
•   cash received from customers;
•   cash paid to employees and suppliers;
•   cash paid for interest on our debt; and
•   cash paid or received for taxes.
consolidated net cash provided by our operations was:
•   $1,088 million in 2014,
•   $1,004 million in 2013 and
•   $581 million in 2012.
comparing 2014 with 2013
net cash provided by operations increased $84 million in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to:
•   cash received from customers increased $180 million as sales increased in our timberlands and cellulose fibers segments.
•   net cash inflows related to income taxes increased $70 million. we received income tax refunds of $52 million in 2014 and paid $18 million in 2013.
•   cash paid for interest decreased $43 million, primarily due to interest received related to tax refunds in 2014 and refinancing of debt in 2013.
these inflows were partially offset by a $189 million increase in cash paid to employees and suppliers primarily due to increased production and the acquisition of longview timber.
comparing 2013 with 2012
net cash provided by operations increased $423 million in 2013 as compared with 2012, primarily due to a $1,228 million increase in cash received from customers. this inflow was partially offset by:
•   cash paid to employees and suppliers increased $715 million as sales and production increased in our wood products and timberlands segments. receivables, primarily in our wood products segment, increased significantly in 2013 compared to 2012 as sales increased; and
•   net cash outflows related to discontinued operations increased $75 million.
pension contributions and benefit payments made and expected during 2014, we:
•   contributed $43 million for our canadian registered plan in accordance with minimum funding rules and respective provincial regulations;
•   contributed to or made benefit payments for our canadian nonregistered pension plans of $3 million;
•   made benefit payments of $24 million for our u.s. nonqualified pension plans; and
•   made benefit payments of $31 million for our u.s. and canadian other postretirement plans.
there was no minimum required contribution for our u.s. qualified plan for 2014, nor were any contributions made to this plan in 2014.
during 2015, based on estimated year-end assets and projections of plan liabilities, we expect to:
•   be required to contribute approximately $38 million for our canadian registered plan;
•   be required to contribute or make benefit payments for our canadian nonregistered plans of $3 million;
•   make benefit payments of $19 million for our u.s. nonqualified pension plans; and
•   make benefit payments of $26 million for our u.s. and canadian other postretirement plans.
we do not anticipate a contribution being required to our u.s. qualified pension plan for 2015.

•   $361 million in 2014,
•   $(1,829) million in 2013 and
•   $(192) million in 2012.
comparing 2014 with 2013
net cash from investing activities changed $2,190 million to an inflow in 2014 as compared with an outflow in 2013, primarily due to:
•   the acquisition of longview timber in 2013;
•   net proceeds from the real estate divestiture, net of cash divested in 2014; and
•   higher capital spending in 2014.
comparing 2013 with 2012
net cash used in investing activities increased $1,637 million in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to the acquisition of longview timber in 2013.
longview timber purchase on july 23, 2013, we purchased 100 percent of the equity interests in longview timber llc (longview timber) for $1.58 billion cash and assumed debt of $1.07 billion, for an aggregate purchase price of $2.65 billion. more information can be found in note 4: longview timber purchase in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the "cash from financing activities" section below.
real estate divestiture at the close of the real estate divestiture in july 2014, wreco used $744 million of the debt proceeds to repay intercompany debt and interest to weyerhaeuser company. the newly issued debt, remaining proceeds and other wreco assets and liabilities, including $5 million cash on hand, were acquired by tri pointe homes, inc. (tri pointe) when wreco became a wholly-owned subsidiary of tri pointe at the closing of the transaction. additionally, $32 million related to the adjustment amount payable pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement was paid to tri pointe. our net cash proceeds in connection with the real estate divestiture totaled $707 million. more information can be found in note 3: discontinued operations and the "cash from financing activities" section below.

we anticipate that our net capital expenditures for 2015 - excluding acquisitions - will be approximately $480 million to $500 million. however, that amount could change due to:
•   future economic conditions,
•   environmental regulations,
•   weather and

(1) amounts presented for interest payments assume that all long-term debt obligations outstanding as of december 31, 2014 will remain outstanding until maturity, and interest rates on variable-rate debt in effect as of december 31, 2014 will remain in effect until maturity.(2) purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations exclude arrangements that the company can cancel without penalty.(3) harvest commitments are purchased at market value and can be resold at market value in the future.(4) the timing of certain of these payments will be triggered by retirements or other events. these payments can include workers' compensation, deferred compensation and banked vacation, among other obligations. when the timing of payment is uncertain, the amounts are included in the total column only. minimum pension funding is required by established funding standards and estimates are not made beyond 2016. estimated payments of contractually obligated postretirement benefits are not included due to the uncertainty of payment timing.(5) we have recognized total liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $14 million as of december 31, 2014, including interest of $3 million. the timing of payments related to these obligations is uncertain; however, none of this amount is expected to be paid within the next year.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements have not had - and are not reasonably likely to have - a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. note 10: variable interest entities and note 12: lines of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements contain our disclosures of:
•   surety bonds,
•   letters of credit and guarantees and
•   information regarding variable interest entities.

accounting matters critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates. they also have a high degree of complexity.
in accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:
•   historical experience and
•   assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.
actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.
our most critical accounting policies relate to our:
•   pension and postretirement benefit plans;
•   potential impairments of long-lived assets; and
•   legal, environmental and product liability reserves.
details about our other significant accounting policies - what we use and how we estimate - are in note 1: summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
pension and postretirement benefit plans we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees. key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our:
•   expected long-term rate of return on plan assets,
•   discount rates,
•   anticipated trends in health care costs,
•   assumed increases in salaries and
•   mortality rates.
at the end of every year, we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include:
•   actual pension fund performance,
•   level of lump sum distributions,
•   plan changes and amendments,
•   changes in plan participation or coverage and
•   portfolio changes and restructuring.
this section provides more information about our:
•   expected long-term rate of return and
•   discount rates.
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. the expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the long-term rate of return that our plan assets will earn. our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans.
over the 30 years it has been in place, our u.s. pension trust investment strategy has achieved a 14.6 percent net compound annual return rate.
after considering available information at the end of 2014, we continue to assume an expected long-term rate of return of 9.0 percent. factors we considered include:
•   the net compounded annual return of 10.6 percent achieved by our u.s. pension trust investment strategy the past 5 years and
•   current and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets.
our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans. every 0.5 percent decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:
•   $23 million for our u.s. qualified pension plans and
•   $4 million for our canadian registered pension plans.
likewise, every 0.5 percent increase in our expected long-term rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts.
the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income (loss), a component of total equity.

discount rates our discount rates as of december 31, 2014, are:
•   4.1 percent for our u.s. pension plans - compared with 4.9 percent at december 31, 2013;
•   3.6 percent for our u.s. postretirement plans - compared with 4.0 percent at december 31, 2013;
•   3.9 percent for our canadian pension plans - compared with 4.7 percent at december 31, 2013; and
•   3.8 percent for our canadian postretirement plans - compared with 4.6 percent at december 31, 2013.
we review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed. the discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.
pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2015 will be based on the 4.1 percent and 3.6 percent assumed discount rates for u.s. plans and 3.9 percent and 3.8 percent assumed discount rates for the canadian plans.
our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. a 0.5 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:
•   $28 million for our u.s. qualified pension plans and
•   $5 million for our canadian registered pension plans.
likewise, every 0.5 percent increase in our expected long-term rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts.
long-lived assets we review the carrying value of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations. the carrying value is the amount assigned to long-lived assets in our financial statements.
an impairment occurs when the carrying value of long-lived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is more than fair market value. fair market value is the estimated amount we would receive if we were to sell the assets.
in determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred, we are required to estimate:
•   future cash flows,
•   residual values and
•   fair values of the assets.
key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include:
•   probability of alternative outcomes,
•   product pricing,
•   raw material costs,
•   product sales and
•   discount rate.
contingent liabilities we are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.
we record contingent liabilities when:
•   it becomes probable that we will have to make payments and
•   the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including:
•   historical experience,
•   judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts and
•   recommendations of legal counsel.
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur.
while we do our best in developing our projections, recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges in other (income) expense, net. these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year. see note 15: legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.

the table above includes utilities and corporate services, and non-regulated and parent eps from continuing operations, which are non-gaap financial measures. alliant energy believes utilities and corporate services, and non-regulated and parent eps from continuing operations are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends and provide additional information about alliant energy's operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. alliant energy's management also uses utilities and corporate services eps from continuing operations to determine performance-based compensation.
37
utilities and corporate services - higher eps from continuing operations in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to:
•   $0.70 per share of lower purchased electric capacity expense related to the previous daec ppa recorded in 2014 compared to 2013;
•   $0.33 per share of purchased electric capacity expense related to the kewaunee ppa that expired in 2013;
•   $0.06 per share of lower income tax expense at ipl in 2014 compared to 2013 due to iowa rate-making practices; and
•   $0.06 per share of charges related to preferred stock redemptions at ipl and wpl in 2013.
these items were partially offset by:
•   $0.39 per share of retail electric customer billing credits at ipl in 2014 related to an approved settlement agreement for its iowa retail electric base rates;
•   $0.11 per share of higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations at wpl in 2014 compared to 2013;
•   $0.08 per share of higher generation, distribution and customer service operation and maintenances expenses in 2014 compared to 2013;
•   an estimated $0.08 per share of net decreases in revenues from lower electric and gas sales in 2014 compared to 2013 due to weather conditions;
•   $0.08 per share of higher depreciation expense in 2014 compared to 2013;
•   $0.06 per share of higher interest expense in 2014 compared to 2013;
•   $0.05 per share from changes in the revenue requirement adjustment related to certain ipl tax benefits in 2014 compared to 2013;
•   $0.05 per share of higher electric transmission service expense, net of recoveries, in 2014 compared to 2013; and
•   $0.05 per share of lower electric margins related to changes in the recovery of fuel-related expense at wpl.

strategic overview strategic plan - the strategic plan focuses on the core business of delivering regulated electric and natural gas service in ipl's iowa and wpl's wisconsin service territories. the strategic plan is built upon three key elements: competitive costs, safe and reliable service, and responsible resources.
competitive costs - providing competitive and predictable energy costs for customers is a key element of the strategic plan. the majority of energy costs become part of rates charged to ipl's and wpl's customers and any rate increase has an impact on such customers. given that potential public policy changes and resulting increases in future energy costs are possible, there is a focus on controlling costs with the intent of providing competitive rates to ipl's and wpl's customers. for example, ipl and wpl have retail electric base rate freezes in iowa and wisconsin, respectively, during 2015 and 2016. ipl also has electric and gas tax benefit riders, which utilize tax benefits from income tax strategies to provide credits on iowa retail
40
customers' bills to help offset impacts of rate increases. refer to note 2 for additional discussion of the retail electric base rate freezes, and note 11 and "rate matters" for further discussion of the tax benefit riders.
safe and reliable service - the strategic plan also focuses resources on providing safe and reliable electricity and natural gas service. investments are expected to be targeted in electric and gas distribution system improvements, replacing aging infrastructure and distribution grid efficiency to maintain strong reliability. system performance is monitored and necessary steps are taken to continually improve the safety and reliability of service for customers. providing exceptional customer service, including emergency and outage response, is part of the mission and commitment to customers.
responsible resources - another key element of the strategic plan is finding innovative ways to meet environmental objectives, improve energy efficiency and provide resource flexibility. a diversified fuel mix for egus is important to meet the energy needs of customers and also recognizes the importance of using resources in environmentally responsible ways for the benefit of future generations. the current strategic plan, which is focused on a balanced and flexible portfolio of energy resources to meet ipl's and wpl's customers' short- and long-term energy needs, includes the following diversified and responsible portfolio of energy resources:
•   natural gas - purchasing, constructing and/or converting to natural gas-fired egus. ipl is currently constructing marshalltown, an approximate 650 mw natural gas-fired combined cycle egu, and m.l. kapp unit 2 is expected to switch from coal to natural gas as its only fuel type in 2015. wpl currently plans to file a cpcn application with the pscw in early 2015 for approval to construct an approximate 650 mw natural gas-fired combined cycle egu referred to as the riverside expansion.
•   coal - implementing emission controls and generation performance and reliability improvements at newer, larger and more efficient coal-fired egus, and fuel switching at, and retirement of, certain older, smaller and less efficient coal-fired egus.
•   ppas - purchasing electricity to meet a portion of customer demand for electricity, including wind power ppas and a nuclear generation ppa related to daec for a term of february 22, 2014 through december 31, 2025.
•   renewables - operating hydroelectric generators and current wind projects, as well as evaluating the development of future wind sites and solar projects. ipl and wpl currently have up to 400 mw and 200 mw of undeveloped wind sites, respectively, available for future wind projects. alliant energy, ipl and wpl are also exploring opportunities to integrate solar projects into the portfolio of energy resources as the cost to produce solar energy continues to decline.
installing emission controls at the more efficient coal-fired egus, increasing levels of energy produced by natural gas-fired egus, and increasing levels of energy produced by wind projects and other renewable energy resources results in significant environmental benefits. as a result of these efforts, so2 and nox emissions are currently expected to be reduced by approximately 90% and 80%, respectively, from 2005 levels by 2025. mercury emissions are currently expected to be reduced by approximately 90% from 2009 levels by 2025. co2 emissions have been reduced by approximately 15% from 2005 levels. additional generation portfolio details, as well as discussion of investments in emission controls and performance and reliability upgrades, are included in "generation plans" and "environmental compliance plans" below.
energy efficiency is also an important part of the strategic plan and provides customers with the opportunity to reduce their energy usage and related costs through the use of new energy efficient equipment, products and practices. ipl currently expects to spend approximately $400 million for electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs in iowa from 2014 through 2018. in addition, wpl contributes 1.2% of its annual utility revenues to wisconsin's focus on energy program. refer to "energy efficiency programs" below for further discussion of energy efficiency programs.
non-regulated operations - the strategic plan for alliant energy's non-regulated operations involves maintaining a modest portfolio of businesses that are accretive to earnings and cash flows but not significant users of capital.
generation plans - generation plans are reviewed and updated as deemed necessary and in accordance with regulatory requirements. alliant energy, ipl and wpl are currently evaluating the types of capacity and energy additions they will pursue to meet their customers' long-term energy needs and are monitoring several related external factors that could influence those evaluations. some of these external factors include regulatory policies and decisions, changes in long-term projections of customer demand, availability and cost effectiveness of different generation technologies, forward market prices for fossil fuels, market conditions for obtaining financing, developments related to federal and state rps, environmental requirements, such as any future requirements relating to ghg emissions or renewable energy sources, and federal and state tax incentives.

natural gas-fired generation -
ipl's construction of marshalltown - in 2013, the iub issued an order approving a siting certificate and establishing rate-making principles for ipl's construction of an approximate 650 mw natural gas-fired combined-cycle egu in marshalltown, iowa, referred to as marshalltown. in 2013, ipl accepted the iub's rate-making principles, which include the following:
•   a cost cap of $920 million, including costs to construct marshalltown, a pipeline to supply natural gas to marshalltown and transmission network upgrades to transmit electricity from marshalltown, as well as afudc. any costs incurred in excess of the cost cap are expected to be incorporated into rates if determined to be reasonable and prudent.
•   an 11% return on common equity for the 35-year depreciable life of marshalltown and a 10.3% return on common equity for the calculation of afudc related to the construction of marshalltown.
•   the application of double leverage is deferred until ipl's next retail electric base rate case or other proceeding.
in 2013, the iub approved the construction of a pipeline for the transportation of natural gas to marshalltown. after receiving the final necessary regulatory approvals and permits in the second quarter of 2014, ipl began constructing marshalltown. ipl currently expects to place marshalltown in service in the second quarter of 2017.
itc is currently expected to construct the majority of the required transmission network upgrades for marshalltown. ipl currently anticipates that itc will pursue an option under the terms of miso's attachment "x" tariff to self-fund these transmission network upgrades. as a result, itc would incur the capital expenditures to construct the transmission network upgrades and include a direct charge for such transmission network upgrade costs as part of its electric transmission service costs billed to ipl as the owner of marshalltown. refer to note 3 for further discussion of marshalltown.
wpl's proposed construction of the riverside expansion - wpl currently plans to file a cpcn application with the pscw in early 2015 for approval to construct an approximate 650 mw natural gas-fired combined-cycle egu in beloit, wisconsin, referred to as the riverside expansion. a decision from the pscw on wpl's request is currently expected by mid-2016. construction of the riverside expansion is also subject to the receipt of various approvals and permits necessary to construct and operate the egu. subject to such approvals, construction is currently expected to begin in 2016 and be completed by early 2019. capital expenditures are currently estimated to be approximately $725 million to $775 million to construct the egu and a pipeline to supply natural gas to the egu. the estimated capital expenditures exclude transmission network upgrades and afudc. the riverside expansion would replace energy and capacity being eliminated with the expected retirements of edgewater units 3 and 4, nelson dewey units 1 and 2, and the rock river and sheepskin combustion turbine units, which in aggregate have a nameplate capacity of approximately 700 mw.
in may 2014, the pscw authorized wpl to defer the retail portion of incremental pre-certification and pre-construction costs associated with this proposed egu beginning march 2014. wpl currently estimates deferral of such costs will be approximately $11 million in aggregate by december 31, 2015.
coal-fired generation -
emission controls projects - the strategic plan includes new emission controls at newer, larger and more efficient coal-fired egus to continue producing affordable energy for customers and to benefit the environment. refer to "environmental compliance plans" below for details regarding these emission controls projects including the capital expenditures in 2015 through 2018 currently anticipated for these projects. refer to note 3 for discussion of individual emission controls projects placed in service in 2014.
generation improvement projects - the strategic plan includes investments in generation maintenance and performance improvements at newer, larger and more efficient coal-fired egus, including wpl's edgewater unit 5 and columbia units 1 and 2. refer to "liquidity and capital resources" for details regarding estimated capital expenditures in 2015 through 2018 for these generation maintenance and performance improvement projects. construction of ipl's ottumwa unit 1 generation maintenance and performance improvements was completed in 2014.
columbia units 1 and 2 - in january 2014, wpl received an order from the pscw approving a request for generation maintenance and performance improvements at columbia units 1 and 2. wpl's portion of the capital expenditures for the projects, excluding afudc, is currently estimated to be between $55 million and $65 million. wpl currently expects to begin construction in the first half of 2015 and place the projects in service by the end of 2017.
42
plant retirements or fuel switching - the current strategic plan includes the retirement of several older, smaller and less efficient egus in the next few years as follows:

(a)   nameplate capacity represents the nominal amount of electricity an egu is designed to produce. each egu is also assessed a generating capacity amount from miso through its annual resource adequacy process. the generating capacity amount assessed by miso is subject to change each year and is based upon the current performance capability of the egu and is based on historical forced outages.
(b)   as of december 31, 2014, the aggregate net book value of egus that may be retired in the future in the table above was $57 million for ipl and $88 million for wpl.
(c)   ipl received approval from miso to retire dubuque units 3 and 4, contingent on completion of transmission network upgrades necessary for system reliability. final miso studies could indicate that the retirement of fox lake unit 3 may result in reliability issues and that transmission network upgrades for system reliability are necessary to enable such retirements. under the current miso tariff, the specific timing for the retirement of these egus could depend on the timing of the required transmission network upgrades as well as various operational, market and other factors.
(d)   the retirements of fox lake unit 3, sutherland units 1 and 3, and other units are contingent on the construction of marshalltown as well as various operational, market and other factors.
(e)   wpl received approval from miso to retire edgewater unit 3, and nelson dewey units 1 and 2, contingent on completion of transmission network upgrades necessary for system reliability.
(f)   reflects wpl's 68.2% ownership interest in edgewater unit 4.
(g)   the retirements of edgewater unit 4 and the rock river and sheepskin combustion turbine units are contingent on the construction of the riverside expansion as well as various operational, market and other factors.
in addition, ipl's m.l. kapp unit 2, which was placed in service in 1967 and has a nameplate capacity of 218 mw, is expected to switch from coal to natural gas as its only fuel type in 2015, contingent on approval from miso.
alliant energy, ipl and wpl are working with miso, state regulatory commissions and other regulatory agencies, as required, to determine the final timing of these actions. the expected dates for the retirement and fuel switching of these egus are subject to change depending on operational, regulatory, market and other factors. the potential retirement of other egus within the generation fleet continues to be evaluated.
nuclear generation -
ipl's daec ppa - in 2013, the iub issued an order allowing ipl to proceed with a ppa for the purchase of capacity and energy generated by daec located near palo, iowa. the iub also authorized ipl to recover the iowa retail portion of the cost of the daec ppa from iowa retail electric customers through the energy adjustment clause. the terms of the ppa provide ipl the right to the counterparty's entire output quantities (70% of the total plant output) in exchange for payment from ipl to the counterparty based on the amount of mwhs received by ipl. ipl will purchase up to 431 mws of capacity and the resulting energy from daec for a term from february 22, 2014 through december 31, 2025. among the terms and conditions of the ppa are guarantees by the counterparty to provide minimum amounts of capacity and energy. the ppa also contains provisions for the replacement of energy from alternative sources under certain conditions as well as provisions that convey to ipl the potential environmental attributes associated with its portion of the output from daec. refer to "rate matters" for further discussion of the iub's 2013 order approving the daec ppa.

wind generation -
resources' franklin county wind project - the franklin county wind project began generating electricity in 2012. resources is currently selling the electricity output from the wind project into the miso market as a merchant generator, and is considering different options for this wind project. such options include entering into a ppa with an independent third party, ipl or wpl; selling the project to an independent third party, ipl or wpl; or continuing to sell the output into the miso market as a merchant generator. refer to note 3 for further discussion of the franklin county wind project.
undeveloped wind sites - ipl has up to 400 mw of wind site capacity remaining in franklin county, iowa. wpl has approximately 200 mw of wind site capacity remaining in freeborn county, minnesota. future development of the balance of these wind sites will depend on numerous factors such as changes in customer demand, rps, environmental requirements, electricity and fossil fuel prices, wind project costs, technology advancements and transmission capabilities.
gas distribution systems - the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration is expected to expand and/or strengthen regulations related to natural gas transmission and distribution systems in 2015. these changes are expected to help ensure natural gas transmission and distribution systems are properly maintained and operated safely. these changes are also expected to result in more inspections and potential replacement of certain portions of alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's natural gas transmission and distribution systems. in addition, alliant energy, ipl and wpl are currently extending various natural gas transmission and distribution systems in their existing iowa and wisconsin service territories to serve new customer demand. estimated capital expenditures for these expected and current projects for 2015 through 2018 are included in the "gas distribution systems" line in the construction and acquisition expenditures table in "liquidity and capital resources."
utility business divestitures -
ipl's minnesota electric and natural gas distribution assets - refer to note 3 for discussion of the mpuc's order approving the proposed sale of ipl's minnesota natural gas distribution assets, as well as the anticipated sale of ipl's minnesota electric distribution assets. alliant energy and ipl currently do not expect the sales of these assets to have a significant impact on their earnings for 2015.
environmental compliance plans - environmental compliance plans have been developed to help ensure cost effective compliance with current and proposed environmental laws and regulations. significant reductions of future emissions of nox, so2, pm, mercury and other haps at egus are expected to be required as a result of these environmental laws and regulations. environmental compliance plans are reviewed and updated to address various external factors, as deemed necessary and in accordance with regulatory requirements. some of these external factors include regulatory decisions regarding proposed emission controls projects, developments related to environmental regulations, outcomes of legal proceedings, settlements reached with environmental agencies and citizens groups, availability and cost effectiveness of different emission reduction technologies, market prices for electricity and fossil fuels, market prices for emission allowances, market conditions for obtaining financings, and federal and state tax incentives. refer to "environmental matters" for details of certain current and proposed environmental regulations, including regulations for which these compliance plans are expected to support. the following table provides current estimates of capital expenditures planned for 2015 through 2018 as well as the total (past and future) project costs for certain emission controls projects included in current environmental compliance plans (in millions):

(a)   scrubber is a post-combustion process that injects lime or lime slurry into the stream of gases leaving the egu boiler to remove so2 and other acid gases (including hydrochloric acid) and capture them in a solid or liquid waste by-product. a scrubber typically removes more than 90% of the so2 emissions.
baghouse, including carbon injection, is a post-combustion process that injects carbon particles into the stream of gases leaving the egu boiler to facilitate the capture of mercury in filters or bags. this process can remove more than 85% of mercury emissions.
scr is a post-combustion process that injects ammonia or urea into the stream of gases leaving the egu boiler to convert nox emissions into nitrogen and water. the use of a catalyst enhances the effectiveness of the conversion, enabling nox emissions reductions of up to 90%.

these capital expenditure estimates represent ipl's or wpl's respective portion of the total escalated capital expenditures and exclude afudc, if applicable. capital expenditure estimates are subject to change based on future changes to plant-specific costs of emission controls technologies and environmental requirements.
ipl's emission controls projects - under iowa law, ipl is required to file an epb biennially. filing of periodic reports regarding the implementation of ipl's compliance plan and related budget identified in an epb is also currently required under a settlement agreement between ipl and the iowa office of consumer advocate. an epb provides a utility's compliance plan and related budget for managing regulated emissions from its coal-fired egus in a cost-effective manner. iub approval of an epb demonstrates that the iub believes the epb is reasonably expected to achieve cost-effective compliance with applicable state environmental requirements. in february 2013, the iub approved ipl's epb, which includes the emission controls project for lansing unit 4 listed in the above table. alliant energy and ipl currently expect the iub to issue its decision by mid-2015 on an updated epb, which also includes the emission controls project for lansing unit 4 listed in the above table.
lansing unit 4 - ipl is constructing a scrubber at lansing unit 4 to reduce so2 emissions at the egu. the scrubber at lansing unit 4 is expected to support compliance obligations for current and anticipated air quality regulatory requirements, including csapr.
wpl's emission controls projects - wpl must file a ca application and receive authorization from the pscw to proceed with any individual emission controls project with an estimated project cost of $10 million or more.
edgewater unit 5 - in june 2013, wpl received an order from the pscw approving wpl's ca application to install a scrubber and baghouse at edgewater unit 5 to reduce so2 and mercury emissions at the egu. the scrubber and baghouse are expected to support compliance obligations under the mats rule and csapr, as well as the consent decree entered into with the epa and the sierra club in 2013.
columbia unit 2 - in january 2015, wpl received an order from the pscw approving wpl's ca application to install an scr system at columbia unit 2 to reduce nox emissions at the egu. the scr is expected to support compliance obligations for current and anticipated air quality requirements, including csapr and requirements under the consent decree referenced above.
refer to note 16(e) for discussion of a consent decree approved by the court in 2013, which includes a requirement for wpl to install emission controls systems noted above at certain of its egus.
energy efficiency programs - several energy efficiency programs and initiatives help customers reduce their energy usage and related costs through the use of new energy efficient equipment, products and practices. the following are current key energy efficiency programs:
ipl eep - in 2013, ipl received an order from the iub approving ipl's eep for 2014 through 2018. the eep includes ipl spending approximately $400 million for electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs in iowa from 2014 through 2018, and is expected to conserve electric and natural gas usage equal to that of more than 100,000 homes. in accordance with iowa law, ipl is required to file an eep every five years. an eep provides a utility's plan and related budget to achieve specified levels of energy savings. iub approval demonstrates that the iub believes that ipl's eep is reasonably expected to achieve cost effective delivery of the energy efficiency programs. to the extent approved by the iub, costs associated with executing the eep are recovered from ratepayers through an additional tariff called an eecr factor. the eecr factors are revised annually and include a reconciliation to eliminate any over- or under-recovery of energy efficiency expenses from prior periods. there are no carrying costs associated with the cost recovery factors. the annual eecr factors are based on ipl's approved budget as filed with its eep, along with any over- or under-collection from prior periods, and therefore are not expected to have a material impact on alliant energy's and ipl's financial condition or results of operations.
focus on energy program - in 2014 and 2013, wpl contributed 1.2% of annual utility revenues to help fund focus on energy, wisconsin's state-wide energy efficiency and renewable energy resource program.

(a)   in iowa, ipl's interim rates can be implemented 10 days after the filing date, without regulatory review and are subject to refund, pending determination of final rates. in minnesota, ipl's interim rates can be implemented 60 days after the filing date, with regulatory review and are subject to refund, pending determination of final rates. the amount of the interim rates is replaced by the amount of final rates once the final rates are effective.
(b)   base rate changes reflect both returns on additions to infrastructure and recovery of changes in costs incurred or expected to be incurred. given that a portion of the rate changes will offset changes in costs, revenues from rate changes should not be expected to result in an equal change in net income for either ipl or wpl.
wpl's wisconsin retail electric and gas rate case (2015/2016 test period) - in july 2014, wpl received an order from the pscw authorizing wpl to maintain retail electric base rates at their current levels through the end of 2016. the retail electric base rate case included a return of and a return on costs for emission controls projects at columbia units 1 and 2 and edgewater unit 5, generation performance and reliability improvements at columbia units 1 and 2, other ongoing capital expenditures, and an increase in electric transmission service expense. the additional revenue requirement for these cost increases was offset by the impact of changes in the amortization of regulatory liabilities associated with energy efficiency cost recoveries and increased sales volumes. the order also authorizes wpl to implement a $5 million decrease in annual retail gas base rates effective january 1, 2015 followed by a freeze of such gas base rates through the end of 2016.
the order requires escrow treatment of major transmission charges, allows continuation of an 8.2% afudc recovery rate, and allows continuation of a 10.4% return on common equity and the following related provisions: (1) wpl may request a change in retail base rates during the test period if its annual regulatory return on common equity falls below 8.5%; and (2) wpl must defer a portion of its earnings if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeds 10.65% during the test period. wpl must defer 50% of its excess earnings between 10.65% and 11.40%, and 100% of any excess earnings above 11.40%. in addition, the order allows wpl to maintain its ability to request deferrals based on current practices.
refer to note 2 for discussion of wpl's retail fuel-related filing for 2015. the fuel-related cost component of wpl's retail electric rates for 2016 will be addressed in a separate filing. refer to note 7 for details of wpl's regulatory limitation on distributions of common stock dividends to its parent company in 2015 and 2016.
wpl's wisconsin retail electric and gas rate case (2013/2014 test period) - in july 2012, wpl received an order from the pscw authorizing wpl to implement a decrease in annual retail gas base rates of $13 million effective january 1, 2013 followed by a freeze of such gas base rates through the end of 2014. the order also authorized wpl to maintain retail electric base rates at their current levels through the end of 2014. recovery of the costs for the acquisition of riverside, the scr project at edgewater unit 5 and the scrubber and baghouse projects at columbia units 1 and 2 were included in the request. the recovery of the costs for these capital projects were offset by decreases in rate base resulting from increased net deferred tax liabilities, the impact of changes in the amortizations of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, and the reduction of capacity payments. the order included continuation of a 10.4% return on common equity and a provision that required wpl to defer a portion of its earnings if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeds 10.65% during the test period. the amount of earnings wpl must defer is equal to 50% of its excess earnings between 10.66% and 11.40% and 100% of any excess earnings above 11.40%. as of december 31, 2014, alliant energy and wpl deferred $9 million of wpl's 2013 and 2014 earnings for this provision.

refer to note 2 for details of wpl's retail fuel-related filings for 2013 and 2014 and details of impacts to "regulatory assets" on alliant energy's and wpl's balance sheets from the pscw's july 2012 order.
ipl's iowa retail gas rate case (2011 test year) - in may 2012, ipl filed a request with the iub to increase annual rates for its iowa retail gas customers based on a 2011 historical test year as adjusted for certain known and measurable changes occurring up to 12 months after the commencement of the proceeding. the key drivers for the filing included recovery of capital investments since ipl's last iowa retail gas rate case filed in 2005. in conjunction with the filing, ipl implemented an interim retail gas rate increase of $9 million, or approximately 3%, on an annual basis, effective june 4, 2012.
in november 2012, the iub approved a settlement agreement between ipl, the iowa office of consumer advocate and the iowa consumers coalition related to ipl's request resulting in a final increase in annual rates for ipl's iowa retail gas customers of $11 million, or approximately 4%, effective january 10, 2013, a 9.6% return on common equity after the application of double leverage and the adoption of ipl's gas tax benefit rider discussed below.
ipl's iowa retail electric rate settlement agreement - in january 2013, the iub issued an order allowing ipl to proceed with its daec ppa for a term of february 22, 2014 through december 31, 2025 and authorized ipl to recover the iowa retail portion of the costs of such ppa from iowa retail electric customers through the energy adjustment clause beginning february 22, 2014. the january 2013 order encouraged ipl to continue discussions with parties to the daec ppa proceeding to reach an agreement to resolve concerns expressed by such parties during the proceeding regarding rate impacts for ipl's iowa retail electric customers beginning in 2014.
in september 2014, the iub approved a settlement agreement, which was based on a unanimous agreement among parties to the daec ppa proceeding. the settlement agreement extends ipl's iowa retail electric base rates authorized in its 2009 test year case through 2016 and provides retail electric customer billing credits of $105 million in aggregate, including targeting $70 million in 2014 (beginning may 2014), $25 million in 2015 and $10 million in 2016. in 2014, ipl recorded $72 million of such retail electric customer billing credits. ipl will make adjustments to future billing credits to provide retail electric customer billing credits of $105 million in aggregate. the settlement agreement included the continuation of the energy adjustment clause, transmission cost rider and electric tax benefit rider credits; the ability for ipl to seek rate relief if a significant event occurs; and the ability for parties to the daec ppa proceeding to request show cause action if ipl's iowa retail electric return on common equity exceeds 11% for 2014, 2015 or 2016.
items considered in settlement discussions included costs for emission controls at ottumwa unit 1, george neal units 3 and 4, burlington unit 1 and prairie creek units 3 and 4, generation performance and reliability improvements at ottumwa unit 1, and other ongoing capital expenditures; the elimination of purchased electric capacity payments from the previous daec ppa that ended in february 2014; and costs of the new daec ppa. ipl assumes no change to its current authorized return on common equity and common equity component of the regulatory capital structure authorized in its 2009 test year case.
wpl's retail fuel-related rate filings - refer to note 2 for discussion of wpl's retail fuel-related rate filings for test years 2012 through 2015.
ipl's tax benefit riders - in 2009, ipl filed a request with the iub to create a regulatory liability account for potential tax benefits resulting from changes in tax accounting methodologies and tax elections available under the internal revenue code. these potential tax benefits are related to the tax treatment of repairs expenditures, allocation of insurance proceeds from floods in 2008 and allocation of mixed service costs. in 2012, ipl filed a report with the iub requesting approval of the final amount of the regulatory liability account based on the tax benefits generated from these changes in tax accounting methodologies and tax elections that were sustained under irs audit. the 2012 report filed by ipl identified approximately $500 million of such tax benefits, which included $452 million allocated for use with the electric tax benefit rider and $48 million allocated for use with the gas tax benefit rider discussed below. refer to "property method changes" below for discussion of additional tax benefits recorded in 2014 from two additional tax accounting method changes implemented in 2014.
electric - the electric tax benefit rider, which was approved by the iub and implemented in 2011, utilizes amounts from the regulatory liability account to credit bills of iowa retail electric customers to help offset the impact of rate increases on such customers. these credits on customers' electric bills reduce electric revenues based on customers' kwh usage. in december 2014, the iub issued an order authorizing $75 million of regulatory liabilities from tax benefits to be credited to ipl's retail electric customers' bills in iowa during 2015 through the electric tax benefit rider. in december 2014, the iub also authorized ipl to reduce the $75 million of billing credits on customers' bills by $15 million in 2015 to recognize the revenue

requirement impact of the changes in tax accounting methods. ipl expects the iub will approve distribution of any remaining benefits in 2016 and 2017.
gas - ipl's may 2012 retail gas rate case filing with the iub included a proposal to utilize regulatory liabilities to credit bills of iowa retail gas customers to help mitigate the impact of the proposed final rate increase on such customers. these credits on customers' gas bills reduce gas revenues based on a fixed amount per day. in november 2012, ipl received an order from the iub authorizing the gas tax benefit rider. the iub's order authorized approximately $12 million of regulatory liabilities from tax benefits to be credited to ipl's retail gas customers' bills in iowa annually from january 2013 through december 2015 through the gas tax benefit rider. any remaining benefit, including any portion not utilized of the agreed upon amount from january 2013 through december 2015, is expected to be credited to iowa's retail gas customers' bills in 2016.
utilization of tax benefit riders - ipl's tax benefit riders regulatory liability account has been utilized to credit bills of iowa retail electric customers as follows:
electric           gas           total regulatory liability account balance approved by iub        $452            $48            $500

environmental matters overview - alliant energy, ipl and wpl are subject to regulation of environmental matters by federal, state and local authorities as a result of their current and past operations. alliant energy, ipl and wpl monitor these environmental matters and address them by installing controls that reduce emissions and by implementing operational modifications or other measures to address compliance obligations. these programs are subject to continuing review and are periodically revised due to various factors, including but not limited to changes in environmental regulations, litigation of environmental requirements, construction plans and compliance costs. there is currently significant regulatory uncertainty with respect to a number of environmental rules and regulations discussed below. given the dynamic nature of environmental regulations and other related regulatory requirements, alliant energy, ipl and wpl have compliance plans to address these environmental obligations. future expenditures for environmental compliance are expected to be material, including significant capital investments. prudent expenditures incurred by ipl and wpl to comply with environmental requirements would likely be recovered in rates from their customers. refer to "strategic overview - environmental compliance plans" for details of environmental compliance plans, including discussion of specific projects and the associated estimated capital expenditures. the following are major environmental matters that could potentially have a significant impact on financial condition and results of operations.
air quality - the caa and its amendments mandate preservation of air quality through existing regulations and periodic reviews to ensure adequacy of the caa provisions based on scientific data. as part of the basic framework under the caa, the epa is required to establish naaqs rules, which serve to protect public health and welfare. these rules address six "criteria" pollutants, four of which (nox, so2, pm and ozone) are particularly relevant to electric utility operations. ozone is not directly emitted from egus; however, nox emissions may contribute to its formation in the atmosphere. fine particulate matter may also be formed in the atmosphere from so2 and nox emissions.
sips document the collection of regulations that individual state agencies will apply to maintain naaqs rules and related caa requirements. the epa must approve each sip and if a sip is not acceptable to the epa or if a state chooses not to issue separate state rules, then the epa can assume enforcement of the caa in that state by issuing a federal implementation plan. routinely monitored locations that do not comply with naaqs rules may be classified by the epa as non-attainment and require further actions to reduce emissions. additional emissions standards may also be applied under the caa regulatory framework beyond naaqs rules. the specific federal and state air quality rules that may affect operations are listed in the table below. refer to the sections below the following tables for detailed discussion of the following air quality rules.

(a)   m.l. kapp unit 2 is expected to switch from coal to natural gas as the only fuel type in 2015, contingent on approval from miso.
as discussed in greater detail below, a number of these air regulations are subject to legal challenges, reconsideration and/or other uncertainties that affect the ability to predict with certainty what impact such regulations may have on financial condition and results of operations.
csapr - csapr is a regional so2 and nox cap-and-trade program, where compliance with emission limits may be achieved by purchasing emission allowances and/or reducing emissions through changes in operations or the additions of emission controls. in 2015, csapr replaced cair. compliance with csapr emissions limits began in 2015, with additional emissions limits reductions beginning in 2017. the emission allowances used for acid rain and cair program compliance cannot be used for compliance with csapr. csapr emission allowances may be banked for future year compliance. alliant energy, ipl and wpl will continue to monitor legal and regulatory developments related to csapr and currently expect to meet the final compliance requirements based on planned and completed emission controls projects for various egus.
cavr - cavr requires states to develop and implement plans to address visibility impairment in designated national parks and wilderness areas across the u.s. with a national goal of no impairment by 2064. these implementation plans require bart emission controls at certain ipl and wpl fossil-fueled egus that were built between 1962 and 1977 and other additional measures needed for reducing state contributions to regional haze. ipl's facilities that may be impacted include burlington unit 1, george neal units 3 and 4, prairie creek unit 4, m.l. kapp unit 2 and lansing unit 4. wpl's facilities that may be impacted include edgewater unit 4, nelson dewey unit 2, and columbia units 1 and 2.
50
in 2012, the epa published a final rule (bart-csapr rule) that allowed bart obligations for so2 and nox emissions to be fulfilled by compliance with csapr. in 2012, the epa approved wisconsin's cavr plan, which relied on the epa's bart-csapr rule. in 2012, the epa issued a federal plan specifying that iowa's compliance with csapr would be sufficient to meet cavr requirements. groups have legally challenged the epa's reliance on csapr to satisfy cavr bart requirements. alliant energy, ipl and wpl currently expect to comply with csapr requirements, thereby satisfying cavr bart requirements.
mats rule - in 2011, the epa issued the final mats rule for existing coal-fired egus, which requires emission limits for mercury and other haps and work practice standards. compliance with the mats rule is required by april 2015; however, an entity can request an additional year for compliance for egus that are needed to assure power reliability, egus needed while building replacement generation or repowering to gas, or egus that need additional time to install air emission controls technology. in february 2014, the wisconsin dnr approved an extension to the mats rule compliance deadline for wpl's edgewater unit 3 and nelson dewey units 1 and 2 to april 2016. in february 2015, ipl filed with the epa for approval to extend the mats rule compliance deadline to april 2016 for m.l. kapp unit 2. in 2014 and 2013, ipl and wpl implemented emission controls projects at several of their newer, larger and more efficient egus. construction of lower-cost emission controls projects at ipl's burlington unit 1 and prairie creek units 3 and 4, and wpl's edgewater unit 4 were also completed in 2014. these projects support compliance obligations for current and anticipated air quality regulatory requirements, including the mats rule. as a result of these projects and the requests for extension of the compliance deadline for three egus, additional capital investments and modifications to ipl's and wpl's egus to comply with the mats rule are currently not expected to be significant. given that this rule remains subject to legal challenges, and could possibly be revised or invalidated pending the outcome of court decisions, alliant energy, ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact of the mats rule on their financial condition and results of operations.
in accordance with wisconsin statutes, egus complying with the mats rule by april 2015 would no longer be subject to the wisconsin state mercury rule.
industrial boiler and process heater mact rule - in 2012, the epa issued a final reconsidered industrial boiler and process heater mact rule with a compliance deadline of january 2016 for major sources; however, an entity can request an additional year for compliance, which may be granted on a case-by-case basis by state permitting authorities. in december 2014, the epa issued notices of reconsideration for select elements of the rule. the rule is expected to apply to ipl's prairie creek boilers 1, 2 and 5, and fossil-fueled auxiliary boilers and process heaters operated at other ipl and wpl fossil-fueled generating facilities. the rule requires compliance with haps emission limitations and work practice standards. given that this rule remains subject to legal challenges in the d.c. circuit court, alliant energy and ipl are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact of the industrial boiler and process heater mact rule on their financial condition and results of operations, but expect that capital investments and/or modifications to their generating facilities to meet compliance requirements of the rule could be significant. future capital investments and modifications to wpl's generating facilities to comply with this rule are currently not expected to be significant.
ozone naaqs rule - the 2008 ozone naaqs rule may require a reduction of nox emissions in certain non-attainment areas based on classifications assigned by the epa. there are five non-attainment classifications: marginal, moderate, serious, severe and extreme. in 2012, the epa issued a final rule that classified sheboygan county in wisconsin as marginal ozone non-attainment, which requires this area to achieve the 2008 eight-hour ozone naaqs by december 2015. wpl operates edgewater and sheboygan falls in sheboygan county, wisconsin. the final rule does not list any non-attainment areas in iowa or minnesota that impact ipl. in 2013, the epa issued a proposed rule to assist state agencies in developing sips. the sips will explain what actions and emission reductions may be required for compliance to achieve attainment. the edgewater unit 5 scr system completed in 2012 is expected to assist with possible compliance obligations under the ozone naaqs sip for wisconsin. in november 2014, the epa proposed changes to make the current ozone naaqs rule more stringent. the epa is expected to issue a final revised ozone naaqs rule in 2015. given the wisconsin dnr has not yet issued an eight-hour ozone non-attainment sip, and the 2008 standard may be revised, alliant energy and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact of the ozone naaqs rule on their financial condition and results of operations.
no2 naaqs rule - in 2010, the epa issued a final rule that establishes a new one-hour naaqs for no2. in 2012, the epa issued a final rule that does not propose to designate any non-attainment areas in iowa, wisconsin or minnesota. the epa is expected to re-evaluate these designations in 2016 based on expanded monitoring data. given that the epa has not yet re-evaluated designations, alliant energy, ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact of any potential no2 naaqs changes on their financial condition and results of operations.
51
so2 naaqs rule - in 2010, the epa issued a final rule that establishes a new one-hour naaqs for so2. in 2013, the epa finalized non-attainment designations for certain areas in the u.s. currently exceeding the so2 standard based on ambient monitoring data, including part of iowa and wisconsin; however, ipl and wpl do not operate any egus in these areas. non-attainment designations for the remainder of the u.s. have been delayed to allow for modeling and collection of additional monitoring data. a monitoring device has been installed near one of ipl's egus, which could result in this area receiving a non-attainment designation. alliant energy and ipl are currently unable to predict with certainty the outcome of such monitoring activities. in may 2014, the epa proposed a schedule for completing designations using modeled sources by december 2017 and using monitored sources by december 2020. given that this rule remains subject to legal challenges and the epa has not yet designated non-attainment areas for any areas where ipl or wpl operate egus, alliant energy, ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact of the so2 naaqs rule on their financial condition and results of operations.
ghg emissions - climate change continues to be assessed by policymakers including consideration of the appropriate actions to mitigate global warming. there is continued debate regarding the public policy response that the u.s. should adopt, involving both domestic actions and international efforts.
in 2009, the epa issued a finding that ghg emissions contribute to climate change, and therefore, threaten public health and welfare. this enabled the epa to issue rules to report and regulate ghg emissions under the authority of the caa. the epa mandatory ghg reporting rule requires sources above certain threshold levels to monitor and report emissions. the primary ghg emitted from alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's utility operations is co2 from the combustion of fossil fuels at their larger egus. emissions of ghg are reported at the facility level in co2e and include those facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of co2e annually. annual emissions reported to the epa for electric utility and natural gas distribution operations, in terms of total mass of co2e, were as follows (in millions of metric tons):
alliant energy                           ipl                           wpl
2013                           2012      2011      2013      2012      2011      2013      2012      2011

(a)   co2e emissions reported to the epa represent all emissions from the facilities operated by ipl and wpl and do not reflect their share of co-owned facilities operated by other companies.
ghg tailoring rule - in 2010, the epa issued the ghg tailoring rule, which establishes a ghg emissions threshold for major sources under the psd construction permit and title v operation permit. in june 2014, the supreme court ruled that the epa may not treat ghg emissions as "air pollutants" for determining whether a major source is required to obtain a psd or title v permit, but held that the epa can continue requiring best available control technology for ghg emissions from sources otherwise subject to review under the psd program. this rule remains subject to legal challenges and further rulemaking may also be required to update state regulations implementing the ghg tailoring rule to make the supreme court's decision effective.
clean air act section 111(d) - in june 2014, the epa issued proposed standards under section 111(d) of the caa to reduce co2 emissions from existing fossil-fueled egus. the epa's proposal is based on broad measures that can reduce co2 emissions from existing fossil-fueled egus, including making existing coal-fired egus more efficient, increasing dispatch of existing combined-cycle natural gas-fired egus, maintaining or expanding zero- or low-co2 energy resources such as renewables and nuclear, and reducing customer demand for electricity through energy efficiency programs. the state-specific goals are based on an emissions rate basis measured in pounds per net mwh. the epa is proposing a two-part goal structure: an "interim goal" that each state meets an average threshold over the period from 2020 through 2029, and a "final goal" based on a three-year rolling average that each state meets beginning in 2030.
state plans will determine the specific compliance requirements applicable to egus. each state has flexibility in determining how to achieve the goals, which can include the broad measures included by the epa as well as any other enforceable measures that the state can demonstrate will reduce co2 emissions from existing fossil-fueled egus. the epa also proposed to give states the option to convert the rate-based goal to a mass-based goal measured in tons. states can develop a state-only plan or collaborate in developing regional multi-state plans. state plans that provide details of how these guidelines are to be met would be required by june 30, 2016. if a state needs additional time and provides proper notification and explanation, the epa's proposal allows for a one-year extension to submit state-only plans and a two-year extension if a state elects to join a regional multi-state program. in august 2014, the epa's legal authority to issue the proposed standards under section 111(d) of the caa was challenged. the epa is currently expected to issue final standards in 2015. depending on the measures included in state plans for iowa and wisconsin, the expected dates for the retirement and fuel switching of certain of ipl's and wpl's coal-fired egus may be impacted by the new requirements. the implications of these new
52
requirements and the resolution of legal challenges remain highly uncertain, and as a result alliant energy, ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the final outcome of these standards, but expect that expenditures to comply with any regulations to reduce ghg emissions could be significant.
clean air act section 111(b) - in january 2014, the epa published revised proposed new source performance standards under section 111(b) of the caa for ghg emissions, which would establish co2 emissions limits for certain new fossil-fueled egus. marshalltown and wpl's proposed riverside expansion are expected to be impacted by these proposed standards and would be constructed to achieve compliance with these standards. the epa is currently expected to issue final standards in 2015.
wpl consent decree - refer to note 16(e) for discussion of a consent decree approved by the court in 2013 and wpl's obligations thereunder. the consent decree resolves a notice of violation issued by the epa in 2009 and complaints filed by the sierra club in 2010 regarding alleged air permitting violations at columbia, edgewater and nelson dewey.
other air quality matters - ipl, the epa, the state of iowa and the sierra club are in discussions regarding caa issues associated with ipl's iowa operations. alliant energy and ipl believe that they are in compliance with the caa. ipl is pursuing these discussions because ipl believes there is an opportunity to reach an agreement among the parties that avoids potential litigation and the long-term planning and operational uncertainty associated with such litigation. alliant energy and ipl believe that any agreement could contain terms similar to those seen in other epa caa settlements, including, among others, the installation of emission controls, the retirement or fuel switching of egus, compliance with specified emission rates and emission caps, beneficial environmental mitigation projects and penalties, such as those addressed by the wpl consent decree. alliant energy and ipl are currently unable to predict with certainty the outcome of these discussions and the impact on their financial condition or results of operations.
water quality -
section 316(b) of federal clean water act - in august 2014, the epa published a final rule related to section 316(b) of the federal clean water act to regulate cooling water intake structures and minimize adverse environmental impacts to fish and other aquatic life. this rule applies to existing and new cooling water intake structures at certain steam generating and manufacturing facilities. ipl and wpl have identified nine (ottumwa 1, prairie creek units 3-4, fox lake units 1 and 3, lansing unit 4, dubuque units 3-4, m.l. kapp unit 2, burlington unit 1, george neal units 3-4 and louisa unit 1) and three (columbia units 1-2, nelson dewey units 1-2 and edgewater units 3-5) generating facilities, respectively, which may be impacted by the final section 316(b) rule. compliance with this final rule will be incorporated during periodic facility permit renewal cycles, with final compliance anticipated by 2022. alliant energy, ipl and wpl have completed a preliminary assessment of the final section 316(b) rule and expect to begin generating facility studies in 2015. alliant energy, ipl and wpl do not currently believe there will be a significant impact from the epa's section 316(b) rule on their financial condition and results of operations.
effluent limitation guidelines - in 2013, the epa issued proposed effluent limitation guidelines, which would require changes to discharge limits for wastewater from steam generating facilities. ipl and wpl have identified eleven (emery units 1-3, ottumwa unit 1, prairie creek units 3-4, fox lake units 1 and 3, lansing unit 4, dubuque units 3-4, m.l. kapp unit 2, burlington unit 1, sutherland units 1 and 3, george neal units 3-4 and louisa unit 1) and four (riverside units 1-3, columbia units 1-2, nelson dewey units 1-2 and edgewater units 3-5) existing steam generating facilities, respectively, that are expected to be impacted by these guidelines. in addition, marshalltown and wpl's proposed riverside expansion are expected to be impacted by these guidelines.  compliance with these proposed guidelines would be required after july 1, 2017 but before july 1, 2022, depending on each facility's wastewater permit cycle for existing steam generating facilities and immediately upon operation for new steam generating facilities constructed after the issuance of the final guidelines. given that the epa has not yet issued final guidelines, alliant energy, ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact of these guidelines on their financial condition and results of operations, but believe the expenditures to comply with these guidelines could be significant.
hydroelectric fish passage device - in 2002, ferc issued an order requiring wpl to install a fish passage device at its prairie du sac hydro plant. wpl has been working with the fws and the wisconsin dnr on the final design for the fish passage device. in 2013, the fws initiated an environmental study of the fish passage device under the national environmental policy act, which could result in changes to the design of the fish passage device. the fws has indicated that this environmental study will be completed in 2015. in september 2014, ferc issued an order approving an extension of the project deadline to december 31, 2020. alliant energy and wpl currently believe the required capital investments and/or modifications to install the currently designed fish passage device at the facility could be approximately $15 million.

land and solid waste -
coal combustion residuals rule - in december 2014, the epa issued the final ccr rule, which regulates ccr as a non-hazardous waste. the final rule establishes minimum criteria for disposing of ccr in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds), and allows for continued operation of ash ponds if they meet certain location and performance criteria. compliance with the final rule is specific for each ash pond and landfill. individual ash ponds or landfills not meeting performance criteria must initiate corrective action or be subject to closure. the final rule includes an incentive of no further regulation for inactive ash ponds that can be closed within 36 months of the effective date of the ccr rule. ipl and wpl have nine and three existing coal ash ponds related to current and former coal-fired egus, respectively. in addition, ipl and wpl have four and two active ccr landfills, respectively. all of these ccr disposal units are subject to the final rule, which is currently anticipated to become effective in 2015. the schedule for compliance with this rule has not yet been established. alliant energy, ipl and wpl are currently evaluating the final rule to determine the full impact of the final ccr rule, including any additional aros that may need to be recognized in 2015 as a result of this rule.

legislative matters overview - various legislative developments are monitored, including those relating to energy, tax, financial and other matters. key legislative developments include the following:
ftip act - in december 2014, the ftip act was enacted. the most significant provisions of the ftip act for alliant energy, ipl and wpl relate to the extension of bonus depreciation deductions for certain expenditures for property that were incurred through december 31, 2014. as a result, alliant energy currently estimates its total bonus depreciation deductions to be claimed on its u.s. federal income tax return for calendar year 2014 will be approximately $450 million ($245 million for ipl and $190 million for wpl). for calendar year 2015, alliant energy will be allowed bonus depreciation deductions for certain expenditures incurred through december 31, 2014 and placed in service before january 1, 2016. alliant energy currently estimates its total bonus depreciation deductions to be claimed on its u.s. federal income tax return for calendar year 2015 for these expenditures will be approximately $50 million ($40 million for ipl and $10 million for wpl).
alliant energy's results of operations overview - "executive summary" provides an overview of alliant energy's 2014 and 2013 earnings and the various components of its business. additional details of alliant energy's 2014, 2013 and 2012 earnings are discussed below.
utility electric margins - electric margins are defined as electric operating revenues less electric production fuel, energy purchases and purchased electric capacity expenses. management believes that electric margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than electric operating revenues since electric production fuel, energy purchases and purchased electric capacity expenses are generally passed through to customers, and therefore, result in changes to electric operating revenues that are comparable to changes in electric production fuel, energy purchases and purchased electric capacity expenses. electric margins and mwh sales for alliant energy were as follows:

electric production fuel and energy purchases (fuel-related) cost recoveries - fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, are burned to produce electricity at egus. the cost of fossil fuels used during each period is included in electric production fuel expense. electricity is also purchased to meet customer demand and these costs are charged to energy purchases expense. the impact on electric margins of changes in electricity volumes generated from egus, changes in energy volumes purchased and changes in bulk power sales volumes generally offset.
due to ipl's cost recovery mechanisms for fuel-related costs, changes in fuel-related costs resulted in comparable changes in electric revenues, and therefore, did not have a significant impact on electric margins. wpl's cost recovery mechanism for wholesale fuel-related costs also provides for adjustments to its wholesale electric rates for changes in commodity costs, thereby mitigating impacts of changes to commodity costs on electric margins.
wpl's cost recovery mechanism for retail fuel-related costs provides deferral for amounts that fall outside an approved bandwidth of plus or minus 2%. the difference between revenue collected and actual fuel-related costs incurred within the bandwidth increase or (decrease) electric margins. wpl estimates the increase (decrease) to electric margins from amounts within the bandwidth were approximately ($5) million, $4 million and $6 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. refer to note 2 for discussion of fuel-related costs incurred by wpl that were outside the approved annual bandwidth for 2014 and 2012.
refer to "other matters - market risk sensitive instruments and positions" for further discussion of risks associated with increased fuel-related expenses on wpl's electric margins. refer to "rate matters" and note 1(g) for additional information relating to recovery mechanisms for fuel-related expenses.

2014 vs. 2013 summary - electric production fuel expense increased $13 million in 2014 primarily due to the unseasonably cold weather conditions in alliant energy's service territory in the first quarter of 2014, which resulted in higher commodity prices and increased customer demand in the first quarter of 2014. this contributed to higher miso dispatch of ipl's and wpl's egus in the first quarter of 2014. the increase in 2014 was also due to changes in the under-/over-collection of fuel-related costs at ipl. these items were partially offset by deferred fuel-related costs incurred that fell outside the approved bandwidth for 2014 at wpl, as well as lower dispatch at wpl's coal-fired egus during the third quarter of 2014, which included impacts of lower than planned coal deliveries.
energy purchases expense increased $114 million in 2014 primarily due to increased prices for electricity, partially resulting from ipl's new daec ppa and the expiration of wpl's kewaunee ppa, and increased volumes partially due to lower dispatch of wpl's coal-fired egus during the third quarter of 2014. the increase was also due to extremely cold temperatures in the first quarter of 2014 contributing to higher prices for electricity purchased by ipl and wpl from wholesale energy markets (primarily miso) for 2014.
2013 vs. 2012 summary - electric production fuel expense increased $64 million and energy purchases expense decreased $51 million in 2013. higher miso dispatch of wpl's generating facilities during 2013 compared to 2012 resulted in an increase in electric production fuel expense and a decrease in energy purchases expense for alliant energy and wpl. these changes were partially due to the riverside ppa being terminated in conjunction with wpl's acquisition of riverside in december 2012. partially offsetting the decrease in energy purchases expense for alliant energy was an increase in energy purchases expense at ipl primarily due to higher prices for electricity purchased from wholesale energy markets (primarily miso) in 2013.
purchased electric capacity expense - ppas help meet customer demand. certain of these ppas included minimum payments for ipl's and wpl's rights to electric generating capacity. the previous daec ppa expired in february 2014, the kewaunee ppa expired in december 2013 and the riverside ppa terminated in conjunction with wpl's acquisition of riverside in 2012. details of purchased electric capacity expense included in the utility electric margins table above were as follows (in millions):

$25               $217               $272
forecast - purchased electric capacity expense at alliant energy and ipl is expected to decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the expiration of the previous daec ppa in february 2014 and the new daec ppa effective february 2014 not containing minimum payments for electric generating capacity.
sales trends - retail sales volumes increased 1% in 2014 and 1% in 2013. the 2014 increase was primarily due to an increase in industrial sales at ipl and wpl due to production expansion at several customers and higher ipl co-generation customer requirements, and modest customer growth in wpl's service territory in 2014. these increases were partially offset by the impact weather conditions had on electric sales in 2014. the unseasonably cold weather conditions in ipl's and wpl's service territories in the first quarter of 2014 increased sales and the cooler than normal summer temperatures during the third quarter of 2014 decreased sales. in comparison, temperatures during the third quarter of 2013 were warmer than normal resulting in increased sales. these changes in weather conditions caused an overall decrease in residential and commercial sales in 2014 compared to 2013. the 2013 increase was due to increases in weather-normalized retail sales volumes primarily at wpl related to economic recovery and modest customer growth experienced in wpl's service territory. these increases were partially offset by the unseasonably warm weather conditions during the third quarter of 2012 and a decrease in industrial sales volumes at ipl in 2013 due to lower co-generation customer requirements.
wholesale sales volumes increased 1% in 2014 and 7% in 2013. the 2014 increase was primarily due to increases in sales to one of ipl's full-requirement wholesale customers due to production expansion partially offset by the impact of changes in sales to wpl's partial-requirement wholesale customers that have contractual options to be served by wpl, other power supply sources or the miso market. the 2013 increase was primarily due to the impact of changes in sales to wpl's partial-requirement wholesale customers.

bulk power and other revenue changes were largely due to changes in sales in the wholesale energy markets operated by miso and pjm. these changes are impacted by several factors including the availability and dispatch of alliant energy's egus and electricity demand within these wholesale energy markets. changes in bulk power and other sales revenues were largely offset by changes in fuel-related costs, and therefore, did not have a significant impact on electric margins.
refer to "rate matters" for discussion of the iub's approval of ipl's retail electric rate settlement agreement in september 2014, which includes a retail electric base rate freeze at ipl through the end of 2016. refer to note 2 for discussion of wpl's retail fuel-related rate increases effective january 1, 2014 and 2015, wpl retail rate cases including a retail electric base rate freeze at wpl through the end of 2016, ipl's electric tax benefit rider, and ipl's revenue requirement adjustment, which became effective in january 2013. refer to "other future considerations" for discussion of recent notifications provided to each of ipl and wpl to terminate certain of their wholesale power supply agreements.
forecast - alliant energy, ipl and wpl are currently expecting a modest increase in weather-normalized retail electric sales in 2015 compared to 2014.
utility gas margins - gas margins are defined as gas operating revenues less cost of gas sold. management believes that gas margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than gas operating revenues since cost of gas sold is generally passed through to customers, and therefore, results in changes to gas operating revenues that are comparable to changes in cost of gas sold. gas margins and dth sales for alliant energy were as follows:

natural gas cost recoveries - cost of gas sold increased $51 million in 2014 and $60 million in 2013. these increases were primarily due to higher retail gas volumes caused by weather discussed below. refer to note 1(g) for additional information relating to natural gas cost recoveries.
weather conditions - gas sales demand follows a seasonal pattern with an annual base load of gas and a large heating peak occurring during the winter season. hdd data is used to measure the variability of temperatures during winter months and is correlated with gas sales demand. refer to "utility electric margins" for hdd data details.

(a)   the july 2012 pscw order for wpl's 2013/2014 test period electric and gas base rate case authorized changes in energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations for 2013 and 2014. regulatory amortizations at wpl related to energy efficiency costs were $42 million, $22 million and $42 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
(b)   refer to note 3 for details of a regulatory-related credit recorded by ipl in 2013 due to decisions by the mpuc regarding recovery of costs for ipl's whispering willow - east wind project.
(c)   primarily due to the timing and extent of maintenance projects at ipl's and wpl's egus. the increase in 2013 was also due to additional operation and maintenance expenses related to riverside, which was acquired in december 2012.
(d)   primarily due to increased customer billing and customer assistance-related expenses.
(e)   primarily due to a decrease in retirement plan costs, partially offset by an increase in other employee benefits-related costs and the reversal of a previously recorded reserve related to the cash balance plan in 2013. refer to note 12(a) for details of the cash balance plan reserve.
(f)   changes in expense related to coal sales at wpl were largely offset by changes in coal sales revenue at wpl.
(g)   primarily due to increases in other administrative and general and distribution system expenses.
(h)   performance-based compensation expense is largely based on the achievement of specific operational and financial performance measures compared to targets established within the performance-based compensation plans.
60
(i)   primarily due to increased maintenance of the electric and gas distribution systems at ipl and wpl.
(j)   higher bad debt expense at ipl in 2013 was largely due to increases in past due accounts receivable during 2013.
(k)   refer to notes 2 and 3 for details of regulatory-related charges and credits recognized in 2012.
(l)   corporate services bills ipl and wpl cost of capital charges in accordance with a service agreement. the 2013 increase was primarily due to increased property additions at corporate services in 2013.
(m)   resulting from the amortization of capacity rights related to a ppa with a third party for the sale of a portion of riverside's capacity wpl assumed with the acquisition of riverside. the ppa expired in may 2014. these amortization expenses were largely offset by capacity revenues included in utility other revenues.
forecast - alliant energy currently expects its other operation and maintenance expenses to decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to decreases in energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations approved by the pscw in a july 2014 order, partially offset by expected increases in retirement plan costs in 2015 compared to 2014, resulting from decreases in discount rates and a change to the life expectancy assumption.
depreciation and amortization expenses -
2014 vs. 2013 summary - depreciation and amortization expenses increased $17 million in 2014 primarily due to increased property additions, including various emission controls projects at ipl and wpl placed in service in the second half of 2013 and in 2014.
2013 vs. 2012 summary - depreciation and amortization expenses increased $39 million in 2013 primarily due to depreciation expense at wpl related to riverside, wpl's scr project at edgewater unit 5, which was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2012, new depreciation rates implemented by wpl effective january 2013, and depreciation expense at the franklin county wind project, which was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2012.
forecast - alliant energy currently expects its depreciation and amortization expenses to increase in 2015 compared to 2014 due to property additions, including various emission controls projects at ipl and wpl placed in service in 2014 and expected to be placed in service in 2015.
interest expense -
2014 vs. 2013 summary - interest expense increased $8 million in 2014 primarily due to $9 million of higher interest expense recorded in 2014 compared to 2013 for ipl's $250 million 4.7% senior debentures issued in october 2013.
2013 vs. 2012 summary - interest expense increased $16 million in 2013 primarily due to $6 million of capitalized interest recognized in 2012 for the franklin county wind project, $5 million of higher interest expense recorded in 2013 compared to 2012 for wpl's 2.25% debentures issued in november 2012 to fund a portion of the purchase price of riverside and $3 million of interest expense recorded in 2013 for ipl's 4.7% senior debentures issued in october 2013.

forecast - alliant energy currently expects its interest expense to increase in 2015 compared to 2014 due to financings in 2014 and 2015. refer to note 9 for additional details of financings in 2014 and "liquidity and capital resources" for details of alliant energy's financings anticipated in 2015.
afudc -
2014 vs. 2013 summary - afudc increased $4 million in 2014 primarily due to increased cwip balances related to ipl's marshalltown and changes in afudc recognized for ipl's and wpl's emission controls projects.
2013 vs. 2012 summary - afudc increased $9 million in 2013 primarily due to changes in afudc recognized for ipl's and wpl's emission controls projects.
refer to note 3 for additional details of afudc recognized in 2014, 2013 and 2012.
forecast - alliant energy currently expects afudc to increase in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to increased cwip balances related to marshalltown.

61
forecast - alliant energy currently expects to record lower tax benefits from the effect of rate-making on property-related differences in 2015 compared to 2014 and lower tax benefits from the impacts of the electric tax benefit rider due to lower billing credits on iowa retail electric customers' bills expected in 2015 compared to 2014.
loss from discontinued operations, net of tax - refer to note 19 for discussion of discontinued operations.
preferred dividend requirements of subsidiaries - preferred dividend requirements of subsidiaries decreased $8 million in 2014 and increased $2 million in 2013 primarily due to ipl and wpl recording charges of $5 million and $1 million in 2013, respectively, related to the redemption of preferred stock. refer to note 8 for additional discussion of ipl's and wpl's preferred stock transactions.
ipl's results of operations overview - earnings available for common stock increased $11 million in 2014 and $36 million in 2013. the 2014 increase was the result of lower purchased electric capacity expense related to the previous daec ppa and higher income tax benefits. these items were partially offset by electric customer billing credits related to a rate case settlement approved in 2014, lower retail electric sales due to changes in weather conditions in ipl's service territory and higher interest, depreciation and other operation and maintenance expenses. the 2013 increase was primarily due to higher electric revenues from the revenue requirement adjustment related to certain tax benefits from tax accounting method changes, which became effective in january 2013, higher afudc in 2013 for ipl's emission controls projects, higher income tax benefits and higher gas revenues from increased sales and a rate increase implemented in january 2013. these items were partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses.

alliant energy, ipl and wpl intend to manage their capital structures and liquidity positions in such a way that facilitates their ability to raise the necessary funds reliably and on reasonable terms and conditions, while maintaining financial capital structures consistent with those approved by regulators and necessary to maintain appropriate credit quality. in addition to capital structures, other important financial considerations used to determine the characteristics of future financings include anticipated proceeds from asset sales, financial coverage ratios, capital spending plans, regulatory orders and rate-making considerations, levels of debt imputed by rating agencies, market conditions and the impact of tax initiatives and legislation. the most significant debt imputations relate to the sales of accounts receivable program, the daec ppa, and pension and opeb obligations. the pscw factors certain imputed debt adjustments in establishing a regulatory capital structure as part of wpl's retail rate cases. the iub and mpuc do not make any explicit adjustments for imputed debt in establishing capital ratios used in determining customer rates, although such adjustments are considered by ipl in recommending an appropriate capital structure.
credit and capital markets - alliant energy, ipl and wpl are aware of the potential implications that credit and capital market disruptions might have on the ability to raise external funding required for their respective operations and capital expenditure plans. alliant energy, ipl and wpl maintain revolving credit facilities to provide backstop liquidity to their commercial paper programs, ensure a committed source of liquidity in the event the commercial paper market becomes disrupted and efficiently manage their long-term financings. in addition, alliant energy and ipl maintain a sales of accounts receivable program at ipl as an alternative financing source.
primary sources and uses of cash - the most significant source of cash is from electric and gas sales to ipl's and wpl's customers. cash from these sales reimburses ipl and wpl for prudently-incurred expenses to provide service to their utility customers and provides ipl and wpl a return of and a return on the assets used to provide such services. utility operating cash flows are expected to cover the majority of ipl's and wpl's capital expenditures required to maintain their current infrastructure and to pay dividends to alliant energy's shareowners. capital needed to retire debt and fund capital expenditures related to large strategic projects is expected to be met primarily through external financings.

operating activities -
2014 vs. 2013 - alliant energy's cash flows from operating activities increased $161 million primarily due to $190 million of lower purchased electric capacity payments in 2014 compared to 2013 related to the previous daec ppa and the kewaunee ppa, $94 million of higher cash flows from changes in the level of ipl's accounts receivable sold during 2014 and 2013, and the final receipt of $26 million related to alliant energy's tax separation and indemnification agreement with whiting petroleum in 2014. these items were partially offset by $72 million of retail electric customer base rate freeze billing credits at ipl in 2014, higher fuel-related costs at wpl in 2014 compared to 2013, and lower cash flows from increases in inventory levels of gas stored underground at ipl and wpl during 2014. refer to notes 5(b) and 5(c) for discussion of ipl's sale of accounts receivable program and the tax separation and indemnification agreement with whiting petroleum, respectively. refer to "rate matters" for further discussion of ipl's retail electric customer base rate freeze billing credits. refer to note 2 for discussion of wpl's under-collection of fuel-related costs during 2014.
ipl's cash flows from operating activities increased $174 million primarily due to $129 million of lower purchased electric capacity payments in 2014 compared to 2013 related to the previous daec ppa and $94 million of higher cash flows from changes in the level of accounts receivable sold during 2014 and 2013. these items were partially offset by $72 million of retail electric customer base rate freeze billing credits in 2014.
wpl's cash flows from operating activities increased $1 million primarily due to $61 million of purchased electric capacity payments in 2013 related to the kewaunee ppa. this item was substantially offset by lower cash flows from higher fuel-related costs in 2014 compared to 2013 and lower cash flows from increases in inventory levels of gas stored underground.
2013 vs. 2012 - alliant energy's cash flows from operating activities decreased $110 million primarily due to $91 million of lower cash flows from changes in the level of ipl's accounts receivable sold during 2013 and 2012, $63 million of cash flows from operations at rmt in 2012 due to changes in working capital requirements associated with renewable energy projects, lower cash flows from changes in prepaid gas and inventory levels of gas stored underground at ipl and wpl, and refunds paid by wpl to its retail electric customers during 2013 for over-collected fuel-related costs during 2012. these items were partially offset by $59 million of purchased electric capacity payments by wpl in 2012 related to the riverside ppa, and the timing of electric fuel-related, natural gas and transmission cost recoveries at ipl.
ipl's cash flows from operating activities decreased $58 million primarily due to $91 million of lower cash flows from changes in the level of accounts receivable sold in 2013 compared to 2012 and lower cash flows from changes in prepaid gas and inventory levels of gas stored underground. these items were partially offset by the timing of electric fuel-related, natural gas and transmission cost recoveries.
wpl's cash flows from operating activities decreased $4 million primarily due to $26 million of lower cash flows caused by income tax payments in 2013 and income tax refunds in 2012, refunds paid by wpl to its retail electric customers during 2013 for over-collected fuel-related costs during 2012, and lower cash flows from changes in prepaid gas and inventory levels of gas stored underground. these items were largely offset by $59 million of purchased electric capacity payments in 2012 related to the riverside ppa.
electric fuel-related, natural gas and transmission cost recoveries - ipl has cost recovery mechanisms applicable for its retail electric and gas customers to provide for subsequent adjustments to its electric and gas rates for changes in electric fuel-related and natural gas costs. ipl also has a cost recovery mechanism applicable for its iowa retail electric customers to provide for subsequent adjustments to its electric rates for changes in electric transmission service expense. changes in the timing of ipl's electric fuel-related, natural gas and transmission cost recoveries resulted in $47 million of higher cash flows from operations for alliant energy and ipl in 2013 compared to 2012.
income tax payments and refunds - income tax (payments) refunds were as follows (in millions):

alliant energy's income tax refunds in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to federal and state claims filed related to net operating losses carried back to prior years. alliant energy, ipl and wpl currently do not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2017 based on their current federal net operating loss and credit carryforward positions
68
and future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be claimed on alliant energy's u.s. federal income tax returns for calendar years 2014 and 2015. while no significant federal income tax payments through 2017 are expected to occur, some tax payments and refunds may occur between consolidated group members (including ipl and wpl) under the tax sharing agreement between alliant energy and its subsidiaries. refer to note 11 for discussion of the carryforward positions.
pension plan contributions - alliant energy, ipl and wpl currently do not expect to make any significant pension plan contributions in 2015 through 2018 based on the funded status and assumed return on assets for each plan as of the december 31, 2014 measurement date. refer to note 12(a) for discussion of the current funded levels of pension plans.
investing activities -
2014 vs. 2013 - alliant energy's cash flows used for investing activities increased $163 million primarily due to $107 million of higher utility construction expenditures and a $62 million cash grant alliant energy received in 2013 related to the franklin county wind project. the higher utility construction expenditures were largely due to higher expenditures for marshalltown, ipl's and wpl's electric and gas distribution systems and emission controls projects at wpl's edgewater unit 5 in 2014, partially offset by lower expenditures for emission controls projects at wpl's columbia units 1 and 2 in 2014. refer to note 5(d) for further discussion of the franklin county wind project cash grant.
ipl's cash flows used for investing activities increased $129 million due to $126 million of higher construction expenditures. the higher construction expenditures were largely due to higher expenditures for marshalltown and the electric and gas distribution systems in 2014.
wpl's cash flows used for investing activities decreased $16 million primarily due to $19 million of lower construction expenditures. the lower construction expenditures were largely due to lower expenditures for emission controls projects at columbia units 1 and 2 in 2014, partially offset by higher expenditures for emission controls projects at edgewater unit 5 and the electric and gas distribution systems in 2014.
2013 vs. 2012 - alliant energy's cash flows used for investing activities decreased $401 million primarily due to $294 million of lower utility construction and acquisition expenditures, a $62 million cash grant alliant energy received during 2013 related to the franklin county wind project, and expenditures in 2012 for the franklin county wind project and corporate services' purchase of its corporate headquarters building. the lower utility construction and acquisition expenditures were largely due to expenditures for wpl's purchase of riverside in 2012 and for emission controls projects at wpl's edgewater unit 5 in 2012, partially offset by higher expenditures in 2013 for the emission controls projects at wpl's columbia units 1 and 2, and ipl's george neal units 3 and 4 and lansing unit 4.
ipl's cash flows used for investing activities increased $92 million due to $93 million of higher construction expenditures. the higher construction expenditures were largely due to higher expenditures in 2013 for emission controls projects at george neal units 3 and 4 and lansing unit 4.
wpl's cash flows used for investing activities decreased $374 million primarily due to $387 million of lower construction and acquisition expenditures. the lower construction and acquisition expenditures resulted from expenditures in 2012 for the purchase of riverside and emission controls projects at edgewater unit 5. these items were partially offset by higher expenditures in 2013 for emission controls projects at columbia units 1 and 2.
construction and acquisition expenditures - capital expenditures and financing plans are reviewed, approved and updated as part of the financial planning processes. changes in anticipated construction and acquisition expenditures may result from a number of reasons including economic conditions, regulatory requirements, changing legislation, ability to obtain adequate and timely rate relief, improvements in technology, failure of generating facilities, changing market conditions, customer and sales growth, funding of pension and opeb plans, and new opportunities. alliant energy, ipl and wpl have not yet entered into contractual commitments relating to the majority of their anticipated future capital expenditures. as a result, they have some discretion with regard to the level and timing of capital expenditures. construction and acquisition expenditures are currently anticipated as follows (in millions):

atc - wpl transco's capital contributions to atc are currently funded by ati, and are included in "corporate services and other non-utility" in the table above. alliant energy currently anticipates that ati will fund capital contributions of approximately $8 million, $19 million, $22 million and $4 million to atc in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, to help fund future proposed transmission projects. these future proposed transmission projects require approval from various regulatory agencies to construct. certain of these future proposed transmission projects are currently being challenged by other utilities and other transmission-only companies who have requested to own a portion of the future transmission projects proposed by atc. alliant energy and wpl are currently unable to determine the impact these challenges may have on atc's plans to construct these proposed transmission projects and the resulting impact on ati's future capital contributions to atc and wpl's and ati's equity earnings income and dividends received from atc.
in 2011, duke energy corporation and atc announced the creation of duke-american transmission co., a joint venture that is expected to build, own and operate new electric transmission infrastructure in north america. duke-american transmission co. has announced construction of several new transmission lines over the next decade for an aggregate cost of approximately $4 billion. these transmission projects are subject to approval by various regulatory agencies. alliant energy and wpl are currently unable to determine what impacts the joint venture and transmission line projects noted above, if constructed, will have on their future equity income, distributions from atc, capital contributions to atc, or ownership in atc. the capital expenditures in the above table do not include any capital contributions for the potential duke-american transmission co. projects.

ferc and public utility holding company act financing authorizations - under the public utility holding company act of 2005, ferc has authority over the issuance of utility securities, except to the extent that a public utility's primary state regulatory commission has retained jurisdiction over such matters. ferc currently has authority over the issuance of securities by ipl. ferc does not have authority over the issuance of securities by alliant energy, wpl, resources or corporate services.
in 2013, ipl received authorization from ferc through december 31, 2015 for the following (in millions):
initial authorization             current remaining authority long-term debt securities issuances in aggregate                                                         $750                                  $500

state regulatory financing authorizations - in 2011, wpl received authorization from the pscw to have up to $400 million of short-term borrowings and/or letters of credit outstanding at any time through december 2018. in november 2014, wpl received authorization from the pscw to issue up to $500 million of long-term debt securities during 2015 and 2016, with no more than $300 million to be issued in either year.
in 2010, the mpuc issued an order that determined ipl does not need to obtain authorization to issue securities as long as ipl is not organized under the laws of the state of minnesota and the securities issued do not encumber any of its property in the state of minnesota. ipl currently does not have, and does not plan to issue, securities that encumber such property, thus ipl is not currently required to obtain approval from the mpuc for unsecured securities issuances. however, if in the future ipl were to subject its utility property in minnesota to an encumbrance for the purpose of securing the payment of any indebtedness, ipl would be required to obtain an order from the mpuc approving such securities issuances.
shelf registrations - alliant energy, ipl and wpl have current shelf registration statements on file with the sec for availability to issue unspecified amounts of securities through december 2017. alliant energy's shelf registration statement may be used to issue common stock, debt and other securities. ipl's and wpl's shelf registration statements may be used to issue preferred stock and debt securities.
common stock dividends - payment of common stock dividends is subject to dividend declaration by alliant energy's board of directors. alliant energy's general long-term goal is to maintain a dividend payout ratio that is competitive with the industry average. based on that, alliant energy's goal is to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately 60% to 70% of consolidated earnings from continuing operations. ipl's and wpl's goal is to maintain dividend payout ratios of approximately 65% to 75%. alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's dividend payout ratios were 59%, 76% and 66% of their consolidated earnings from continuing operations in 2014, respectively. refer to "financing forecast" below for discussion

of expected common stock dividends in 2015. refer to note 7 for discussion of ipl's and wpl's dividend payment restrictions based on the terms of applicable regulatory limitations and ipl's outstanding preferred stock.
common stock issuances and capital contributions - alliant energy issued a modest amount of additional common stock in 2012 through 2014 under its equity-based compensation plans for employees. refer to "financing forecast" below for discussion of expected issuances of common stock and capital contributions in 2015. refer to note 7 for discussion of capital contributions from alliant energy to each of ipl, wpl and corporate services; payments of common stock dividends by ipl and wpl to their parent company; and repayments of capital by resources to its parent company.
preferred stock issuance and redemptions - refer to note 8 for discussion of ipl's and wpl's preferred stock redemptions and ipl's issuance of preferred stock in 2013.
short-term debt - alliant energy, ipl and wpl maintain committed revolving credit facilities to provide short-term borrowing flexibility and backstop liquidity for commercial paper outstanding. at december 31, 2014, alliant energy's short-term borrowing arrangements included three revolving credit facilities totaling $1 billion ($300 million for alliant energy at the parent company level, $300 million for ipl and $400 million for wpl). there are currently 13 lenders that participate in the three credit facilities, with aggregate respective commitments ranging from $10 million to $135 million. in 2014, each of the credit facilities was extended one year through december 2018. there are currently no extension renewal provisions remaining for the credit facilities. each of the credit facilities has a provision to expand the facility size up to $100 million, subject to lender approval for alliant energy and ipl, and subject to lender and regulatory approvals for wpl. during 2014, the alliant energy parent company, ipl and wpl issued commercial paper to meet short-term financing requirements and did not borrow directly under their respective credit facilities.
alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's credit facility agreements each contain a financial covenant, which requires the entities to maintain certain debt-to-capital ratios in order to borrow under the credit facilities. the debt-to-capital ratios cannot exceed 65%, 58% and 58% for alliant energy, ipl and wpl, respectively. the debt component of the capital ratios includes long- and short-term debt (excluding non-recourse debt and hybrid securities to the extent the total carrying value of such hybrid securities does not exceed 15% of consolidated capital of the applicable borrower), capital lease obligations, letters of credit, guarantees of the foregoing and new synthetic leases. unfunded vested benefits under qualified pension plans and sales of accounts receivable are not included in the debt-to-capital ratios. the equity component of the capital ratios excludes accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
the credit agreements contain provisions that prohibit placing liens on any of alliant energy's, ipl's or wpl's property or their respective subsidiaries with certain exceptions. exceptions include among others, liens to secure obligations of up to 5% of the consolidated assets of the applicable borrower (valued at carrying value), liens imposed by government entities, materialmens' and similar liens, judgment liens, and liens to secure additional non-recourse debt not to exceed $100 million outstanding at any one time at each of ipl and wpl, and $100 million at alliant energy's non-utility subsidiaries, and purchase money liens.
the credit agreements contain provisions that require, during their term, any proceeds from asset sales, with certain exclusions, in excess of 20% of alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's respective consolidated assets be used to reduce commitments under their respective facilities. exclusions include, among others, certain sale and lease-back transactions and sales of non-regulated assets and accounts receivable.
the credit agreements contain customary events of default. alliant energy's credit agreement contains a cross-default provision that would be triggered if alliant energy or any domestic, majority-owned subsidiary of alliant energy defaults on debt (other than non-recourse debt) totaling $50 million or more. accordingly, a cross-default provision would be triggered under the alliant energy credit agreement if ipl or wpl, as applicable, or a majority-owned subsidiary accounting for 20% or more of ipl's or wpl's, as applicable, consolidated assets (valued at carrying value), defaults on debt totaling $50 million or more. a default by a minority-owned subsidiary and, in the case of the alliant energy credit agreement, a default by a foreign subsidiary, would not trigger a cross-default. a default by alliant energy, corporate services or resources and its subsidiaries would not trigger a cross-default under either the ipl or wpl credit agreements, nor would a default by either of ipl or wpl constitute a cross-default event for the other. if an event of default under any of the credit agreements occurs and is continuing, then the lenders may declare any outstanding obligations under the credit agreements immediately due and payable. in addition, if any order for relief is entered under bankruptcy laws with respect to alliant energy, ipl or wpl, then any outstanding obligations under the respective credit agreements would be immediately due and payable. in addition, ipl's sales of accounts receivable program agreement contains a cross-default provision that is triggered if ipl or alliant energy incurs an event of default on debt totaling $50 million or more. if an event of default under ipl's sales of accounts
72
receivable program agreement occurs, then the counterparty could terminate such agreement. refer to note 5(b) for additional information on amounts outstanding under ipl's sales of accounts receivable program.
a material adverse change representation is not required for borrowings under the credit agreements.
at december 31, 2014, alliant energy, ipl and wpl were in compliance with all material covenants and other provisions of the credit agreements.
refer to note 9(a) for additional information on the credit facilities, commercial paper outstanding and debt-to-capital ratios.

financing forecast - the following financing activities are currently anticipated to occur in the future. the financing activities of alliant energy and ipl are contingent on the completion of the sale of ipl's minnesota electric and natural gas distribution assets in 2015.
•   long-term debt - ipl currently expects to issue up to $300 million of additional long-term debt in 2015. ipl's $150 million, 3.3% senior debentures mature in 2015.
•   common stock issuances and capital contributions - alliant energy currently expects to issue approximately $150 million of common stock in 2015 through one or more offerings and its shareowner direct plan. ipl currently expects to receive capital contributions of $175 million from its parent company in 2015.
•   common stock dividends - in november 2014, alliant energy announced an increase in its targeted 2015 annual common stock dividend to $2.20 per share, which is equivalent to a quarterly rate of $0.55 per share, beginning with the february 2015 dividend payment. the timing and amount of future dividends is subject to an approved dividend declaration from its board of directors, and is dependent upon earnings expectations, capital requirements, and general financial business conditions, among other factors. in addition, ipl and wpl currently expect to pay common stock dividends of approximately $140 million and $127 million, respectively, to their parent company in 2015.
impact of credit ratings on liquidity and collateral obligations -
ratings triggers - the long-term debt of alliant energy and its subsidiaries is not subject to any repayment requirements as a result of explicit credit rating downgrades or so-called "ratings triggers." however, alliant energy and its subsidiaries are parties to various agreements that contain provisions dependent on credit ratings. in the event of a significant downgrade, alliant energy or its subsidiaries may need to provide credit support, such as letters of credit or cash collateral equal to the amount of the exposure, or may need to unwind the contract or pay the underlying obligation. in the event of a significant downgrade, management believes alliant energy, ipl and wpl have sufficient liquidity to cover counterparty credit support or collateral requirements under these various agreements. in addition, a downgrade in the credit ratings of alliant energy, ipl or wpl could also result in them paying higher interest rates in future financings, reduce their pool of potential lenders, increase their borrowing costs under existing credit facilities or limit their access to the commercial paper market. alliant energy, ipl and wpl are committed to taking the necessary steps required to maintain investment-grade credit ratings. credit ratings and outlooks as of the date of this report are as follows:

(a)   purchased power and fuel commitments represent normal business contracts used to ensure adequate purchased power, coal and natural gas supplies, and to minimize exposure to market price fluctuations. alliant energy, through its subsidiary corporate services, entered into system-wide coal contracts on behalf of ipl and wpl that include minimum future commitments. these commitments were assigned to ipl and wpl based on information available as of december 31, 2014 regarding expected future usage, which is subject to change.
(b)   other operating expense purchase obligations represent individual commitments incurred during the normal course of business that exceeded $1 million at december 31, 2014.
at december 31, 2014, alliant energy, ipl and wpl had no uncertain tax positions recorded as liabilities. refer to note 12(a) for anticipated pension and opeb funding amounts, which are not included in the above tables. refer to "construction and acquisition expenditures" above for additional information on construction and acquisition programs. in addition, at december 31, 2014, there were various other liabilities included on the balance sheets that, due to the nature of the liabilities, the timing of payments cannot be estimated and are therefore excluded from the above tables.

other matters market risk sensitive instruments and positions - primary market risk exposures are associated with commodity prices, investment prices and interest rates. risk management policies are used to monitor and assist in mitigating these market risks and derivative instruments are used to manage some of the exposures related to commodity prices. refer to notes 1(h) and 15 for further discussion of derivative instruments.
commodity price - alliant energy, ipl and wpl are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of commodities they procure and market. established policies and procedures mitigate risks associated with these market fluctuations, including the use of various commodity derivatives and contracts of various durations for the forward sale and purchase of these commodities. exposure to commodity price risks in the utility businesses is also significantly mitigated by current rate-making structures in place for recovery of fuel-related costs as well as the cost of natural gas purchased for resale. ipl's electric and gas tariffs and wpl's wholesale electric and gas tariffs provide for subsequent monthly adjustments to their tariff rates for material changes in prudently incurred commodity costs. ipl's and wpl's rate mechanisms, combined with commodity derivatives, significantly reduce commodity risk associated with their electric and gas margins.
wpl's retail electric margins have the most exposure to the impact of changes in commodity prices due largely to the current retail recovery mechanism in place in wisconsin for fuel-related costs. the cost recovery mechanism applicable for wpl's retail electric customers is based on forecasts of fuel-related costs expected to be incurred during forward-looking test year periods and fuel monitoring ranges determined by the pscw during each retail electric rate proceeding or in a separate fuel cost plan approval proceeding. under this cost recovery mechanism, if wpl's actual fuel-related costs fall outside this fuel monitoring range during the test period, wpl is authorized to defer the incremental under-/over-collection of fuel-related costs from retail electric customers that are outside the approved ranges. deferral of under-collection of fuel-related costs are reduced to the extent wpl's return on common equity during the fuel cost plan year exceeds the most recently authorized return on common equity. refer to note 2 for discussion of amounts recorded by alliant energy and wpl on their balance sheets as of december 31, 2014 for fuel-related costs incurred by wpl during 2014 that fell outside the approved bandwidth for 2014.
in december 2014, the pscw approved annual forecasted fuel-related costs per mwh of $28.00 based on $386 million of variable fuel-related costs applicable for retail and wholesale customers for wpl's 2015 test period. the retail portion of the 2015 fuel-related costs will be monitored using an annual bandwidth of plus or minus 2%. based on the cost recovery mechanism in wisconsin, the annual forecasted fuel-related costs approved by the pscw in december 2014 and an annual bandwidth of plus or minus 2%, alliant energy and wpl currently estimate the commodity risk exposure to their retail electric margins in 2015 is approximately $6 million. however, if wpl's return on common equity in 2015 exceeds the most recently authorized return on common equity, the commodity risk exposure to wpl's electric margins in 2015 could increase.
refer to note 1(g) for additional details of utility cost recovery mechanisms that significantly reduce commodity risk.
investment price - alliant energy, ipl and wpl are exposed to investment price risk as a result of their investments in securities, largely related to securities held by their pension and opeb plans. refer to note 12(a) for details of the securities held by their pension and opeb plans. refer to "critical accounting policies and estimates" for the impact on retirement plan costs of changes in the rate of returns earned by plan assets.
interest rate - alliant energy, ipl and wpl are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates when issuing variable-rate borrowings. in addition, alliant energy and ipl are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of cash proceeds outstanding under ipl's sales of accounts receivable program. assuming the impact of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates on variable-rate borrowings and cash proceeds outstanding under ipl's sales of accounts receivable program at december 31, 2014, alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's annual pre-tax expense would increase by approximately $5 million, $0 and $0, respectively.
refer to notes 5(b) and 9 for additional information on cash proceeds outstanding under ipl's sales of accounts receivable program, and short- and long-term variable-rate borrowings, respectively. refer to "critical accounting policies and estimates" for the impacts of changes in discount rates on retirement plan obligations and costs.
new accounting pronouncements - refer to note 1(p) for discussion of new accounting pronouncements impacting alliant energy, ipl and wpl.
76
critical accounting policies and estimates - the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to the business and the understanding of financial results as they require critical assumptions and judgments by management. the results of these assumptions and judgments form the basis for making estimates regarding the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual financial results may differ materially from these estimates. management has discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee. refer to note 1 for additional discussion of accounting policies and the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.
contingencies - assumptions and judgments are made each reporting period regarding the future outcome of contingent events and loss contingency amounts are recorded for any contingent events that are both probable and able to be reasonably estimated based upon current available information. the amounts recorded may differ from the actual income or expense that occurs when the uncertainty is resolved. the estimates made in accounting for contingencies, and the gains and losses that are recorded upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties, could have a significant effect on results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements. note 16 provides discussion of contingencies assessed at december 31, 2014, including various pending legal proceedings, guarantees and indemnifications that may have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations.
regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities - alliant energy's utility subsidiaries (ipl and wpl) are regulated by various federal and state regulatory agencies. as a result, they are subject to gaap for regulated operations, which recognizes that the actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or liability. regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities arise as a result of a difference between gaap and actions imposed by the regulatory agencies in the rate-making process. regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred as such costs are probable of recovery in future customer rates. regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers or amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred. regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recognized in accordance with the rulings of applicable federal and state regulators, and future regulatory rulings may impact the carrying value and accounting treatment of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities.
assumptions and judgments are made each reporting period regarding whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery and regulatory liabilities are probable future obligations by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes, rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory agencies and historical decisions by such regulatory agencies regarding similar regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities. the decisions made by regulatory authorities have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. a change in these decisions may result in a material impact on results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements. note 2 provides details of the nature and amounts of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities assessed at december 31, 2014 as well as material changes to regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities during 2014.
long-lived assets - periodic assessments regarding the recoverability of certain long-lived assets are completed when factors indicate the carrying value of such assets may be impaired or such assets are planned to be sold. these assessments require significant assumptions and judgments by management. the long-lived assets assessed for impairment generally include assets within non-regulated operations that are proposed to be sold or are currently generating operating losses, and certain long-lived assets within regulated operations that may not be fully recovered from ipl's and wpl's customers as a result of regulatory decisions in the future.
non-regulated operations - factors considered in determining if an impairment review is necessary for long-lived assets within non-regulated operations include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant change in the use of the acquired assets or business strategy related to such assets, and significant negative industry, regulatory or economic trends. when an impairment review is deemed necessary, a comparison is made between the expected undiscounted future cash flows and the carrying amount of the asset. if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. the fair value is determined by the use of quoted market prices, appraisals, or the use of valuation techniques such as expected discounted future cash flows. long-lived assets within non-regulated operations assessed for impairment indicators in 2014 included the franklin county wind project for alliant energy and a wind site currently expected to be used to develop a future wind project for alliant energy and ipl.
77
franklin county wind project - alliant energy completed construction of its 99 mw franklin county wind project and placed it into service in 2012. in 2012, alliant energy performed an impairment test of the carrying value of the franklin county wind project given a significant change in the use of the asset as a result of it being placed into service, continued downturn in forward electricity prices in 2012 and no long-term off-take arrangement. the test concluded the undiscounted cash flows expected from the franklin county wind project during its estimated useful life exceeded its carrying value as of december 31, 2012, resulting in no impairment. on a quarterly basis, alliant energy evaluates for significant changes in the undiscounted cash flows used in the 2012 impairment test, which may indicate a significant decrease in the market value of the franklin county wind project. no significant decrease in the undiscounted cash flows have been identified, and as a result, an impairment test has not been required since 2012. future changes in the estimated cash flows could result in the undiscounted cash flows being less than the carrying amount and a future material impairment could be required. primary factors that could have an effect on the future expected cash flows for the project include the price of electricity generated from the project during its useful life, the volume of electricity generated, transmission constraints impacting the project, the expected life of the project, probability of selling the wind project, and changes in anticipated operation and maintenance expenses and capital expenditures, including replacement of key turbine components throughout the life of the project. the expected output of the project is, in part, based on transmission upgrades being completed in the next few years. the expected output of the project could be significantly lower if the transmission upgrades are not completed or if the level of congestion reduction is lower than expected. an impairment of the franklin county wind project could be triggered in the future if long-term electricity prices stay at current levels or decline, or if the expected output or life of the project is significantly reduced. as of december 31, 2014, the carrying value of the franklin county wind project was $137 million and was recorded in "property, plant and equipment, net" on alliant energy's balance sheet. note 3 provides additional discussion of the franklin county wind project.
undeveloped wind site - as of december 31, 2014, alliant energy and ipl have an undeveloped wind site with capitalized costs of $13 million related to ipl's wind site capacity in franklin county, iowa of up to 400 mw. alliant energy and ipl assessed the recoverability of this undeveloped wind site given the long-term period projected until the site is expected to be utilized and concluded no impairment test was required in 2014. changes in the future use of this undeveloped wind site could result in a future impairment. the future utilization of this undeveloped wind site is dependent on the future demand of wind energy in the region where the wind site is located. such future wind energy demand is dependent on various factors including future government incentives for wind projects, energy policy and legislation including federal and state renewable energy standards and regulation of carbon emissions, electricity and fossil fuel prices, transmission constraints in the region where the wind site is located and further technological advancements for wind generation. alliant energy and ipl currently believe, based on a combination of the various factors, further wind development in the region where the wind site is located will occur. alliant energy and ipl could realize an impairment related to this wind site if one or more of these factors are no longer expected to occur, or actions by regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over ipl indicate the costs of the undeveloped wind site would not be approved to be recovered from customers.
regulated operations - long-lived assets within regulated operations are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate all or a portion of the carrying value of the assets may be disallowed for rate-making purposes. if ipl or wpl is disallowed recovery of any portion of the carrying value of its regulated property, plant and equipment that has been recently completed or is probable of being retired early, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount of the carrying value that was disallowed recovery. if ipl or wpl is disallowed a full or partial return on the carrying value of its regulated property, plant and equipment that has been recently completed or is probable of being retired early, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of the future revenues expected from its regulated property, plant and equipment. alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's long-lived assets within their regulated operations that were assessed for impairment in 2014 included ipl's and wpl's generating units subject to early retirement.
generating units subject to early retirement - due to current and proposed environmental regulations, alliant energy, ipl and wpl are evaluating future plans for their electric generation fleet and have announced the early retirement of certain older and less-efficient egus. when it becomes probable that an egu will be retired before the end of its useful life, alliant energy, ipl and wpl must assess whether the egu meets the criteria to be considered probable of abandonment. egus that are considered probable of abandonment generally have material remaining net book values and are expected to cease operations in the near term significantly before the end of their original estimated useful lives. if an egu meets such criteria to be considered probable of abandonment, alliant energy, ipl and wpl must assess the probability of full recovery of the remaining carrying value of such egu. if it is probable that regulators will not allow full recovery of and a full return on the remaining carrying amount of the abandoned egu, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the difference between the remaining carrying value and the present value of the future revenues expected from the abandoned egu. alliant energy, ipl and wpl evaluated their egus that are subject to early retirement and determined that edgewater unit 3 and nelson
78
dewey units 1 and 2 met the criteria to be considered probable of abandonment as of december 31, 2014. alliant energy and wpl concluded that no impairment was required as of december 31, 2014 for edgewater unit 3 and nelson dewey units 1 and 2 given that wpl is recovering the remaining net book value of these egus over a 10-year period beginning january 1, 2013 pursuant to a pscw order issued in 2012. refer to note 3 for additional details of the egus considered probable of abandonment as of december 31, 2014. refer to "strategic overview" for discussion of additional egus that may be considered probable of abandonment in future periods, along with the aggregate net book value of such egus.
unbilled revenues - unbilled revenues are primarily associated with utility operations. energy sales to individual customers are based on the reading of customers' meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated at the end of each reporting period and the corresponding estimated unbilled revenue is recorded. the unbilled revenue estimate is based on daily system demand volumes, estimated customer usage by class, weather impacts, line losses and the most recent customer rates. such process involves the use of various judgments and assumptions and significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on results of operations. as of december 31, 2014, unbilled revenues related to alliant energy's utility operations were $155 million ($70 million at ipl and $85 million at wpl). note 5(b) provides discussion of ipl's unbilled revenues as of december 31, 2014 sold to a third party related to its sales of accounts receivable program.
pensions and other postretirement benefits - alliant energy, ipl and wpl sponsor various defined benefit pension and opeb plans that provide benefits to a significant portion of their employees. assumptions and judgments are made periodically to estimate the obligations and costs related to their retirement plans. there are many judgments and assumptions involved in determining an entity's pension and other postretirement liabilities and costs each period including employee demographics (including age, life expectancies and compensation levels), discount rates, assumed rates of return and funding. changes made to plan provisions may also impact current and future benefits costs. judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed at least annually. the following table shows the impacts of changing certain key actuarial assumptions discussed above (in millions):

income taxes - alliant energy, ipl and wpl are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. assumptions and judgments are made each reporting period to estimate income tax assets, liabilities, benefits and expenses. judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections. significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations. alliant energy's and ipl's critical assumptions and judgments for 2014 include estimates of qualifying deductions for repairs expenditures and allocation of mixed service costs due to the impact of iowa rate-making principles on such property-related differences. critical assumptions and judgments also include projections of future taxable income used to determine the ability to utilize net operating losses and credit carryforwards prior to their expiration and the states in which such future taxable income will be apportioned.
79
effect of rate-making on property-related differences - alliant energy's and ipl's effective income tax rates are normally impacted by certain property-related differences at ipl for which deferred tax is not recorded in the income statement pursuant to iowa rate-making principles. changes in methods or assumptions regarding the amount of ipl's qualifying repairs expenditures, allocation of mixed service costs, and costs related to retirement or removal of depreciable property could result in a material impact on alliant energy's and ipl's financial condition and results of operations. refer to note 1(c) for further discussion of regulatory accounting for taxes. refer to note 11 for details of how the effect of rate-making on property-related differences impacted alliant energy's and ipl's effective income tax rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012.
carryforward utilization - significant federal tax credit carryforwards and federal and state net operating loss carryforwards have been generated. based on projections of current and future taxable income, alliant energy, ipl and wpl plan to utilize substantially all of these carryforwards prior to their expiration. changes in tax regulations or assumptions regarding current and future taxable income could require valuation allowances in the future resulting in a material impact on financial condition and results of operations. refer to note 11 for further discussion of federal tax credit carryforwards, and federal and state net operating loss carryforwards.
other future considerations - in addition to items discussed earlier in mda, the notes in item 8 and "risk factors" in item 1a, the following items could impact future financial condition or results of operations:
electric transmission service expense - ipl and wpl currently receive substantially all their transmission services from itc and atc, respectively. due to the formula rates used by itc and atc to charge their customers and possible future changes to these rates as discussed below, there is uncertainty regarding the long-term trends of ipl's and wpl's future electric transmission service expense. alliant energy, ipl and wpl currently anticipate changes to their electric transmission service expense in 2015 as follows:
attachment "o" rates - the annual transmission service rates that itc or atc charge their customers are calculated each calendar year using a ferc-approved cost of service formula rate referred to as attachment "o." because attachment "o" is a ferc-approved formula rate, itc and atc can implement new rates each calendar year without filing a request with ferc. however, new rates are subject to challenge by either ferc or customers. if the rates proposed by itc or atc are determined by ferc to be unjust or unreasonable or another mechanism is determined by ferc to be just and reasonable, itc's or atc's rates would change accordingly. in march 2014, ferc issued an order accepting revised protocols to miso's attachment "o" protocols, which included changes to formalize the process for relevant parties to request information from transmission owners and file disputes related to formula rates, as well as establish timelines for such processes.
2015 rates charged by itc to ipl - in september 2014, itc filed with miso the attachment "o" rate it proposes to charge its customers in 2015 for electric transmission services. the proposed rate was based on itc's estimated net revenue requirement for 2015 as well as a true-up adjustment credit related to amounts that itc over-recovered from its customers in 2013. the 2015 attachment "o" rate filed with miso is approximately 5% higher than the rate itc charged its customers in 2014.
2015 rates charged by atc to wpl - in september 2014, atc shared with its customers the attachment "o" rate it proposes to charge them in 2015 for electric transmission services. the proposed rate was based on atc's estimated net revenue requirement for 2015 as well as a true-up adjustment credit related to amounts that atc over-recovered from its customers in 2013 and amounts that atc estimated to be over-recovered in 2014. the 2015 attachment "o" rate is approximately 3% higher than the rate atc charged its customers in 2014.
escrow accounting at wpl - electric revenues established in wpl's retail electric rate case (2015/2016 test period) included recovery of expected increases in electric transmission service expense largely due to ssr costs expected to be incurred. due to a recent revision in miso's method to allocate ssr costs, wpl no longer expects to incur such ssr costs. the difference between actual electric transmission service expense incurred and amounts collected from customers as electric revenues in 2015 and 2016 will be recorded as electric transmission service expense with an offsetting amount recorded to regulatory liabilities due to the escrow treatment wpl received as part of its approved retail electric rate case. alliant and wpl currently expect an increase in electric transmission service expense in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of wpl's escrow treatment of electric transmission service expense.
2015 electric transmission service expense - alliant energy, ipl and wpl currently estimate their total electric transmission service expense in 2015 will be higher than the comparable expense in 2014 by approximately $45 million, $15 million and $30 million, respectively, as a result of the items discussed above.
80
miso transmission owner return on equity complaint - in 2013, a group of miso industrial customer organizations filed a complaint with ferc requesting to reduce the base return on equity used by miso transmission owners, including itc and atc, to 9.15%, and institute a regulatory capital structure not to exceed 50% of common equity, among other items. itc's and atc's current authorized return on equity is 12.38% and 12.2%, respectively. itc's and atc's current authorized regulatory capital structure for common equity is 60% and 50%, respectively.
in october 2014, ferc issued an order on the complaint against the miso transmission owners, established hearing and settlement procedures on the return on equity component of the complaint, and established a refund period back to november 12, 2013. ferc also denied the request to limit the regulatory capital structure to 50% of common equity, among other items. settlement discussions between the parties were held and no agreement was reached. the complaint is now subject to hearing procedures and an initial decision from ferc on the complaint is currently expected in late 2015. alliant energy, ipl and wpl are currently unable to determine what, if any, impact the october 2014 ferc order, subsequent hearing procedures and a new methodology ferc established for determining the return on equity may have on the returns authorized by ferc for miso transmission owners, including itc and atc.
any change to itc's and atc's return on equity would impact the calculation of their respective attachment "o" rates, resulting in changes to electric transmission service costs billed by itc and atc to their customers. any changes in ipl's electric transmission service costs billed by itc to ipl are expected to be passed on to ipl's iowa retail electric customers through the transmission cost recovery rider. any changes in wpl's electric transmission service costs will be incorporated into wpl's retail electric rates in a future retail electric base rate proceeding with the pscw. pursuant to the july 2014 pscw order related to wpl's wisconsin retail electric and gas rate case (2015/2016 test period), wpl received escrow treatment for the difference between actual electric transmission service costs and those costs used to determine rates during 2015 and 2016. based on these transmission cost recovery mechanisms, ipl and wpl currently do not expect that any changes to electric transmission service costs billed by itc and atc due to this complaint will have a material impact on their financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, any change to atc's return on equity could result in alliant energy and wpl realizing lower equity income and dividends from atc in the future. alliant energy and wpl currently estimate each 25 basis point reduction in atc's authorized return on equity would reduce their annual pre-tax equity income from atc by approximately $1 million. alliant energy, ipl and wpl are currently unable to determine the timing and nature of any subsequent ferc action related to these matters and resulting changes to their financial condition and results of operations.
miso transmission owners' request for equity adder - in january 2015, ferc issued an order accepting a request from a group of miso transmission owners, including itc and atc, to implement a 50 basis point incentive adder to their return on equity based on participation in miso. the implementation of the adder is effective january 2015, subject to certain conditions. alliant energy, ipl and wpl are currently unable to determine any resulting changes to future electric transmission service charges pending a decision by ferc regarding the miso transmission owner return on equity complaint discussed above.
itc request for equity adder - in january 2015, itc requested approval from ferc to implement a 100 basis point incentive adder to their return on equity for being an independent transmission company. the implementation of the adder was requested to be effective april 1, 2015, subject to certain conditions. alliant energy and ipl are currently unable to determine the exact timing and nature of any subsequent ferc action related to this matter or any resulting changes to future electric transmission service charges.
itc's attachment "ff" tariff - in 2012, ipl filed a complaint with ferc regarding itc's attachment "ff" tariff. itc's attachment "ff" tariff determines how much of the transmission network upgrade costs incurred to interconnect an egu to itc's transmission system will be incurred by the owner of such egu. in the complaint, ipl alleged that its customers have made material incremental payments under itc's attachment "ff" tariff without obtaining equal benefits, as compared to costs that would have been charged under miso's attachment "ff" tariff applicable in the majority of the miso pricing zones. in july 2013, ferc issued an order requiring miso, on behalf of itc, to revise itc's attachment "ff" tariff to conform to the miso attachment "ff" tariff. in august 2013, miso submitted a filing with these tariff revisions, which became effective as of the date of the july 2013 order. also in august 2013, itc filed a request for rehearing and/or clarification, and ipl filed a request for clarification. in february 2014, ferc issued an order that denied itc's request for rehearing, responded to the requests for clarification, accepted miso's tariff revisions and substantially affirmed its july 2013 order. in march 2014, another utility filed a request for rehearing with ferc on the february 2014 order. it is uncertain how or when future ferc action, if any, could change the results of the february 2014 order or the future amount
81
of electric transmission service charges billed by itc to ipl and wpl. the revised attachment "ff" tariff is expected to reduce the amount of transmission network upgrade costs billed by itc to ipl compared to what would have been billed under itc's prior attachment "ff" tariff. alliant energy and ipl currently expect to pass on the iowa retail portion of any changes in electric transmission service costs billed by itc to ipl from the revision in itc's attachment "ff" tariff to ipl's retail electric customers in iowa through the transmission cost recovery rider.
sales trends -
jo-carroll - in march 2014, jo-carroll provided notice of termination of its wholesale power supply agreement with ipl effective april 1, 2018. sales to jo-carroll represented 3% of ipl's total electric sales in 2014.
wppi energy - in november 2014, wppi energy provided notice of termination of its wholesale power supply agreement with wpl effective may 31, 2017. sales to wppi energy represented 8% of wpl's total electric sales in 2014.
great lakes utilities - in october 2014, great lakes utilities provided notice of termination of its wholesale power supply agreement with wpl effective december 31, 2017. sales to great lakes utilities represented approximately 2% of wpl's total electric sales in 2014.
retirement plan costs - alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's net periodic benefit costs related to their defined benefit pension and opeb plans are currently expected to be higher in 2015 compared to 2014 by approximately $21 million, $11 million and $10 million, respectively. the increase in net periodic benefit costs is primarily due to the use of lower discount rates and a change in life expectancy assumptions as of december 31, 2014. approximately 30% to 40% of net periodic benefit costs are allocated to capital projects each year. as a result, the increase in net periodic benefit costs is not expected to result in a comparable increase in other operation and maintenance expenses. refer to note 12(a) for additional details of defined benefit pension and opeb plans.
performance-based compensation plans - alliant energy's total compensation package includes a performance-based compensation program, which provides substantially all of its non-bargaining employees an opportunity to receive annual cash payments based on the achievement of specific short-term annual operational and financial performance measures. in addition, the total compensation program for certain key employees includes long-term awards issued under equity-based compensation plans. in 2014, alliant energy, ipl and wpl incurred $42 million, $24 million and $17 million, respectively, of performance-based compensation expense. refer to note 12(b) for details of the equity-based compensation plans. alliant energy, ipl and wpl are currently unable to determine what impacts these performance-based compensation plans will have on their future financial condition or results of operations.

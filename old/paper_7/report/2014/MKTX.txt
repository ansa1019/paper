item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with "selected financial data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. in addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements relating to future events and the future performance of marketaxess that are based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about us and our industry. these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results and timing of various events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, as more fully described in this section, in "item 1a. - risk factors" and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.
executive overview marketaxess operates a leading electronic trading platform that enables fixed-income market participants to efficiently trade corporate bonds and other types of fixed-income instruments using our patented trading technology. our over 1,000 active participant firms include broker-dealer clients, investment advisers, mutual funds, insurance companies, public and private pension funds, bank portfolios and hedge funds. our approximately 90 broker-dealer market-maker clients provide liquidity on the platform and include most of the leading broker-dealers in global fixed-income trading. we also execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal (often called "riskless principal") basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which then settle through a third-party clearing broker. we provide fixed-income market data, analytics and compliance tools that help our clients make trading decisions. we also provide trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services to the securities markets. in addition, we provide technology solutions and professional consulting services to fixed-income industry participants.
our multi-dealer trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing, executable bids or offers from our broker-dealer clients and execute trades with the broker-dealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond. we offer our broker-dealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds. our trading platform provides access to global liquidity in u.s. high-grade corporate bonds, emerging markets and high-yield bonds, european bonds, u.s. agency bonds, credit derivatives and other fixed-income securities.
through our open tradingtm initiative, we have designed a series of protocols to allow our broker-dealers and institutional investor clients to interact in an all-to-all trading environment.  these innovative technology solutions are designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our electronic trading platform and create a menu of solutions to address different trade sizes and bond liquidity characteristics.
the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform and distribution fees that are billed to our broker-dealer clients on a monthly basis. we also derive revenues from information and post-trade services, technology products and services, investment income and other income. our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, technology and communication expenses, professional and consulting fees, occupancy, marketing and advertising and other general and administrative expenses.
our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, connecting broker-dealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently, while offering a broad array of information, trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle. the key elements of our strategy are:
·   to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings to the marketaxess platform that we believe will help to increase our market share with existing clients, as well as to expand our client base;

·   to leverage our existing client network and technology to increase the number of potential counterparties and improve liquidity by developing and deploying a wide range of electronic trading protocols to complement our traditional request-for-quote model and allowing broker-dealers and institutional investors to interact in an all-to-all trading environment;

·   to leverage our existing technology and client relationships to deploy our electronic trading platform into additional product segments within the fixed-income securities markets and deliver fixed-income securities-related technical services and products;

·   to continue building our existing service offerings so that our electronic trading platform is more fully integrated into the workflow of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients and to continue to add functionality to allow our clients to achieve a fully automated end-to-end straight-through processing solution (automation from trade initiation to settlement);

·   to add new content and analytical capabilities to corporate bondtickertm and expand the data service offering provided by xtrakter limited ("xtrakter") to improve the value of the information we provide to our clients; and

·   to continue to increase and supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances, or acquiring businesses or technologies that will enable us to enter new markets, provide new products or services, or otherwise enhance the value of our platform to our clients. for example, the acquisition of xtrakter in february 2013 provided us with an expanded set of technology solutions ahead of incoming pre- and post-trade transparency mandates from the markets in financial

43
instruments directive ii ("mifid ii") in europe. in april 2013, we entered into a strategic alliance with blackrock, inc. ("blackrock") to create a unified, open trading solution designed to help reduce liquidity fragmentation and improve pricing across u.s. cash credit markets. in january 2015, we expanded this alliance with blackrock to include european cash credit markets.

critical factors affecting our industry and our company economic, political and market factors the global fixed-income securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic, political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. these factors include, among others, credit market conditions, the current interest rate environment, including the volatility of interest rates and investors' forecasts of future interest rates, economic and political conditions in the united states, europe and elsewhere, and the consolidation or contraction of our broker-dealer clients.
competitive landscape the global fixed-income securities industry generally, and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular, are highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. sources of competition for us will continue to include, among others, bond trading conducted directly between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multi-dealer trading companies. competitors, including companies in which some of our broker-dealer clients have invested, have developed or acquired electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms that may compete with us.
in general, we compete on the basis of a number of key factors, including, among others, the liquidity provided on our platform, the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform and the quality and speed of execution. we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors.
our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems. we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform, working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs.
regulatory environment our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, which could require us to incur significant costs.
following the global financial crisis and other recent events in the financial industry, governments and regulators in both the united states and europe have called for increased regulation and transparency in the over-the-counter markets. as a result, the dodd-frank act was signed into law in july 2010. among the most significant aspects of the derivatives section of the dodd-frank act are mandatory clearing of many credit derivative instruments through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those instruments through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities ("sefs"), in each case, subject to certain key exceptions. in september 2013, the u.s. commodity futures trading commission ("cftc") granted temporary registration to marketaxess sef corporation, our wholly-owned u.s. subsidiary, to operate a sef for the trading of swaps subject to the cftc's jurisdiction. the cftc's rules relating to the trading of swaps on sefs were implemented in october 2013 and, in february 2014, certain credit derivatives became subject to the cftc's 'made available for trade' determination and were thereafter required to be executed on a sef or designated contract market. the securities and exchange commission ("sec") has not yet finalized its rules for security-based sefs, nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and implementation of such rules. no assurance can be given regarding when, whether or in what form the remaining rules regarding the new regulatory regime for the swaps marketplace will be finalized or implemented.
various rules promulgated since the financial crisis could adversely affect our bank-affiliated broker-dealer clients' ability to make markets in a variety of fixed-income securities, thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform. for example, the volcker rule promulgated under the dodd-frank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates. in addition, enhanced leverage ratios applicable to large banking organizations in the u.s. and europe require such organizations to strengthen their balance sheets and may limit their ability or willingness to make markets on our trading platform. we cannot predict the extent to which these rules or any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations.
similar to the u.s., regulatory bodies in europe are developing new rules for the fixed-income markets. in june 2014, the final texts of mifid ii and markets in financial instruments regulation ("mifir") were published in the official journal of the european
44
union.  a large amount of implementation work is left to be completed and the rules of mifid ii and mifir will not take effect for 30 months after publication, or until january 2017. mifid ii introduces changes in market structure designed: (i) to enhance pre- and post-trade transparency for fixed income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity, (ii) increase and enhance post-trade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit post-trade data to approved reporting mechanisms, (iii) ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and (iv) establish a consolidated tape for trade data. we cannot predict the extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes will impact our european business and operations.
rapid technological changes we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform. the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models. our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services, develop and/or license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective broker-dealer and institutional investor clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. we have been issued 13 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology.
trends in our business the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platform between our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients and monthly distribution fees. we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platform and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us:
·   the number of participants on our platform and their willingness to originate transactions through the platform;

·   the number of broker-dealer clients on the platform and the frequency and competitiveness of the price responses they provide on our platform;

·   the number of markets for which we make trading available to our clients;

·   the overall level of activity in these markets; and

·   the level of commissions that we collect for trades executed through the platform.

we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates, the direction of interest rate movements, the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus u.s. treasury securities. because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform, it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes, regardless of the cause of such decline, would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability.
commission revenue commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type, size, yield and maturity of the bond traded. under our transaction fee plans, bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions, while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions.
u.s. high-grade corporate bond commissions. our u.s. high-grade corporate bond fee plans generally incorporate variable transaction fees and distribution fees billed to our broker-dealer clients on a monthly basis. certain dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments. under the fee plans, we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the broker-dealer client. the u.s. high-grade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and, as a result, is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded. the average u.s. high-grade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield, years-to-maturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform.
other credit commissions. other credit includes emerging markets bonds, high-yield bonds, eurobonds and structured products bonds. commissions for other credit products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules. similar to the u.s. high-grade plans, our european fee plans generally incorporate monthly distribution fees, as well as variable transaction fees.
liquid products commissions. liquid products includes u.s. agency, european government bonds and credit derivatives. commissions for liquid products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules.
45
for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller, we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two trades.
we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future. consequently, past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions.
other revenue in addition to the commissions discussed above, we earn revenue from information and post-trade services, technology products and services, income on investments and other income.
information and post-trade services. we generate revenue from information services provided to our broker-dealer clients, institutional investor clients and data-only subscribers. information services are invoiced monthly, quarterly or annually. when billed in advance, revenues are deferred and recognized monthly on a straight-line basis. we also generate revenue from trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services. revenue is recognized in the period the services are provided.
technology products and services. we generate revenue from professional consulting services, technology software licenses and maintenance and support services.
investment income. investment income consists of income earned on our investments.
other. other revenues include fees from telecommunications line charges to broker-dealer clients, initial set-up fees and other miscellaneous revenues.
expenses in the normal course of business, we incur the following expenses:
employee compensation and benefits. employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries, stock-based compensation costs, other incentive compensation, employee benefits and payroll taxes.
depreciation and amortization. we depreciate our computer hardware and related software, office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straight-line basis over three to seven years. we amortize leasehold improvements on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease. intangible assets with definite lives, including purchased technologies, customer relationships and other intangible assets, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from three to 15 years. intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment.
technology and communications. technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to maintenance on software and hardware, our internal network connections, data center hosting costs and data feeds provided by outside vendors or service providers. the majority of our broker-dealer clients have dedicated high-speed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer. we charge our broker-dealer clients a monthly fee for these connections, which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur.
professional and consulting fees. professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees, legal fees and fees paid to information technology and non-information technology consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platform and information and post-trade services products.
occupancy. occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent, utilities and commercial rent tax.
marketing and advertising. marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of print and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services. this expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industry-sponsored seminars, conferences and conventions, and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platform and information services.
general and administrative. general and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment, clearing costs from matched principal trades, board of directors' expenses, charitable contributions, provision for doubtful accounts, and various state franchise and u.k. value-added taxes.
46
expenses may grow in the future, notably in employee compensation and benefits and depreciation and amortization, primarily due to investment in new products and geographic expansion. however, we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure.
critical accounting policies and estimates this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, also referred to as u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
use of estimates on an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical. that is, these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
software development costs we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal use software, including among other items, employee compensation and related benefits and third party consulting costs at the point at which the conceptual formulation, design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed. once the product is ready for its intended use, such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over three years. we review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.
revenue recognition the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform and distribution fees that are billed to our broker-dealer clients on a monthly basis. we also derive revenues from information and post-trade services, technology products and services, investment income and other income.
commission revenue. commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type and maturity of the bond traded. under our transaction fee plans, bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions, while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions. for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller, we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two matched principal trades. fee programs for certain products include distribution fees which are recognized monthly.
information and post-trade services. we generate revenue from information services provided to our broker-dealer clients, institutional investor clients and data-only subscribers. information services are invoiced monthly, quarterly or annually. when billed in advance, revenues are deferred and recognized monthly on a straight-line basis. we also generate revenue from trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting. revenue is recognized in the period the services are provided.
technology products and services. we generate revenues from professional consulting services, technology software licenses and maintenance and support services (referred to as post-contract technical support or "pcs"). revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable.
we enter into time and materials professional consulting contracts unrelated to any software product. revenue for time and materials contracts is recognized as services are performed. we generally sell software license subscriptions on a stand-alone basis or software licenses and pcs together as part of multiple-element arrangements. revenue for software license subscriptions is recognized ratably over the contract period. for arrangements that include multiple elements, generally software licenses and pcs, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence ("vsoe") of the fair value of the
47
undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as license revenue. when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. for pcs, the term is typically one year and revenue is recognized over the duration of the arrangement on a straight-line basis.
initial set-up fees. we enter into agreements with our broker-dealer clients pursuant to which we provide access to our platform through a non-exclusive and non-transferable license. broker-dealer clients may pay an initial set-up fee, which is typically due and payable upon execution of the broker-dealer agreement. the initial set-up fee, if any, varies by agreement. revenue is recognized over the initial term of the agreement, which is generally two years. initial set-up fees are reported in other income in our consolidated statements of operations.
stock-based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards based on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date. these costs are recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period, with an offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital.
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years. we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.
business combinations, goodwill and intangibles assets business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates, growth rates and asset lives.
we operate as a single reporting unit. subsequent to an acquisition, goodwill no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition, but instead becomes identifiable with the entire reporting unit. as a result, all of our fair value is available to support the value of goodwill. an impairment review of goodwill is performed on an annual basis, at year-end, or more frequently if circumstances change. intangible assets with definite lives, including purchased technologies, customer relationships and other intangible assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from three to 15 years. intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements.
48
segment results we operate an electronic multi-party platform for the trading of fixed-income securities and provide related data, analytics, compliance tools and post-trade services. our operations constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of these product and services, of the financial markets in which we compete and of our worldwide business activities. we believe that results by geographic region or client sector are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business. see note 16 to the consolidate financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for certain geographic information about the company's business required by u.s. gaap.
results of operations year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013
overview total revenues increased by $24.0 million or 10.1% to $262.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $238.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase in total revenues was primarily due to an increase in commissions of $17.5 million and an increase in revenue from information and post-trade services of $6.1 million. the increase in revenue from information and post-trade services was primarily due to the inclusion in 2014 of two additional months of revenues from xtrakter, which was acquired in february 2013. a 5.4% change in the foreign currency exchange rates of the pound sterling compared to the u.s. dollar from the year ended december 31, 2013 to the year ended december 31, 2014 had the effect of increasing revenues by $1.9 million.
total expenses increased by $12.8 million or 9.7% to $144.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $131.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits of $10.6 million, depreciation and amortization of $3.3 million, technology and communication costs of $1.6 million and marketing and advertising costs of $1.1 million, which were partially offset by a decrease in professional and consulting fees of $3.8 million.  the increase in expenses reflects the inclusion in 2014 of two additional months of expenses from xtrakter.  during the second quarter of 2013, we determined that we had incorrectly excluded incentive compensation as a component of employee compensation eligible for capitalization under our software development costs capitalization policy.  we recorded this item as an out-of-period adjustment in the three months ended june 30, 2013 by reducing employee compensation and benefits expense by $2.9 million and increasing depreciation and amortization expense by $1.3 million. the change in foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing expenses by $1.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
income before taxes from continuing operations increased by $11.3 million or 10.5% to $118.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $107.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. net income from continuing operations increased by $6.2 million or 9.1% to $74.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $68.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.
in october 2013, we sold greenline financial technologies, inc. ("greenline") for $11.0 million and recognized a gain on the sale, net of a tax benefit, of $7.6 million. greenline's operating results have been classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations. the net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $0.2 million.

for volume reporting purposes, transactions in foreign currencies are converted to u.s. dollars at average monthly rates. the 8.0% increase in u.s. high-grade volume was principally due to an increase in our estimated market share of total u.s. high-grade corporate bond volume as reported by financial industry regulatory authority ("finra") trade reporting and compliance engine ("trace") from 13.8% for the year ended december 31, 2013 to 14.5% (adjusted by us to eliminate the increased reporting of affiliate back-to-back trades to finra beginning in april 2014 and the inclusion of 144a securities in reported trace volumes beginning on july 1, 2014) for the year ended december 31, 2014, coupled with an increase in estimated u.s. high-grade trace volume.  estimated u.s. high-grade trace volume for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $3.4 trillion, an increase of approximately 5% from the year ended december 31, 2013.  based on information provided by finra, we believe that the trace volumes, as adjusted by us, provide a more accurate comparison to prior period reporting.  we have provided a reconciliation of the
50
reported u.s. high-grade trace volumes to the adjusted u.s. high-grade trace volumes in the "investor relations" section of our website.
other credit volumes increased by 27.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to increase in estimated market share in emerging markets bonds, eurobonds and high-yield bonds. liquid products volume decreased by 14.1% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, due mainly to lower trading volumes in u.s. agency bonds. estimated u.s. agency trace volumes declined by 17.6% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013.
our average variable transaction fee per million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 was as follows:

the u.s. high-grade average variable transaction fee per million decreased to $175 per million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $190 per million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the change was primarily due to a decrease in the duration, and an increase in the nominal size, of bonds traded. u.s. high-grade floating rate average variable transaction fee per million increased from $25 for the year ended december 31, 2013 to $51 for the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily due to a change in our pricing calculation to conform to the market convention for such instruments.
distribution fees distribution fees increased by $3.5 million or 5.8% to $64.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $61.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. u.s. high-grade distribution fees increased $4.5 million principally due to the migration over the past year of certain of our broker-dealer clients from an all-variable fee plan to a plan that incorporates a monthly distribution fee. the $1.4 million decrease in other credit distribution fees principally relates to the migration of certain eurobond dealers to plans that incorporate a higher level of variable fees and lower level of monthly distribution fees. the $0.5 million increase in liquid products distribution fees was due to the commencement of sef-related revenues during 2014.
information and post-trade services. information and post-trade services revenues increased by $6.1 million or 24.2% to $31.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $25.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, principally due to the inclusion of two additional months of revenues from xtrakter in 2014 and the favorable impact of a change in foreign currency exchange rates of $1.3 million.  xtrakter's transaction reporting business processed approximately 1,100 million and 943 million transactions for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
technology products and services. technology products and services revenues increased by $0.5 million or 8.6% to $6.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $6.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.  the increase was primarily a result of higher professional consulting services revenues.
investment income. investment income increased by $0.1 million or 29.3% to $0.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $0.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to a higher average investment balance in 2014.
other. other revenues decreased by $0.2 million or 8.3% to $2.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $3.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. in the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized income of $0.9 million on the sale of certain mf global bankruptcy claims. in the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded a gain of $0.8 million on the sale of u.s. treasuries.  we used the proceeds from the sale of u.s. treasuries to fund the acquisition of xtrakter.

employee compensation and benefits. employee compensation and benefits increased by $10.6 million or 16.4% to $75.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $64.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily due to higher wages and benefits of $6.0 million, employee incentive compensation of $1.0 million and the out-of period adjustment for software development costs of $2.9 million in the year ended december 31, 2013.  the total number of employees increased to 303 as of december 31, 2014 from 293 as of december 31, 2013.  employee compensation and benefits for the year ended december 31, 2014 include two additional months of compensation and benefit expenses from xtrakter.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization increased by $3.3 million or 23.1% to $17.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $14.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was due to higher depreciation of production hardware of $2.0 million and amortization of software development costs of $2.2 million, partially offset by the out-of-period adjustment for software development costs of $1.3 million in the year ended december 31, 2013. for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, $4.6 million and $15.3 million, respectively, of equipment purchases and leasehold improvements and $10.2 million and $7.9 million, respectively, of software development costs were capitalized. the lower equipment purchases and leasehold improvements in 2014 were primarily due to the build-out of a replacement primary production data center in 2013 and the build-out costs for new office space in london in 2013. the higher software development costs were primarily due to continued investment in new product initiatives and xtrakter technology architecture changes.
technology and communications. technology and communications expenses increased by $1.6 million or 10.3% to $17.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $16.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was due to higher office telecommunication costs of $1.0 million and software maintenance and support of $0.7 million.
professional and consulting fees. professional and consulting fees decreased by $3.8 million or 21.1% to $14.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $18.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease was due to lower technology consulting costs of $1.7 million, legal fees of $1.3 million and recruiting fees of $0.4 million.  in 2013, we incurred approximately $1.2 million in investment banking, legal and other professional fees related to the xtrakter acquisition.
occupancy. occupancy costs decreased by $0.8 million or 15.3% to $4.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $5.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the decreased occupancy costs principally related to a loss on a sub-lease and duplicate rent aggregating $0.6 million related to our move to a new u.k. office in 2013.marketing and advertising. marketing and advertising expenses increased by $1.1 million or 24.5% to $5.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $4.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was due to higher sales related travel and entertainment costs of $0.6 million and promotion and trade show costs of $0.4 million.
general and administrative. general and administrative expenses increased by $0.8 million or 8.9% to $9.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $8.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.  the increase was primarily due to higher clearing costs from matched principal trading, vat expense and board of director fees.
52
provision for income tax we recorded an income tax provision from continuing operations of $43.7 million and $38.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in the 2014 tax provision was primarily attributable to an increase in pre-tax income and a higher effective tax rate. our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 was 36.9%, compared to 36.1% for the year ended december 31, 2013. the 2013 income tax provision included benefits for certain 2012 tax credits enacted into law in 2013 and a catch-up tax benefit associated with the domestic production activities deduction.  our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings and changes in tax legislation and tax rates.
as of december 31, 2014, we had restricted u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $8.0 million. the utilization of our restricted u.s. net operating loss carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation as determined by section 382 of the internal revenue code.
year ended december 31, 2013 compared to year ended december 31, 2012
overview total revenues increased by $47.9 million or 25.1% to $238.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $190.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. this increase in total revenues was primarily due to an increase in commissions of $29.5 million and revenue from information and post-trade services of 17.9 million. information and post-trade services revenue generated by xtrakter totaled $18.4 million from the february 28, 2013 acquisition date until december 31, 2013.
total expenses increased by $30.0 million or 29.5% to $131.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $101.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  this increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits of $9.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $7.4 million, professional and consulting expenses of $6.1 million and technology and communications costs of $3.5 million.  total expenses for 2013 included approximately $19.7 million of xtrakter operating expenses and an additional $1.6 million of acquisition-related costs.  during the second quarter of 2013, we determined that we had incorrectly excluded incentive compensation as a component of employee compensation eligible for capitalization under our software development costs capitalization policy.  we assessed this error and determined that it was not material to previous reporting periods and is not material to the current year.  therefore, we recorded this item as an out-of-period adjustment in the three months ended june 30, 2013 by reducing employee compensation and benefits expense by $2.9 million and increasing depreciation and amortization expense by $1.3 million.
income before taxes from continuing operations increased by $17.9 million or 20% to $107.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $89.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  net income from continuing operations increased by $6.8 million or 11.0% to $68.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $61.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.
in october 2013, we sold greenline for $11.0 million and recognized a gain on the sale, net of a tax benefit, of $7.6 million.  greenline's operating results have been classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations.  the net loss from discontinued operations for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 was $0.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively.

for volume reporting purposes, transactions in foreign currencies are converted to u.s. dollars at average monthly rates. the 19.7% increase in u.s. high-grade volume was principally due to an increase in our estimated market share of total u.s. high-grade corporate bond volume as reported by finra trace from 12.4% for the year ended december 31, 2012 to 13.8% for the year ended december 31, 2013, coupled with an increase in estimated u.s. high-grade trace volume. estimated u.s. high-grade trace volume for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $3.2 trillion, an increase of approximately 8.0% from the year ended december 31, 2012. our other credit volumes increased by 27.1% for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily due to estimated market share gains in emerging market and high-yield bond volumes. liquid products volume
54
decreased by 7.4% for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the year ended december 31, 2012, due mainly to lower trading volumes in u.s. agency bonds. estimated u.s. agency trace volumes declined by 33.6% in 2013.
our average variable transaction fee per million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 was as follows:

the u.s. high-grade average variable transaction fee per million decreased to $190 per million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $197 per million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the change was primarily due to a decrease in the duration of bonds traded and the effect of two broker-dealer market makers moving from an all-variable plan to a plan that incorporates a monthly distribution fee. other credit average variable transaction fee per million increased to $311 per million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $281 per million for the year ended december 31, 2012 primarily due to a larger percentage of volume in products that carry higher fees per million, principally emerging markets and high-yield bonds. liquid products average variable transaction fee per million increased to $45 per million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $41 per million for the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily due to a change in the mix of products traded.
distribution fees distribution fees increased by $2.0 million or 3.4% to $61.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $59.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. u.s. high-grade distribution fees increased $2.5 million principally due to the migration of two broker-dealer market makers that moved from an all-variable fee plan to a plan that incorporates a monthly distribution fee, partially offset by a decrease in other credit distribution fees of $0.7 million.
information and post-trade services. information and post-trade services increased by $17.9 million or 241.3% to $25.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $7.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  information and post-trade services revenue generated by xtrakter for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $18.4 million. xtrakter's transaction reporting business processed approximately 943 million transactions for the year ended december 31, 2013.
technology products and services. technology products and services revenues increased by $1.3 million or 26.9% to $6.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $5.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  the increase was primarily a result of higher professional consulting services revenues.
investment income. investment income decreased by $0.6 million or 60.3% to $0.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $1.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  the decrease was due to a reduction in average cash and securities available-for-sale balances and lower average yields.
other.  other revenues decreased by $0.2 million or 6.6% to $3.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $3.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  the decrease was mainly due to lower initial setup fees from broker-dealer clients.

employee compensation and benefits.  employee compensation and benefits increased by $9.7 million or 17.8% to $64.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $54.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  the increase was primarily due to higher wages and benefits of $10.2 million and an increase in employee incentive compensation costs of $2.0 million, offset by the favorable out-of-period adjustment of $2.9 million.  xtrakter employee compensation and benefits was $8.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.  the total number of employees increased to 293 as of december 31, 2013 from 206 as of december 31, 2012, mainly due to personnel increases associated with the xtrakter acquisition.
depreciation and amortization.  depreciation and amortization expense increased by $7.4 million or 109.0% to $14.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $6.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  the increase was principally due to higher amortization of software development costs of $3.2 million resulting from increased product development, amortization of the xtrakter intangible assets of $1.9 million, the out-of-period adjustment of $1.3 million and higher production equipment depreciation of $1.0 million.  for the year ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, $15.3 million and $5.2 million, respectively, of equipment purchases and leasehold improvements and $7.9 million and $5.2 million, respectively, of software development costs were capitalized.  the higher equipment purchases and leasehold improvements were primarily due to the build-out of a replacement primary production data center in 2013 and the build-out costs for new office space in london in 2013.
technology and communications.  technology and communications expense increased by $3.5 million or 28.1% to $16.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $12.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  the increase was mainly due to technology and communications costs from xtrakter of $2.5 million and an increase in it licenses and maintenance of $0.6 million.
professional and consulting fees. professional and consulting fees increased by $6.1 million or 50.0% to $18.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $12.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  the increase was primarily due to xtrakter professional and consulting fees of $2.5 million relating primarily to consulting costs and recruiting fees, higher it consulting expenses of $1.3 million, approximately $1.2 million in investment banking, legal and other professional fees related to the xtrakter acquisition and higher recruiting costs of $0.6 million.
occupancy. occupancy costs increased by $2.7 million or 111.5% to $5.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $2.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, principally related to xtrakter occupancy costs of $1.6 million and a loss on a sub-lease and duplicate rent in the u.k of $0.6 million.
marketing and advertising. marketing and advertising expense decreased by $0.5 million or 10.4% to $4.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $5.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  the decrease was principally due to a reduction in advertising expenses related to new product initiatives of $0.4 million.
general and administrative. general and administrative expense increased by $1.1 million or 14.4% to $8.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $7.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to higher registration and trade clearing fees of $0.5 million and approximately $0.4 million of transaction costs related to the xtrakter acquisition.
56
provision for income tax we recorded an income tax provision from continuing operations of $38.7 million and $27.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in the 2013 tax provision was attributable to an increase in pre-tax income and a non-recurring favorable income tax adjustment of $6.7 million in 2012.  our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 was 36.1%, compared to 30.9% for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 was principally due to the favorable income tax adjustment of $6.7 million in 2012 relating to certain previously unrecognized tax benefits. we updated the recognition of certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards in response to a private letter ruling received from the internal revenue service. our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings and changes in tax legislation and tax rates.
as of december 31, 2013, we had restricted u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $10.8 million. the utilization of our restricted u.s. net operating loss carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation as determined by section 382 of the internal revenue code.
quarterly results of operations our quarterly results have varied significantly as a result of:
●   changes in trading volume due to market conditions, changes in the number of trading days in certain quarters, and seasonality effects caused by slow-downs in trading activity during certain periods;

●   changes in the number of broker-dealers and institutional investors using our trading platform, as well as variation in usage by existing clients;

●   expansion of the products we offer to our clients; and

●   variance in our expenses, particularly employee compensation and benefits.

the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly income statement data for the eight quarters ended december 31, 2014. in our opinion, this unaudited information has been prepared on a basis consistent with our annual financial statements and includes all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the unaudited quarterly data. this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10-k. the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that we may achieve for any subsequent periods.

liquidity and capital resources during the past three years, we have met our funding requirements through cash on hand and internally generated funds. cash and cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale totaled $233.8 million at december 31, 2014.
in january 2013, we entered into a three-year credit agreement that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of $50.0 million. as of december 31, 2014, there was $49.9 million available to borrow under the credit facility. subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions, we are permitted to upsize the credit facility by an additional $50.0 million.
our cash flows were as follows:

cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013
net cash provided by operating activities was $110.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $90.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the $19.1 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the increase in net income from continuing operations of $6.2 million, an increase in depreciation and amortization of $4.3 million, a decrease in working capital of $4.4 million and a decrease in deferred taxes of $1.0 million.

net cash used in investing activities was $13.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $69.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the $56.1 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was due to the acquisition of xtrakter in 2013 for $37.8 million, an increase in net proceeds from securities available-for-sale of $18.5 million and a decrease in capital expenditures of $8.5 million, offset by a decrease of $9.3 million in cash proceeds from the sale of greenline in 2013.
net cash used in financing activities was $60.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $17.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the $43.1 million increase in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to repurchases of our common stock of $38.0 million in 2014 and an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock of $4.1 million.
free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less expenditures for furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, free cash flow was $95.2 million, $67.6 million and $71.2 million, respectively. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure. we believe that this non-gaap financial measure, when taken into consideration with the corresponding gaap financial measures, is important in gaining an understanding of our financial strength and cash flow generation.
past trends of cash flows are not necessarily indicative of future cash flow levels. a decrease in cash flows may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business and financial condition.
cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to year ended december 31, 2012
net cash provided by operating activities was $90.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $81.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the $9.3 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net income of $15.9 million and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $4.8 million, offset by the gain on the sale of greenline of $7.6 million, an increase in working capital of $2.1 million and a decrease in deferred taxes of $0.7 million.
net cash used in investing activities was $69.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $15.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  in february 2013, we acquired xtrakter for $37.8 million in cash, net of cash acquired.  we received cash proceeds on the october 2013 sale of greenline of $9.3 million, net of cash sold and transaction expenses.  net purchases of securities available-for-sale were $17.3 million and net proceeds of securities available-for-sale were $25.4 million for year ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  capital expenditures were $23.3 million and $10.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  the higher capital expenditures during the year ended december 31, 2013 were primarily due to higher capitalized software expenditures associated with new product initiatives, the build-out of a replacement primary production data center in 2013 and the build-out costs for new office space in london in 2013.
net cash used in financing activities was $17.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $136.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.  the $119.0 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to repurchases of our common stock in 2012 of $75.1 million, lower excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $9.7 million and lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $5.5 million, offset by a decrease in cash dividends paid on common stock of $44.2 million and lower withholding tax payments on restricted stock vesting and stock option exercises of $15.0 million. we paid a special cash dividend on our common stock in december 2012 of $47.6 million.
other factors influencing liquidity and capital resources we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. however, our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream. we may also acquire or invest in technologies, business ventures or products that are complementary to our business. in the event we require any additional financing, it will take the form of equity or debt financing. any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders. any debt financings, if available at all, may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends, issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business.
certain of our u.s. subsidiaries are registered as a broker-dealer or a sef and therefore are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the sec and the cftc. these rules contain minimum net capital requirements, as defined in the applicable regulations, and also may require a significant part of the registrants' assets be kept in relatively liquid form. certain of our foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the financial conduct authority in the u.k. or ontario securities commission in canada and must maintain financial resources, as defined in the applicable regulations, in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement. as of december 31, 2014, each of our subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum requirements. as of december 31, 2014, our subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were $81.1 million in excess of the required levels of $12.4 million.

each of our u.s. and foreign regulated subsidiaries are subject to local regulations which generally prohibit repayment of borrowings from our affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity's principal regulator.
as of december 31, 2014, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries was $29.8 million. we have determined that unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the u.s.  any repatriation of such foreign earnings by way of dividend may be subject to both u.s. federal and state income taxes, reduced by applicable foreign tax credits. however, we do not have any current needs or foreseeable plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our non-u.s. subsidiaries.
we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which settle through a third-party clearing broker. settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date. cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, revenues from matched principal trading were approximately $7.4 million, $6.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively. under securities clearing agreements with a third party clearing broker, we maintain a collateral deposit with the clearing broker in the form of cash. as of december 31, 2014, the amount of the collateral deposit included in prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated statements of financial condition was $0.9 million. we are exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction. pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements between us and our clearing brokers, the clearing brokers have the right to charge us for losses resulting from a counterparty's failure to fulfill its contractual obligations. the losses are not capped at a maximum amount and apply to all trades executed through such clearing broker. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had not recorded any liabilities with regard to this right.
in the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations, warranties and general indemnifications. our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred. however, based on past experience, we expect the risk of material loss to be remote.
in january 2014, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $35.0 million of our common stock. in july 2014, our board of directors increased the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional $65.0 million of our common stock. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we repurchased 646,185 shares of our common stock at a cost of $38.0 million. as of december 31, 2014, approximately $62.0 million remains authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program. shares repurchased under the program will be held in treasury for future use. the share repurchase program will expire on december 31, 2015.
in january 2015, our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share payable on february 26, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 12, 2015. any future declaration and payment of dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors. our board of directors may take into account such matters as general business conditions, our financial results, capital requirements, contractual obligations, legal, and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to their respective parent entities, and such other factors as the board of directors may deem relevant.
effects of inflation because the majority of our assets are short-term in nature, they are not significantly affected by inflation. however, the rate of inflation may affect our expenses, such as employee compensation, office leasing costs and communications expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services. to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in certain foreign currency cash flows resulting from the net investment in our u.k. subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2014, the notional value of the foreign currency forward contract outstanding was $32.0 million and the fair value of the asset was $0.1 million.
in january 2013, we entered into a three-year credit agreement that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of $50.0 million. subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions, we are permitted to upsize the credit facility by an additional $50.0 million.
in january 2015, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend to be paid to the holders of the outstanding shares of capital stock. a cash dividend of $0.20 per share will be payable on february 26, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 12, 2015. we expect the total amount payable to be approximately $7.5 million.

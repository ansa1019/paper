item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k and with part i, item 1a, "risk factors." please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form 10-k regarding forward-looking statements.
business overview we continue to focus on executing our system design enablement, or sde, strategy to deliver the technologies necessary for integrated system and soc design with an end product in mind. our growing core eda business is at the heart of our sde strategy and is complemented by our business in ip, system interconnect and analysis, system level design and hardware-software development.
our business serves customers that are driven by end-user demand for electronics systems, ics and devices that are smaller, use less power and provide more functionality. we offer innovative solutions to help our customers meet these demands.
our future performance depends on our ability to innovate, commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products. we must keep pace with our customers' technical developments, satisfy industry standards and meet our customers' increasingly demanding performance, productivity, quality and predictability requirements. we expect to continue to invest in research and development and customer and partner relationships.
we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings "results of operations" and "liquidity and capital resources."
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. we base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. at least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary. we believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition, business combinations, intangible asset and goodwill impairments and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. for information on our significant accounting policies, see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes. there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances, changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws, and developments in current and future tax examinations.
we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. to make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. for a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits, see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

revenue recognition we begin to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met:
•   we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer;
•   delivery has occurred;
•   the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement; and
•   collectibility of the fee is probable.
significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable, and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period. for installment contracts that do not include a substantial upfront payment, we consider a fee to be fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are less than or equal to the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable. such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
we must also make judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal) constitutes a concession. we have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable, without providing concessions on payments, products or services.
generally, we are able to estimate whether collection is probable, but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination. key external and internal factors are considered in developing our creditworthiness assessment, including public information, historical and current financial statements and past collection history. if our experience were to change, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. if, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which is generally upon receipt of cash payment.
in general, revenue associated with term and subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license, commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the first software product. in general, product revenue associated with perpetual licenses where vendor specific objective evidence, or vsoe, exists for the undelivered maintenance is recognized up front, upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met, and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. a relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an upfront basis.
our hardware products generally include the hardware product and its related essential software, and maintenance for the hardware and the essential software. consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential software is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term.
revenue from customized ip services is recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method. if a service contract is considered to be part of a multiple element arrangement, or mea, that includes a software contract, revenue is generally recognized ratably over the duration of the software contract. for contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances, and specification and testing requirement changes. if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations.
if a group of contracts is so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such arrangements are deemed to be an mea. we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are, in substance, an mea. our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an mea can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts, which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved. for example, a perpetual license agreement that would otherwise result in upfront revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an mea when it is executed within close proximity, or in contemplation of, other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer, in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the mea instead of up front.
29
for an mea that includes software and nonsoftware elements, we allocate consideration to all software elements as a group and all nonsoftware elements based on their relative standalone selling prices. revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met. in these circumstances, there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows:
•   vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or vsoe;
•   third-party evidence of selling price, or tpe; and
•   best estimate of the selling price, or besp.
we calculate the besp of our hardware products based on our pricing practices, including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products, because vsoe or tpe cannot be established. our process for determining besp for our software deliverables without vsoe or tpe takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. key external and internal factors considered in developing the besps include prices charged by us for similar arrangements, historical pricing practices and the nature of the product. in addition, when developing besps, we may consider other factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives. we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the besp of the deliverables in our arrangements.
business combinations when we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. these estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.
we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite-lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.
fair value of financial instruments on a quarterly basis, we measure at fair value certain financial assets and liabilities. inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions.
while we believe the observable and unobservable inputs we use to measure the fair value are reasonable, different inputs or estimates may materially impact the resulting fair value measurements of these instruments and may also impact our results of operations. for an additional description of our fair value measurements, see note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

results of operations financial results for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013 and 2012, reflect the following:
•   increased product and maintenance revenue, primarily because of increased business levels, incremental revenue from our acquisitions and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2014;
•   increased product and maintenance related costs consisting of costs associated with our emulation hardware, which experienced lower margins due to an increasingly competitive environment, and amortization of technology-related and maintenance-related acquired intangibles;
•   increased employee-related costs, primarily consisting of costs related to hiring additional employees, incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions, and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2014;
•   increased stock-based compensation;
•   increased amortization of acquired intangibles resulting from acquisitions;
•   restructuring charges due to restructuring activities during fiscal 2014 and 2013; and
•   severance and other termination costs primarily associated with a voluntary early retirement program we offered to certain of our employees during fiscal 2014.
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december 31. fiscal 2014 was a 53-week year compared to fiscal 2013 and 2012, which were 52-week years. as noted above, revenue and expenses included in the results of operations for fiscal 2014 were impacted by the additional week.
revenue we primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and ip, selling or leasing our emulation hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, emulation hardware and ip, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our ip. the timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, emulation hardware and ip products in the bookings executed in any given period and whether the revenue for such bookings is recognized in a recurring manner over multiple periods or up front, upon completion of delivery.
we seek to achieve a consistent revenue mix such that approximately 90% of our revenue is recurring in nature, and the remainder of the resulting revenue is recognized up front, upon completion of delivery. recurring revenue includes revenue from our license arrangements where revenue is recognized over multiple periods, services, royalties from certain ip arrangements, maintenance on perpetual software licenses and emulation hardware, and our operating leases of emulation hardware. upfront revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation hardware and perpetual software licenses. our ability to achieve this mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by hardware sales. for an additional description of our current product strategy, see the discussion under the heading "products and product strategy" under part i, item 1, "business."
approximately 90% of the aggregate value of our revenue during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was of a type for which the revenue is recurring in nature.
we believe our reported revenue and the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things, the:
•   competitiveness of our technology; and
•   size, duration, timing, terms and type of:
•   contract renewals with existing customers;
•   additional sales to existing customers; and
•   sales to new customers.

product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, and during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily because of increased business levels, incremental revenue recognized from our acquisitions and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2014. the additional week of operations contributed approximately $15.0 million of revenue to fiscal 2014.
services revenue remained relatively constant during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, but decreased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily because of the redeployment of certain of our design services engineers to internal research and development projects related to our design ip activities. services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on demand for, and our resources to fulfill, our services and customized ip offerings.
no one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012.

as described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements, certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. for these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products. the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ.

most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar. however, certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the japanese yen. we recognize reduced revenue from those contracts in periods when the japanese yen weakens in value against the united states dollar and additional revenue from those contracts in periods when the japanese yen strengthens against the united states dollar. for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency risk."
revenue for asia increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, primarily due to increases in revenue from our software business and emulation hardware installations. for the primary factors contributing to our increase in revenue in other geographies, excluding japan, see the general description under "revenue by year," above.
revenue for japan decreased by approximately $20 million during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, and during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the continued depreciation of the japanese yen as well as difficult business conditions facing our japanese customers.

cost of product and maintenance depends primarily upon our emulation hardware product sales and gross margins in any given period. employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, and the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire or license third-parties' intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology also impact cost of product and maintenance.
the changes in product and maintenance-related costs were due to the following:
change
2014 vs. 2013            2013 vs. 2012
(in millions)
emulation hardware costs                                  $10.2                     $7.1
salary, benefits and other employee-related costs           1.5                     (4.5      )

$11.2                     $3.2
emulation hardware costs increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily as a result of incremental reserves on inventory and increased overhead. emulation hardware costs increased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to a higher volume of emulation hardware products sold. gross margins on our emulation hardware products may fluctuate based on our pricing strategies, product competition and product life cycle. gross margins on our emulation hardware products decreased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, and during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012.
salary, benefits and other employee-related costs increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to an increase in compensation, including variable compensation, for existing employees. salary, benefits and other employee-related costs decreased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to redeployment of certain customer support employees to sales support roles.
amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, and during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions. we expect amortization of acquired intangibles to increase for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with our fiscal 2014 acquisitions. for an additional description of our expected amortization of intangible assets, see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
cost of services cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. cost of services will fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects or on internal development projects.
the decrease of $4.6 million in cost of services during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, was primarily due to an overall decrease in services revenue, lower variable compensation and a decrease in the use of third-party contractors.
34
operating expenses our operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development and general and administrative expenses. factors that cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, foreign exchange rates, stock-based compensation and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by overall operating results.
our employee salary and other compensation-related costs included in marketing and sales and research and development increased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, and during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to our ip-related research and development activities, sales activities and incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions. our employee salary and other compensation-related costs included in general and administrative decreased during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to a decrease in acquisition-related compensation costs. employee salary and other compensation-related costs included in general and administrative increased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions.
stock-based compensation included in operating expenses increased $17.5 million during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, and $18.7 million during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily because of higher grant-date fair values of stock awards.
during fiscal 2014, we initiated a voluntary early retirement program. the program was offered to certain eligible employees in north america and japan. we recorded costs associated with this program of approximately $9.7 million in our operating expenses during fiscal 2014.
we expect our operating expenses to generally increase during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to expected hiring of additional employees during fiscal 2015 and because fiscal 2015 will include a full year of operating expenses for additional research and development and sales personnel added during fiscal 2014 through hiring and our fiscal 2014 acquisitions. we also expect stock-based compensation included in operating expenses to increase during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, due to amortization during fiscal 2015 of unrecognized expense related to unvested awards that generally have higher grant-date fair values compared to awards vested in previous years and amortization of new awards granted during fiscal 2015.
many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies. for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency risk."

restructuring and other charges we have initiated various restructuring plans to better align our resources with our business strategy, including a restructuring plan we initiated during fiscal 2014, or the 2014 restructuring plan, and a restructuring plan we initiated during fiscal 2013, or the 2013 restructuring plan. for an additional description of the 2014 restructuring plan and 2013 restructuring plan, see note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management's estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. demand for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future.
the following table presents restructuring and other charges (credits), net for our restructuring plans:

restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal 2014 consisted primarily of costs for severance and termination benefits and impairment of certain property, plant and equipment related to the 2014 restructuring plan. restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal 2013 consisted primarily of costs for severance and termination benefits related to the 2013 restructuring plan. restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal 2012 consisted primarily of adjustments to previous estimates of restructuring liabilities.

income taxes the following table presents the provision (benefit) for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012:

our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended january 3, 2015 primarily resulted from federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2014 income. our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower statutory tax rates than our united states earnings. our provision for income taxes included the tax benefit of $8.1 million resulting from the enactment of the united states research tax credit in december 2014.
our benefit for income taxes for the fiscal year ended december 28, 2013 primarily consisted of the following:
•   tax benefit of $33.7 million related to the release of an uncertain tax position from a previous business combination and the release of related interest and penalties; and
•   tax benefit of $12.8 million for the retroactively enacted fiscal 2012 federal research tax credit and for the fiscal 2013 research tax credit;
which were partially offset by:
•   federal, state and foreign tax expense on our fiscal 2013 income, and tax expense related to integrating our fiscal 2013 acquisitions.
38
our benefit for income taxes for fiscal 2012 primarily consisted of the following:
•   tax benefit from the release of year-end valuation allowance of $219.6 million against our united states deferred tax assets;
•   tax benefit of $36.7 million from the effective settlement of the state of california ftb's examination of our tax returns from 2001 through 2003;
•   tax benefit from the release of $14.8 million of valuation allowance against our united states deferred tax assets due to the acquisition of intangible assets held by sigrity during fiscal 2012;
which were partially offset by;
•   tax expense related to certain of our foreign subsidiaries; and
•   excess tax benefit from employee stock compensation that was allocated to equity.
our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the united states federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law. a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary. our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or if we were to repatriate certain foreign earnings on which united states taxes have not been previously accrued.
the law that authorized the united states federal research tax credit expired on december 31, 2014. unless a new law reinstates the federal research tax credit, we will not include the potential benefit of the federal research tax credit in our tax provision calculations for fiscal 2015. we currently expect that our fiscal 2015 effective tax rate will be higher than our fiscal 2014 effective tax rate.
for further discussion regarding our income taxes, see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

our primary sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2014 were customer payments for our products and services, proceeds from the issuance of our 4.375% senior notes due october 15, 2024, or the 2024 notes, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.
our primary uses of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2014 were payments relating to salaries, benefits, other employee-related costs and operating expenses, our fiscal 2014 acquisitions, payments on our revolving credit facility, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, purchases of property, plant and equipment, tax payments and payments related to our recent restructuring plans and voluntary early retirement program.
approximately 45% of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of january 3, 2015. after the repayment of the 2015 notes during fiscal 2015, the proportion of our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries will increase. our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from certain foreign operations. we do not anticipate we will need to repatriate dividends from foreign operations that are permanently reinvested in order to fund our domestic operations. in the event that dividends from foreign operations that are currently permanently reinvested are needed to fund united states liquidity, we could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes in order to repatriate these funds. for further discussion regarding our income taxes see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

we maintain an investment portfolio of approximately $100 million in marketable debt securities, including corporate debt securities, united states treasury securities, united states government agency securities, bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper. our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are included in short-term investments as of january 3, 2015. our investments are made in accordance with our cash investment policy, which governs the amounts and types of investments we hold in our portfolio. our investment portfolio could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including credit risk, interest rate risk and general market risk, as outlined in part i, item 1a, "risk factors."
we expect that current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, cash flows that are generated from operations, proceeds from our 2024 notes and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including servicing the maturity or conversion of our 2015 notes, acquisitions, if any, and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months.
net working capital net working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. the increase in our net working capital as of january 3, 2015, as compared to december 28, 2013, is primarily due to higher cash balances resulting from the issuance of our 2024 notes.
cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:
change
2014                                                    2013                2012                   2014 vs. 2013           2013 vs. 2012
(in millions)
cash provided by operating activities      $316.7              $367.6              $316.0          $(50.9        )         $51.6
cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our license agreements.
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from customers, working capital requirements, payments under our recent restructuring plans, payments for our voluntary early retirement program and an increase in cash paid for taxes, net of tax refunds. the increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, was primarily due to the timing of collections from customers and disbursements made to vendors.
if our customers experience adverse changes in the future, are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing, they may delay purchasing our products and services, or they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us, although these obligations are generally not cancelable. our customers' inability to fulfill payment obligations would adversely affect our cash flow. additionally, our customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments. though we have not experienced a material level of defaults, any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows from operations.
we expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including our operating results, tax payments and the timing of our billings, collections and disbursements.
cash flows from investing activities cash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

40
the decrease in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, was primarily due to the decrease in cash paid for business combinations. the increase in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for business combinations, offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities.
we expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, business combinations, purchasing software licenses, and making long-term equity investments.
cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of our 2024 notes, partially offset by payments made for the repurchase of our common stock. the decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, was primarily due to payments made to retire the remaining principal balance of the 2013 notes and the 2023 notes.
we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock during fiscal 2015. for an additional description of our share repurchase programs and repurchase authorizations, see part ii, item 5, "market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" and note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources
2024 notes on october 9, 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due october 15, 2024. we received net proceeds of $342.4 million from issuance of the 2024 notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. interest is payable in cash semi-annually commencing on april 15, 2015. the 2024 notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness.the proceeds from the 2024 notes are available for general corporate purposes, which may include the retirement of debt, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and strategic transactions.
revolving credit facility on september 19, 2014, we amended our senior revolving credit facility on terms substantially similar to the prior credit agreement, except that, as amended, our revolving credit facility (i) is unsecured, (ii) expires on september 19, 2019, (iii) has no subsidiary guarantors and (iv) includes certain amendments to the negative and financial covenants, such as modifications to provide additional flexibility, a reduction in cadence's basket for secured debt and a decrease in the maximum permitted funded debt to ebidta ratio from 3:1 to 2.75:1, subject to certain adjustments. our revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $250.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $150.0 million upon the receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $400.0 million.
convertible notes as of january 3, 2015, we had convertible notes outstanding with a net liability value of $342.5 million that mature on june 1, 2015. the total cash payable upon the early conversion of these notes, as determined by the indenture of each security, will be their principal amount plus any additional conversion value that would be due upon conversion.
we will owe additional cash to the note holders upon early conversion if our stock price exceeds $7.55 per share. we entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount of the 2015 notes that may be due to the holders upon conversion. in separate transactions, we sold the 2015 warrants with a strike price of $10.78 per share. although our incremental cash payout exposure above the conversion price is limited by the 2015 notes hedges to the outstanding principal value of the 2015 notes and accrued interest, we will experience dilution to our stock upon settlement of the 2015 warrants and to our diluted earnings per share from the outstanding 2015 warrants to the extent our average closing stock price exceeds $10.78 in any fiscal quarter until the 2015 warrants are settled.
41
additionally, holders may elect to convert their 2015 notes into cash at any time through the second trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. if the holders of our 2015 notes elect to convert their notes into cash prior to maturity, we are required to pay the note holders cash equal to the principal amount of the notes converted plus any additional conversion value associated with the conversion feature. we will receive cash from the counterparties to the 2015 notes hedges for the value of the conversion feature upon settlement of the notes tendered. as of january 3, 2015, a total of $47.9 million of the 2015 notes had been tendered for early conversion, of which one thousand dollars principal value had been settled. subsequent to january 3, 2015, we received notifications for early conversion of an additional $6.0 million principal value of the 2015 notes, resulting in an aggregate amount of $53.9 million principal value of the 2015 notes having been tendered for conversion as of february 19, 2015.
we expect that cash generated from our operating activities, proceeds from our 2024 notes, and access to our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service the maturity or conversion of our 2015 notes. for an additional description of the 2015 notes, the conversion terms thereof and the hedge and warrants transactions, see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of january 3, 2015 is as follows:

(1)   with respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of january 3, 2015 or the earliest cancellation date.
(2)   holders of the 2015 notes may elect to convert their 2015 notes into cash at any time through the second trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. contractual interest payments associated with the 2015 notes are presented assuming the outstanding principal balance will be paid in full on the contractual maturity date. in connection with the 2015 notes, we entered into the 2015 notes hedges to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the $350.0 million principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 notes. the 2015 notes embedded conversion derivative liability, which represents the cash conversion value of the 2015 notes, has not been included because cadence will receive cash in an equal amount from the 2015 notes hedges to settle the obligation upon conversion.
(3)   included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $18.5 million that we estimate will be paid or settled within 3 to 5 years. the remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.
in connection with our acquisitions completed before january 3, 2015, we are obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $10.0 million in cash over the next 15 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of january 3, 2015, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.

new accounting standards on may 28, 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under united states generally accepted accounting principles. the updated standard will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. early adoption is not permitted. we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
we periodically review new accounting standards. although some of the accounting standards that have been issued may be applicable to us, we have not identified any other new accounting standards that would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

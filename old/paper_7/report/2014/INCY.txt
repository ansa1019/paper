license agreements novartis in november 2009, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with novartis. under the terms of the agreement, novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the united states to ruxolitinib and certain back-up compounds for hematologic and oncology indications, including all hematological malignancies, solid tumors and myeloproliferative diseases. we retained exclusive development and commercialization rights to jakafi (ruxolitinib) in the united states and in certain other indications. novartis also received worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to our c-met inhibitor compound capmatinib and certain back-up compounds in all indications. we retained options to co-develop and to co-promote capmatinib in the united states.
under this agreement, we received an upfront payment and immediate milestone payment totaling $210.0 million and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to approximately $1.2 billion if defined development and commercialization milestones are achieved. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, we received $92.0 million, $25.0 million and $40.0 million, respectively, in milestone payments under this agreement. we are also eligible to receive tiered, double-digit royalties ranging from the upper-teens to the mid-twenties on future ruxolitinib net sales outside of the united states. in addition, novartis has received reimbursement and pricing approval for ruxolitinib in a specified number of countries, and we are now obligated to pay to novartis tiered royalties in the low single digits on future ruxolitinib net sales within the united states. each company is responsible for costs relating to the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib in its respective territories, with costs of collaborative studies shared equally. novartis is now responsible for all costs relating to the development and commercialization of capmatinib. jakafi is sold outside of the united states by novartis under the name jakavi. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded $49.0 million, $28.3 million and $3.7 million, respectively, of product royalty revenues related to novartis net sales of jakavi.
the novartis agreement will continue on a program-by-program basis until novartis has no royalty payment obligations with respect to such program or, if earlier, the termination of the agreement or any program in accordance with the terms of the agreement. royalties are payable by novartis on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of (1) the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights covering the licensed product in the relevant country, (2) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the licensed product in such country and (3) a specified period from
53
first commercial sale in such country of the licensed product by novartis or its affiliates or sublicensees. the agreement may be terminated in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis by novartis for convenience. the agreement may also be terminated by either party under certain other circumstances, including material breach.
lilly in december 2009, we entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with lilly. under the terms of the agreement, lilly received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to baricitinib and certain back-up compounds for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. we received an initial payment of $90.0 million, and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to $665.0 million based on the achievement of defined development, regulatory and commercialization milestones. in 2012, we recognized a $50.0 million milestone under this agreement, and in 2010, we received $49.0 million in milestone payments under this agreement. we also could receive tiered, double-digit royalty payments on future global net sales with rates ranging up to 20% if the product is successfully commercialized.
we retained options to co-develop our jak1/jak2 inhibitors with lilly on a compound-by-compound and indication-by-indication basis. lilly is responsible for all costs relating to the development and commercialization of the compounds unless we elect to co-develop any compounds or indications. if we elect to co-develop any compounds and/or indications, we would be responsible for funding 30% of the associated future global development costs from the initiation of a phase iib trial through regulatory approval. we would receive an incremental royalty rate increase across all tiers resulting in effective royalty rates ranging up to the high twenties on potential future global net sales for compounds and/or indications that we elect to co-develop. we also retained an option to co-promote products in the united states. in july 2010, we elected to co-develop baricitinib with lilly in rheumatoid arthritis and we are responsible for funding 30% of the associated future global development costs for this indication from the initiation of the phase iib trial through regulatory approval. baricitinib is also being developed in psoriasis and diabetic nephropathy. we have decided not to exercise our co-development option for psoriasis. the lilly agreement will continue until lilly no longer has any royalty payment obligations or, if earlier, the termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms. royalties are payable by lilly on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of (1) the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights covering the licensed product in the relevant country, (2) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the licensed product in such country and (3) a specified period from first commercial sale in such country of the licensed product by lilly or its affiliates or sublicensees. the agreement may be terminated by lilly for convenience, and may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including material breach.
agenus in january 2015, we entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with agenus inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, 4-antibody ag, which we collectively refer to as agenus. under this agreement, the parties have agreed to collaborate on the discovery of novel immuno-therapeutics using agenus' proprietary retrocyte display antibody discovery platform. the effectiveness of the agreement is conditioned on the expiration of the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 (hsr act).
under the terms of this agreement, we received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to four checkpoint modulators directed against gitr, ox40, lag-3 and tim-3. in addition to the initial four program targets, we and agenus have the option to jointly nominate and pursue additional targets within the framework of the collaboration. these targets may be designated profit-share programs, where all costs and profits are shared equally by us and agenus, or royalty-bearing programs, where we will be responsible for all costs associated with discovery, preclinical activities, clinical
54
development and commercialization activities. the programs relating to gitr and ox40 are profit-share programs and the programs relating to lag-3 and tim-3 are royalty-bearing programs. all costs related to the collaboration are subject to a joint research plan. we agreed to pay agenus upfront non-refundable payments totaling $25.0 million. for each royalty-bearing product, agenus will be eligible to receive up to $155.0 million in future contingent development, regulatory and commercialization milestones as well as tiered royalties on global net sales ranging from 6% to 12%. for each profit-share product, agenus will be eligible to receive up to $20.0 million in future contingent development milestones. additionally, agenus retains co-promotion participation rights in the united states on any profit-share product. for each royalty-bearing product, agenus has reserved the right to elect to co-fund 30% of development costs for a commensurate increase in royalties. the agreement may be terminated by us for convenience and may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including material breach. we have agreed to certain standstill provisions that allow us to acquire up to 15% of agenus inc.'s outstanding voting stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the stock purchase agreement described below, solely for investment purposes.
we also entered into a stock purchase agreement with agenus inc., pursuant to which we agreed to purchase, subject to expiration of the waiting period under the hsr act, approximately 7.76 million shares of agenus inc. common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $35.0 million in cash, or approximately $4.51 per share. we will own approximately 11% of the outstanding shares of agenus inc.'s common stock after such purchase. we have agreed not to dispose of any of the shares of common stock for a period of 12 months and agenus inc. has agreed to certain registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock.
pfizer in january 2006, we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer inc. for the pursuit of our ccr2 antagonist program. pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of ccr2 antagonist compounds. pfizer's rights extend to the full scope of potential indications, with the exception of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune nephritides, where we retained worldwide rights, along with certain compounds. we do not have obligations to pfizer on pre-clinical development candidates we select for pursuit in these indications. the agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last to expire of patent rights licensed under the agreement. prior to such expiration, either party can terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or for the insolvency of the other party. in addition, pfizer may terminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days' notice. we received an upfront nonrefundable, non-creditable payment of $40.0 million in january 2006 and are eligible to receive additional future development and milestone payments. we received a $3.0 million milestone payment from pfizer in 2010.
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
혮 revenue recognition;
혮 research and development costs;
55
혮 stock compensation;
혮 investments;
혮 inventory; and
혮 convertible debt accounting revenue recognition.    revenues are recognized when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the price is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or until no further obligations exist. we exercise judgment in determining that collectability is reasonably assured or that services have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement. we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. we assess collectability based primarily on the customer's payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer. our product revenues consist of u.s. sales of jakafi and are recognized once we meet all four revenue recognition criteria described above. in november 2011, we began shipping jakafi to our specialty pharmacy customers, which in turn dispense jakafi to patients in fulfillment of prescriptions.
we recognize revenues for product received by our specialty pharmacy customers net of allowances for customer credits, including estimated rebates, chargebacks, discounts, returns, distribution service fees, patient assistance programs, and medicare part d coverage gap reimbursements. product shipping and handling costs are included in cost of product revenues.
customer credits:    our specialty pharmacy customers are offered various forms of consideration, including allowances, service fees and prompt payment discounts. we expect our specialty pharmacy customers will earn prompt payment discounts and, therefore, we deduct the full amount of these discounts from total product sales when revenues are recognized. service fees are also deducted from total product sales as they are earned.
rebates:    allowances for rebates include mandated discounts under the medicaid drug rebate program. rebate amounts are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector (e.g., medicaid) benefit providers. rebates are amounts owed after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant and are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector benefit providers. the accrual for rebates is based on statutory discount rates and expected utilization as well as historical data we have accumulated since product launch. our estimates for expected utilization of rebates are based on data received from our specialty pharmacy customers. rebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter's activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters' unpaid rebates. if actual future rebates vary from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
chargebacks:    chargebacks are discounts that occur when contracted customers purchase directly from a specialty pharmacy, or an intermediary distributor. contracted customers, which currently consist primarily of public health service institutions, non-profit clinics, and federal government entities purchasing via the federal supply schedule, generally purchase the product at a discounted price. the specialty pharmacy or distributor, in turn, charges back to us the difference between the price initially paid by the specialty pharmacy or distributor and the discounted price paid to the specialty pharmacy or distributor by the customer. the accrual for chargebacks is based on the estimated contractual discounts on the inventory levels on hand in our distribution channel. if actual future chargebacks vary from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
56
medicare part d coverage gap:    medicare part d prescription drug benefit mandates manufacturers to fund 50% of the medicare part d insurance coverage gap for prescription drugs sold to eligible patients. our estimates for the expected medicare part d coverage gap are based on historical invoices received and in part from data received from our specialty pharmacy customers. funding of the coverage gap is generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter's activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters. if actual future funding varies from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
co-payment assistance:    patients who have commercial insurance and meet certain eligibility requirements may receive co-payment assistance. we accrue a liability for co-payment assistance based on actual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by third-party administrators.
product royalty revenues royalty revenues on commercial sales for jakavi by novartis are estimated based on information provided by novartis. we exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon. if actual royalties vary from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period which would affect royalty revenue in the period of adjustment.
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues includes all jakafi related costs that are recoverable through the commercialization of the product. beginning in october 2014, we became obligated to pay tiered, low-single digit royalties to novartis on all future sales of jakafi in the united states, which are included in cost of product revenues.
contract and license revenues under agreements involving multiple deliverables, services and/or rights to use assets that we entered into prior to january 1, 2011, the multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered items have stand-alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. when separate units of accounting exist, consideration is allocated among the separate elements based on their respective fair values. the determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from historical sales of the individual elements by us to other customers. if such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value for each undelivered element does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered. when elements are specifically tied to a separate earnings process, revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation tied to the element is completed. when revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings process, they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. we assess whether a substantive milestone exists at the inception of our agreements. for all milestones within our arrangements that are considered substantive, we recognize revenue upon the achievement of the associated milestone. if a milestone is not considered substantive, we would recognize the applicable milestone payment over the remaining period of performance under the arrangement. as of december 31, 2014, all remaining potential milestones under our collaborative arrangements are considered substantive.
on january 1, 2011, updated guidance on the recognition of revenues for agreements with multiple deliverables became effective and applies to any agreements we may enter into on or after january 1, 2011. this updated guidance (i) relates to whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables in a revenue
57
arrangement should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated; (ii) requires companies to allocate revenues in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price; and (iii) eliminates the use of the residual method and requires companies to allocate revenues using the relative selling price method. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we did not enter into any agreements that are subject to this updated guidance. if we enter into an agreement with multiple deliverables after january 1, 2011 or amend existing agreements, this updated guidance could have a material effect on our financial statements.
our collaborations often include contractual milestones, which typically relate to the achievement of pre-specified development, regulatory and commercialization events. these three categories of milestone events reflect the three stages of the life-cycle of our drugs, which we describe in more detail in the following paragraphs.
the regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each drug candidate, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. securing approval by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the fda for each indication to establish a drug candidate's safety and efficacy. the approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources, involves post-marketing surveillance and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies. before commencing clinical investigations of a drug candidate in humans, we must submit an investigational new drug application (ind), which must be reviewed by the fda.
the steps generally required before a drug may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, submission to the fda of an ind for human clinical testing, performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in three phases, as described below, to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication, submission of a new drug application (nda) or biologics license application (bla) to the fda for review and fda approval of the nda or bla.
similar requirements exist within foreign regulatory agencies as well. the time required satisfying the fda requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies may vary substantially based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product or the targeted disease.
preclinical testing includes laboratory evaluation of product pharmacology, drug metabolism, and toxicity, which includes animal studies, to assess potential safety and efficacy as well as product chemistry, stability, formulation, development, and testing. the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the fda as part of an ind. the fda may raise safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials included in the ind, and any of these concerns or questions must be resolved before clinical trials can proceed. we cannot be sure that submission of an ind will result in the fda allowing clinical trials to commence. clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug or the marketed drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators and in accordance with good clinical practices regulations covering the protection of human subjects. clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. phase i usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into healthy volunteers to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. phase ii usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the drug for specific indications. phase iii clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and safety by testing the drug in its final form in an expanded patient population, providing statistical evidence of efficacy and safety, and providing an adequate basis for labeling. we cannot guarantee that phase i, phase ii or phase iii testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. furthermore, we, the institutional review board for a trial, or
58
the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
generally, the milestone events contained in our collaboration agreements coincide with the progression of our drugs from development, to regulatory approval and then to commercialization. the process of successfully discovering a new development candidate, having it approved and successfully commercialized is highly uncertain. as such, the milestone payments we may earn from our partners involve a significant degree of risk to achieve. therefore, as a drug candidate progresses through the stages of its life-cycle, the value of the drug candidate generally increases.
research and development costs.    our policy is to expense research and development costs as incurred. we often contract with clinical research organizations (cros) to facilitate, coordinate and perform agreed upon research and development of a new drug. to ensure that research and development costs are expensed as incurred, we record monthly accruals for clinical trials and preclinical testing costs based on the work performed under the contract.
these cro contracts typically call for the payment of fees for services at the initiation of the contract and/or upon the achievement of certain clinical trial milestones. in the event that we prepay cro fees, we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and development expense over the period of time the contracted research and development services are performed. most professional fees, including project and clinical management, data management, monitoring, and medical writing fees are incurred throughout the contract period. these professional fees are expensed based on their percentage of completion at a particular date. our cro contracts generally include pass through fees. pass through fees include, but are not limited to, regulatory expenses, investigator fees, travel costs, and other miscellaneous costs, including shipping and printing fees. we expense the costs of pass through fees under our cro contracts as they are incurred, based on the best information available to us at the time. the estimates of the pass through fees incurred are based on the amount of work completed for the clinical trial and are monitored through correspondence with the cros, internal reviews and a review of contractual terms. the factors utilized to derive the estimates include the number of patients enrolled, duration of the clinical trial, estimated patient attrition, screening rate and length of the dosing regimen. cro fees incurred to set up the clinical trial are expensed during the setup period.
under our clinical trial collaboration agreements, we may be reimbursed for certain development costs incurred. such costs are recorded as a reduction of research and development expense in the period in which the related expense is incurred.
stock compensation.    share-based payment transactions with employees, which include stock options, restricted stock units (rsus) and performance shares (psus), are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their estimated fair values on the dates of grant. the stock compensation process requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding black-scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility over the option term and expected option lives, as well as expected forfeiture rates and the probability of psus vesting. the fair value of stock options, which are subject to graded vesting, are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. the fair value of rsus, which are generally subject to cliff vesting, are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the straight line attribution method. the fair value of psus are recognized as compensation expense beginning at the time in which the performance conditions are deemed probable of achievement, over the remaining requisite service period. we recorded $62.2 million, $38.4 million and $38.5 million of stock compensation expense for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
investments.    we carry our investments at their respective fair values. we periodically evaluate the fair values of our investments to determine whether any declines in the fair value of investments represent an other-than-temporary impairment. this evaluation consists of a review of several factors, including the
59
length of time and extent that a security has been in an unrealized loss position, the existence of an event that would impair the issuer's future repayment potential, the near term prospects for recovery of the market value of a security and if we intend to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. if management determines that such an impairment exists, we would recognize an impairment charge. because we may determine that market or business conditions may lead us to sell our marketable securities prior to maturity, we classify our marketable securities as "available-for-sale." investments in securities that are classified as available-for-sale and have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair market value in the balance sheets, and unrealized holding gains and losses for these investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity until realized. we classify marketable securities that are available for use in current operations as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
inventory.    inventories are determined at the lower of cost or market value with cost determined under the specific identification method and may consist of raw materials, work in process and finished goods. we began capitalizing inventory in mid-november 2011 once the fda approved jakafi as the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product. costs incurred prior to approval of jakafi have been recorded as research and development expense in our statements of operations. as a result, cost of product revenues for approximately the next 21 to 24 months will reflect a lower average per unit cost of materials.
the raw materials and work-in-process inventory is not subject to expiration and the shelf life for finished goods inventory is 36 months from the start of manufacturing of the finished goods. we evaluate for potential excess inventory by analyzing current and future product demand relative to the remaining product shelf life. we build demand forecasts by considering factors such as, but not limited to, overall market potential, market share, market acceptance and patient usage. we classify inventory as current on the consolidated balance sheets when we expect inventory to be consumed for commercial use within the next twelve months.
convertible debt accounting.    we perform an assessment of all embedded features of a debt instrument to determine if (1) such features should be bifurcated and separately accounted for, and (2) if bifurcation requirements are met, whether such features should be classified and accounted for as equity or liability instruments. if the embedded feature meets the requirements to be bifurcated and accounted for as a liability, the fair value of the embedded feature is measured initially, included as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet, and re-measured to fair value at each reporting period. any changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. we monitor, on an ongoing basis, whether events or circumstances could give rise to a change in our classification of embedded features.
we determined the embedded conversion options in the 0.375% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the 2018 notes) and the 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 notes) are not required to be separately accounted for as derivatives. however, since the 2018 notes and the 2020 notes can be settled in cash or common shares or a combination of cash and common shares at our option, we are required to separate the 2018 notes and 2020 notes into a liability and equity component. the carrying amount of the liability component is calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component. the carrying amount of the equity component representing the embedded conversion option is determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the initial proceeds. the excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount is amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the 2018 notes and 2020 notes using the effective interest method. the equity component is not re-measured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification for contracts in an entity's own equity.
the fair value of the liability component of the 2018 notes was estimated at $299.4 million at issuance. therefore, the difference between the $375.0 million face value of the 2018 notes and the $299.4 million
60
estimated fair value of the liability component will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2018 notes through november 15, 2018 using the effective interest method.
the fair value of the liability component of the 2020 notes was estimated at $274.8 million at issuance. therefore, the difference between the $375.0 million face value of the 2020 notes and the $274.8 million estimated fair value of the liability component will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 notes through november 15, 2020 using the effective interest method.
the estimated fair value of the liability components at the date of issuance for the 2018 notes and 2020 notes were determined using valuation models and are complex and subject to judgment. significant assumptions within the valuation models included an implied credit spread, the expected volatility and dividend yield of our common stock and the risk free interest rate for notes with a similar term.
prior to may 14, 2014, the 2018 notes and 2020 notes were not convertible except in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, as defined in the respective indentures. beginning on, and including, may 15, 2014, the 2018 notes and 2020 notes are convertible prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding may 15, 2018, in the case of the 2018 notes, and may 15, 2020, in the case of the 2020 notes, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on march 31, 2014 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the 2018 notes or 2020 notes, as applicable, on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2018 notes or 2020 notes, as applicable, for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2018 notes or 2020 notes, as applicable, on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. on or after may 15, 2018, in the case of the 2018 notes, and may 15, 2020, in the case of the 2020 notes, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the relevant maturity date, the notes are convertible at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. upon conversion we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election.
on a quarterly basis, we perform an assessment in order to determine whether the 2018 notes or 2020 notes have become convertible at the option of the holder, based on meeting any of the conversion criteria described above. should either the 2018 notes or the 2020 notes become convertible, we then assess our intent and ability to settle the 2018 notes or the 2020 notes in cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, in order to determine the appropriate classification of the 2018 notes and the 2020 notes at the balance sheet date. on january 1, 2015, the 2018 notes and 2020 notes became convertible through at least march 31, 2015, based on meeting the conversion criteria related to the sale price of our common stock during the calendar quarter ended december 31, 2014 as described above. management's intent is to settle any conversions of 2018 notes or 2020 notes in common shares and, therefore, the 2018 and 2020 notes are reflected in long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014.

our product revenues, net from jakafi for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, were $357.6 million and $235.4 million, respectively. this increase was comprised of a volume increase of $92.3 million and a price increase of $29.9 million. product revenues from the sale of jakafi are recorded net of estimated product returns, pricing discounts including rebates offered pursuant to mandatory federal and state government programs and chargebacks, prompt pay discounts and distribution fees and co-pay assistance. our revenue recognition policies require estimates of the aforementioned sales allowances each period.
the following table provides a summary of activity with respect to our sales allowances and accruals for the year ended december 31, 2014:

government rebates and chargebacks are the most significant component of our sales allowances. increases in certain government reimbursement rates are limited to a measure of inflation, and when the price of a drug increases faster than this measure of inflation it will result in a penalty adjustment factor that causes a larger sales allowance to those government related entities. we expect government rebates and chargebacks as a percentage of our gross product sales will continue to increase in connection with any future jakafi price increases greater than the rate of inflation, and any such increase in these government rebates and chargebacks will have a negative impact on our reported product revenues, net.
we expect our sales allowances to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the medicare part d coverage gap, the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates as well as changes in discount percentages which are impacted by potential future price increases, rate of inflation, and other factors.

product royalty revenues on commercial sales for jakavi by novartis are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by novartis. our net product royalty revenues for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, were $49.0 million and $28.3 million, respectively. future product royalty revenues on commercial sales for jakavi by novartis could be impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
our contract revenues were $104.8 million and $91.0 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, contract revenues were derived from the straight line recognition of revenue associated with the novartis and lilly upfront fees over the estimated performance periods as well as milestone payments earned during the periods. the upfront fees related to the novartis agreement included a $150.0 million upfront payment received in 2009, a $60.0 million immediate milestone payment received in 2010 and $10.9 million of reimbursable costs incurred prior to the effective date of the agreement. the upfront fees related to the lilly agreement consisted of a $90.0 million upfront payment received in 2010. the increase from 2013 to 2014 primarily relates to recognition of $92.0 million in milestone payments from novartis in 2014 compared to the recognition of $25.0 from novartis in 2013 and $53.2 million of amortization of the novartis upfront payment in 2013, through the substantive completion date of our performance obligation with novartis.
cost of product revenues we began capitalizing inventory in mid-november 2011 once the fda approved jakafi as the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product. costs incurred prior to fda approval of $9.6 million were recorded as research and development expenses in our statements of operations prior to commercialization of jakafi. at december 31, 2014, inventory with $2.3 million of product costs incurred prior to fda approval had not yet been sold. we expect to sell the pre-commercialization inventory over the next 24 months; however, the time period over which this inventory is consumed will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of future jakafi sales, and the ability to utilize inventory prior to its expiration date. as a result, cost of product revenues for the next 24 months will reflect a lower average per unit cost of materials. commencing in october 2014, we became obligated to pay tiered, low-single digit royalties to novartis on all sales of jakafi in the united states, which is included in cost of product revenues.
cost of product revenues was $3.0 million and $0.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. cost of product revenues increased from 2013 to 2014 due to increased jakafi sales and our obligation that commenced in october 2014 to pay royalties to novartis on all jakafi sales in the united states. we expect future cost of product revenues to range in the mid-single digits as a percentage of net product sales subsequent to the utilization of all of the remaining pre-launch inventory.

we currently account for research and development costs by natural expense line and not costs by project. salary and benefits related expense increased from 2013 to 2014 due primarily to increased development headcount to sustain our development pipeline. stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of options granted, stock price volatility and expected option lives, as well as expected option forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation. the increase in clinical research and outside services expense from 2013 to 2014 was primarily the result of increased development costs. research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 were net of $4.3 million, $5.1 million, respectively, of costs reimbursed by our collaborative partners. research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre-clinical and clinical trial related activities. many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials, including requests by regulatory agencies for more information, inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials, slow patient enrollment, adverse side effects among patients, insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our investigational drugs in our clinical trials. in addition, the development of all of our products will be subject to extensive governmental regulation. these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our products.
in july 2010, we elected to co-develop baricitinib with lilly in rheumatoid arthritis and we are responsible for funding 30% of the associated future global development costs for this indication from the initiation of the phase iib trial through regulatory approval. research and development expenses recorded under the lilly agreement representing 30% of the global development costs for baricitinib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis were $49.3 million and $52.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we have retained certain mechanisms to give us cost protection as baricitinib advances in clinical development. we can defer our portion of co-development study costs by indication if they exceed a predetermined level. this deferment would be credited against future milestones or royalties and we would still be eligible for the full incremental royalties related to the co-development option. in addition, even if we have started co-development funding for any indication, we can at any time opt out, which will stop future co-development cost sharing. if we elect to do this we would still be eligible for our base royalties plus an incremental pro-rated royalty commensurate with our contribution to the total co-development cost for those indications for which we contributed funding.

prior to the three months ended september 30, 2012, we used the sell- through method for revenue recognition as we had limited historical data on product returns. under the sell-through method, we deferred revenue until the patients received jakafi. in the three months ended september 30, 2012, we determined that we had sufficient experience with product returns and transitioned to the sell-in method for recognizing revenue, under which we recognize revenue for product sales of jakafi at the time the product is received by our specialty pharmacy customers.

we had net losses from inception in 1991 through 1996 and in 1999 through december 31, 2014. because of those losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2014. we have funded our research and development operations through sales of equity securities, the issuance of convertible notes, cash received from customers, and collaborative arrangements. at december 31, 2014, we had available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $600.3 million. our cash and marketable securities balances are held in a variety of interest-bearing instruments, including money market accounts, corporate debt securities and u.s. government agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities. available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy's primary objectives of liquidity, safety of principal and diversity of investments.
cash provided by (used in) operating activities.    the $17.1 million increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2013 to 2014 was due primarily due a lower net loss, increased non-cash depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital. the $104.0 million decrease in cash used in operating activities from 2012 to 2013 was due primarily to timing of milestone receipts in 2013 and other changes in working capital.
cash used in investing activities.    our investing activities, other than purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and sales and purchases of long-term investments. in the future, net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of strategic equity investments, acquisitions and capital expenditures and maturities/sales and purchases of marketable securities.
cash provided by financing activities.    during 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $93.1 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan. during 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was $275.6 million, consisting of $728.7 million of net proceeds from the issuance of our 2018 notes and our 2020 notes and

$73.2 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan, offset by $500.0 million related to the repurchase of $117.3 million aggregate principal amount of our 2015 notes, $11.5 million related to the exchange of $186.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2015 notes for the underlying shares of common stock and cash, and $15.0 million related to a letter of credit for the facility lease for the benefit of the landlord. during 2012, net cash provided by financing activities was $47.7 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan.
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31, 2014 and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions):

contractual obligations:
principal on convertible senior debt       $840.9          $90.9           $혰            $375.0          $375.0
interest on convertible senior debt        38.1            10.4            12.2          10.8            4.7
non-cancelable lease obligations:
related to corporate headquarters          88.5            6.7             12.0          12.1            57.7
total contractual obligations              $967.5          $108.0          $24.2         $397.9          $437.4
we have entered into and may in the future seek to license additional rights relating to technologies or drug development candidates in connection with our drug discovery and development programs. under these licenses, we may be required to pay up-front fees, milestone payments, and royalties on sales of future products. the table above does not reflect any future potential payments, including the agenus upfront payment of $25.0 million and related stock purchase of $35.0 million which we expect to make in the first quarter of 2015.
we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including our expenditures in connection with our drug discovery and development programs and commercialization operations; expenditures in connection with litigation or other legal proceedings; competing technological and market developments; the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; our receipt of any milestone or other payments under any collaborative agreements we may enter into, including the agreements with novartis, lilly and pfizer; the extent to which commercialization of jakafi is successful; expenditures in connection with potential exchanges of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and expenditures in connection with strategic relationships and license agreements, including our agreement with agenus, strategic equity investments or potential acquisitions. changes in our research and development or commercialization plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources.
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenues to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic collaborations. the sale of equity or additional convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders, and may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our holders of common stock. debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness. we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to scale back our operations, delay or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, or attempt to obtain funds by entering into an agreement with a collaborator or licensee that would result in
69
terms that are not favorable to us or relinquishing our rights in certain of our proprietary technologies or drug candidates.
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than those that are discussed above.

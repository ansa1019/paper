item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
general eldorado resorts, inc. ("eri" or the "company"), a nevada corporation, was formed in september 2014 to be the parent company following the merger of wholly owned subsidiaries of the company into eldorado holdco llc ("holdco"), a nevada limited liability company formed in 2009 that is the parent company of eldorado resorts llc ("resorts"), and mtr gaming group, inc. ("mtr gaming"), a delaware corporation incorporated in 1988 (the "merger"). effective upon the consummation of the merger on september 19, 2014 (the "merger date"), mtr gaming and holdco each became a wholly owned subsidiary of eri and, as a result of such transactions, resorts became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of eri.
resorts owns and operates eldorado shreveport, a hotel and riverboat gaming complex that includes a 403-room, all suite, art deco-style hotel and a tri-level riverboat dockside casino situated on the red river in shreveport, louisiana ("eldorado shreveport") and the eldorado reno, a premier hotel, casino and entertainment facility in reno, nevada ("eldorado reno"). resorts owns the eldorado shreveport indirectly through two wholly owned subsidiaries which own 100% of the partnership interests in the eldorado shreveport joint venture, a louisiana general partnership ("louisiana partnership"). in addition, resorts owns a 48.1% interest in a joint venture ("silver legacy joint venture") which owns the silver legacy resort casino ("silver legacy"), a major, themed hotel/casino connected via a skywalk to the eldorado reno. resorts also previously owned a 21.3% interest in tamarack junction, a small casino in south reno. on september 1, 2014, and as a condition to closing the merger, resorts distributed to holdco, and holdco subsequently distributed to its members on a pro rata basis, all of resorts' interest in tamarack. the distribution resulted in no gain or loss being recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the distribution was in the amount of $5.5 million which was the book value of tamarack.
mtr gaming operates as a hospitality and gaming company with racetrack, gaming and hotel properties in west virginia, pennsylvania and ohio. mtr gaming, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, owns and operates mountaineer casino, racetrack & resort in chester, west virginia ("mountaineer"), presque isle downs & casino in erie, pennsylvania ("presque isle downs"), and scioto downs in columbus, ohio. scioto downs, through its subsidiary racelinebet, inc., also operates racelinebet.com, a national account wagering service that offers online and telephone wagering on horse races as a marketing affiliate of twinspires.com, an affiliate of churchill downs, inc.
eri, holdco and mtr gaming are collectively referred to as "we," "us," "our" or the "company." the merger closed on the merger date and has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of mtr gaming by holdco under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. as a result, holdco is considered the acquirer of mtr gaming for accounting purposes. the financial information included in this item 7 for periods prior to the merger date are those of resorts and its subsidiaries. the presentation of information herein for periods prior to the merger date and after the merger date are not fully comparable because the results of operations for mtr gaming are not included for periods prior to the merger date. summary financial results of mtr gaming for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 are included in mtr gaming's annual report on form 10-k as filed with the securities and exchange commission ("sec").
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide information to assist in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. we recommend that you read this md&a in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this annual report.

significant factors impacting operating trends key performance metrics our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers visiting and staying at our properties. key performance metrics include volume indicators such as table games drop and slot handle, which refer to amounts wagered by our customers. the amount of volume we retain, which is not fully controllable by us, is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold. in addition, hotel occupancy and price per room designated by average daily rate ("adr") are key indicators for our hotel business. our calculation of adr consists of the average price of occupied rooms per day including the impact of complimentary rooms. complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or cash rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates. complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions. complimentary rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy.
economic impact the economic downturn and the uneven recovery from the downturn continue to adversely influence consumers' confidence, discretionary spending levels and travel patterns. high unemployment and the record number of home foreclosures experienced in the economic downturn, increased competition and volatility of the economy have had, and continue to have, a significant negative impact on the gaming and tourism industries, and, as a result, our operating performance over the past several years. in response to the impact of the economic down turn, increased competition and other market factors on our business, our management has implemented cost savings measures and will continue to review our operations to look for opportunities to further reduce expenses and maximize cash flows. while there has been some improvement in the economy, we believe the impact of the economic downturn and the continuing uneven recovery may continue to negatively affect our operating results for some period of time. we remain uncertain as to the duration and magnitude of the impact of such factors on our operations and the length and sustainability of the recovery from the economic downturn.
expansion of native american gaming and regional gaming our business has been adversely impacted by the expansion of native american gaming and the expansion of gaming in our markets, including ohio. future growth of native american and other gaming establishments, including the addition of hotel rooms and other amenities, would place additional competitive pressure on our operations. while we cannot predict the extent of any future impact, it could be significant.
eldorado reno.    a significant portion of our revenues and operating income are generated from patrons who are residents of northern california and northeastern texas, and as such, our operations have been adversely impacted by the growth in native american gaming in northern california and, to a lesser extent, in oklahoma.
many existing native american gaming facilities in northern california are modest compared to eldorado reno. however, a number of native american tribes have established large-scale gaming facilities in california and some native american tribes have announced that they are in the process of expanding, developing, or are considering establishing, large-scale hotel and gaming facilities in northern california. as northern california native american gaming operations have expanded, we believe the increasing competition generated by these gaming operations has had a negative impact, principally on drive-in, day-trip visitor traffic from our main feeder markets in northern california.
38
under their current compacts, most native american tribes in california may operate up to 2,000 slot machines and up to two gaming facilities on any one reservation. however, under action taken by the national indian gaming commission, gaming devices similar in appearance to slot machines, but which are deemed to be technological enhancements to bingo style gaming, are not subject to such limits and may be used by tribes without state permission. the number of slot machines the tribes may be allowed to operate could increase as a result of any new or amended compacts the tribes may enter into with the state of california that receive the requisite approvals. such increases have occurred with respect to a number of new or amended compacts which have been executed and approved.
eldorado shreveport.    casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveport/bossier city market draws customers, primarily texas. although casino gaming is currently not permitted in texas, the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to authorize casino gaming and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. eldorado shreveport competes with several native american casinos located in oklahoma, certain of which are located near our core texas markets. because we draw a significant amount of our customers from the dallas/fort worth area, but are located approximately 190 miles from that area, we believe we will continue to face increased competition from gaming operations in oklahoma, including the winstar and choctaw casinos, and would face significant competition that may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations if casino gaming is approved in texas. in june 2013, construction was completed on a new 30,000 square foot casino and 400-room hotel in bossier city across the red river from eldorado shreveport. the facility, which also includes several restaurants and a 1,000-seat entertainment arena, received final approval from the louisiana gaming control board and opened on june 15, 2013. in december 2014, a new luxury, land-based casino with 1,600 slot machines, 72 gaming tables, a poker room, and a 740-room hotel with a ballroom and spa, opened in lake charles, louisiana approximately 200 miles south of eldorado shreveport, but closer to the houston, texas market. in addition, a new 320,000 square foot gaming facility located in sonoma county, california opened on november 5, 2013.
mtr gaming.    all of mtr gaming's properties experience varying competitive pressures, from casinos in western pennsylvania, western new york, northern west virginia and eastern ohio. we believe the expansion of gaming in ohio, which includes casinos that opened in cleveland in may 2012 and columbus in october 2012 and additional casinos in cincinnati and toledo, as well as the installation of vlts at existing horse race tracks near cleveland, one of which opened in april 2013 and the other in december 2013 and the relocation of a racetrack to austintown, ohio in 2014, has had and will continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations at all our properties and such impact may be material. we intend to be proactive in our efforts to mitigate the effects of such competition, which include expanding marketing initiatives and proactively managing our cost structures at our properties.
major bowling tournaments in the reno market the national bowling stadium, located one block from eldorado reno, is one of the largest bowling complexes in north america and has been selected to host multi-month tournaments in reno every year through 2018 except for 2017. it has also been selected to host ten united states bowling congress ("usbc") tournaments from 2019 through 2026. during this period, two of the ten usbc tournaments may be held in the same year. through a one-time agreement, the national bowling stadium hosted the usbc open tournament in reno in 2014; usually an off-year for reno. historically, these multi-month bowling tournaments have attracted a significant number of visitors to the reno market and have benefited business in the downtown area, including eldorado reno. the usbc tournaments brought approximately 73,000 bowlers to the reno area during the 2013 tournament period which began on march 1st and continued through july 7th. both tournaments
39
returned to reno in 2014 and brought approximately 62,000 bowlers to the reno area during the 2014 tournament period which began on february 28th and continued through july 12th.
west virginia smoking ban on august 26, 2014, the board of health of hancock county, west virginia adopted and approved the clean air regulation act of 2014 ("regulation"), which will be effective july 1, 2015. the regulation, as currently adopted, will ban smoking in public places in hancock county including at mountaineer. we are continuing to evaluate the regulation, its impact on our mountaineer facility, and steps to become compliant with the regulation upon its effective date. we expect that the regulation will have a negative impact on our business and results of operations at mountaineer, and such impact may be material.

the following table highlights the results of our operations (dollars in thousands):

net operating revenues                          $361,823                   $247,186           46.4   %

net operating revenues.    mtr gaming contributed $124.2 million of net operating revenues for the period from the merger date through december 31, 2014 consisting primarily of casino revenues. including the incremental mtr gaming revenues, net operating revenues increased 46.4% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year.
excluding incremental mtr gaming revenues of $124.2 million, consolidated net operating revenues decreased 3.9% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year as both eldorado reno and eldorado shreveport experienced declines in all components of operating revenues.
equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates.    income from our unconsolidated affiliate, the silver legacy joint venture and our former unconsolidated affiliate, tamarack, decreased $ 0.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. our equity in the income of the silver legacy joint venture for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 amounted to $2.0 million and $2.3 million, respectively. equity in the income of tamarack for the year ended december 31, 2014, prior to its disposition on september 1, 2014, amounted to $0.7 million compared to $1.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.
operating income and net (loss) income.    consolidated operating income and net (loss) income includes operating income and a net loss of $17.6 million and $14.3. million, respectively, attributable to mtr gaming for the period from the merger date through december 31, 2014.
for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year, operating income, excluding operating income attributable to mtr gaming, decreased $12.0 million primarily due to declines in departmental operating margins, increased general and administrative payroll and professional services associated with the merger, and a decline in equity income of unconsolidated affiliates. operating income was also impacted by an increase in acquisition charges of $3.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. net (loss) income decreased $24.1 million during the
40
year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year due to the same factors negatively impacting operating income, combined with the absence of a $12.0 million gain in 2013 for the extinguishment of debt of silver legacy and a tax provision of $1.1 million. this decrease during the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013 was partially offset by a $0.7 million gain resulting from the termination of silver legacy's supplemental executive retirement plan and a $0.2 million decrease in interest expense.

casino revenues.    mtr gaming contributed $113.6 million of casino revenues for the period from the merger date through december 31, 2014 consisting primarily of net win from slot operations, table games and poker. as a result, consolidated casino revenues increased 55.3% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year.
consolidated casino revenues, excluding mtr gaming revenues, decreased 4.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. the decrease in casino revenues at eldorado reno of 1.7% was primarily due to decreases in slot handle and table games credit drop. casino
41
revenues decreased 4.8% at eldorado shreveport for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year due to lower slot handle while the slot hold percentage remained constant. the decrease in casino revenues associated with the decline in slot volume was partially offset by an increase in table games revenues resulting from an increase in the table games hold percentage, which more than offset a decrease in table games drop for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. the results of operations of eldorado shreveport have also been negatively impacted by the addition of a new competitor in the shreveport/bossier city market in june of 2013 that reduced the market share of all of the other casino operators in the market for the year ended december 31, 2014, including eldorado shreveport.
pari-mutuel commissions.    mtr gaming contributed $2.0 million of pari-mutuel commissions for the period from the merger date through december 31, 2014.
food and beverage revenues.    mtr gaming contributed $9.1 million of food and beverage revenues for the period from the merger date through december 31, 2014. as a result, consolidated food and beverage revenues increased 12.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year.
consolidated food and beverage revenues, excluding mtr gaming revenues, decreased 2.4% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year due to declines in food and beverage revenues of 2.4% at both eldorado reno and eldorado shreveport. food revenues at eldorado reno remained flat for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. declines in customer counts of 2.5% were offset by an increase in the average check as a result of selective price increases in eldorado reno's restaurants. beverage revenues decreased primarily due to lower complimentary sales and the closure of the bubinga nightclub in may 2014. the decline in food and beverage revenues at eldorado shreveport for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the decrease in customer volume as evidenced by a 1.7% decline in customer counts.
hotel revenues.    mtr gaming contributed $1.4 million of hotel revenues for the period from the merger date through december 31, 2014 and consolidated hotel revenues increased 4.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year.
consolidated hotel revenues, excluding mtr gaming, decreased 1.1% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. hotel revenues at eldorado reno decreased 0.8% due to declines in hotel occupancy to 82.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 82.9% for the year ended december 31, 2013. these declines were partially offset by growth in hotel revenues associated with an increase in our resort fee from $6 to $8 in august of 2013 resulting in a higher adr which rose to $72.57 for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $72.17 during the prior year. hotel revenues at eldorado shreveport decreased 1.7% due to a decline in the adr to $64.50 during the year ended december 31, 2014 from $65.72 during 2013, which more than offset the slight increase in occupancy to 89.6% during 2014 from 89.4% during 2013.
other revenues.    other revenues are comprised of revenues generated by our retail outlets, entertainment venues and other miscellaneous items. mtr gaming contributed $4.0 million of other revenues for the period from the merger date through december 31, 2014. as a result, consolidated other revenues increased 27.1% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year.
consolidated other revenues, excluding mtr gaming, decreased 11.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. other revenues at eldorado reno decreased 12.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to declines in entertainment revenues associated with lower attendance at the eldorado reno theater, and to a lesser extent, decreased retail revenues. other revenues decreased 8.1% at eldorado shreveport for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year due to lower atm commission revenues and retail sales which were partially offset by improved spa revenues.
42
promotional allowances.    consolidated promotional allowances, expressed as a percentage of casino revenues, decreased to 16.2% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 22.4% for the prior year; however, the total consolidated promotional allowances incurred increased 12.5%. mtr gaming's promotional allowances represented 5.2% of its casino revenues for the period after the merger. promotional allowances at eldorado reno increased slightly for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year reflecting an increase in our casino direct mail program. promotional allowances decreased 2.5% at eldorado shreveport in association with the 4.8% decrease in casino revenues. management actively reviews the effectiveness of its promotions and direct mail programs to expand successful promotions while eliminating or reducing less profitable promotions. promotional activities reflect our efforts to maintain the eldorado's share of the gaming markets in which it operates in an effort to mitigate the impact of increasing competition.

net operating revenues.    net operating revenues decreased 3.0% for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of decreases in casino revenues and increases in promotional activities at both eldorado shreveport and eldorado reno. in addition, decreases in hotel and other revenues at eldorado shreveport were only partially offset by increases in food and beverage revenues at both facilities and in hotel and other revenues at eldorado reno. as more fully explained below, the decrease in casino revenues at eldorado reno resulted primarily from a decrease in the
45
table games hold percentage. the decrease in casino revenues at eldorado shreveport primarily reflects reductions in slot machine wagering in 2013 compared to the prior year.
operating expenses.    operating expenses decreased 2.3% for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of decreases in casino expenses reflecting the decline in the associated revenues at both eldorado shreveport and eldorado reno. also contributing to the decrease were reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization.

operating income and net income (loss).    during 2013, we experienced an increase in operating income of $6.7 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the $12.3 million improvement in our equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. operating margins decreased during 2013 as consolidated net operating revenues decreased approximately $2.4 million more than the decrease in consolidated operating expenses. also offsetting the improvement from our unconsolidated affiliates were $3.2 million of acquisition charges incurred during 2013 in connection with the merger. net income increased approximately $19.9 million during 2013 compared to the prior year due to the factors positively impacting operating income previously noted combined with the recognition in 2013 of $12.0 million of gain on the extinguishment of debt of the silver legacy as a result of its reorganization, the absence of an $0.8 million loss on property donation incurred in the 2012 period and a $0.4 million reduction in interest expense.

supplemental unaudited presentation of consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012
adjusted ebitda (defined below), a non gaap financial measure, has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry and we believe that this non gaap supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the company's ongoing operating results. adjusted ebitda represents (losses) earnings before interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, (loss) gain on the sale or disposal of property, loss on property donation, other regulatory gaming assessment costs, loss on asset impairment, project opening costs, acquisition/strategic transaction costs, loss (gain) on modification, early retirement or extinguishment of debt and equity in (income) loss of unconsolidated affiliate, to the extent that such items existed in the periods presented. adjusted ebitda is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap, is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. uses of cash flows that are not reflected in adjusted ebitda include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments and certain regulatory gaming assessments, which can be significant. as a result, adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. other companies that provide ebitda information may calculate ebitda differently than we do. the definition of adjusted ebitda may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements.

the following table summarizes our net revenues and adjusted ebitda for our operating segments for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, in addition to reconciling adjusted ebitda to net income (loss) in accordance with u.s. gaap (unaudited, in thousands):

information for mtr gaming group, inc. for periods prior to the merger are based on mtr gaming's annual reports on form 10-k for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 as filed with the sec.
(4)
the combined basis reflects operations of mtr gaming for periods prior to the merger combined with the operations of resorts. such presentation does not conform with u.s. gaap or the sec's rules for pro forma presentation; however, we have included the combined information because we believe it provides a meaningful comparison for the periods presented.
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been existing cash, cash flow from operations and proceeds from the issuance of debt securities.
we expect that our primary capital requirements going forward will relate to the operation and maintenance of our properties and servicing our outstanding indebtedness. in 2015, we plan to spend approximately $29.2 million, net of reimbursements from west virginia on qualified capital expenditures and approximately $79.0 million to pay interest on the resorts senior secured notes and mtr second lien notes. we expect that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements and service our outstanding indebtedness for the foreseeable future; however, we cannot provide assurance that operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so and we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance our outstanding debt prior to its maturity in 2019 on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.
at december 31, 2014, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $87.6 million, $60.7 million of which was held by mtr gaming and $27.0 million of which was held by resorts.

eri is a holding company and its only significant assets are ownership interests in its subsidiaries, mtr gaming and holdco. eri's ability to fund its obligations depends on the cash flow of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise make funds available to eri. the agreements governing the indebtedness of mtr gaming limit mtr gaming's ability to distribute or otherwise make funds available to eri or holdco and its subsidiaries, including resorts, and the agreements governing indebtedness of resorts limit resorts' ability to distribute or otherwise make funds available to eri or mtr gaming and its subsidiaries. the ability of mtr gaming and resorts to make funds available to eri and each other will also depend on, among other things, their earnings, business and tax considerations and applicable law, including regulations of gaming and racing authorities and state laws regulating the payment of dividends and distributions. such limitations could adversely impact the liquidity of eri, mtr gaming, holdco and their respective subsidiaries.
operating cash flow.    for the year ended december 31, 2014, we generated cash flows from operating activities of $33.9 million as compared to $23.6 million in the prior year. the increase in operating cash was primarily due to various changes in balance sheet accounts in conjunction with the merger along with changes in the balance sheet accounts in the normal course of business. these changes were offset by the decline in net income, including the absence of silver legacy's gain on the early retirement of its debt for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year.
investing cash flow.    net cash flows provided in investing activities totaled $38.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $7.6 million used for the year ended december 31, 2013. net cash flows provided in investing activities for 2014 primarily consisted of $53.1 million representing acquired cash, including restricted cash, associated with the merger. this increase was partially offset by $10.6 million in capital expenditures for various renovation projects and equipment purchases.
financing cash flow.    net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 totaled $14.2 million compared to $11.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2013. net repayments on our resorts secured credit facility (see below) amounted to $2.5 million compared to $5.0 million of debt payments during the year ended december 31, 2013. other financing activity expenditures included distributions to our members totaling $0.6 million compared to $6.1 million during the prior year. during the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase in restricted cash of $3.2 million due to a decrease in funds related to horsemen's fines and simulcasting funds that are restricted to payments for improving horsemen's facilities and racing purses at scioto downs was offset by a decrease in restricted cash related to the return of $2.5 million of the $5.0 million cash collateral that resorts previously provided as credit support for silver legacy's obligations under its credit agreement.
the repurchase of mtr gaming common stock totaled $5.0 million and represented the amount paid in cash by holdco upon closing of the merger. an additional $30.0 million of mtr gaming common stock was purchased by mtr gaming upon closing of the merger and was reflected as a reduction of the net cash acquired under investing activities. also during the year ended december 31, 2014, mtr gaming used $11.0 million to repurchase $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of mtr senior lien notes at a price of $110.25 per $100 in principal amount of the purchased notes.
capital expenditures during the year ended december 31, 2014, additions to property and equipment, primarily slot machines, and other capital projects aggregated $10.6 million, which included $3.5 million at eldorado reno, $3.3 million at eldorado shreveport and $3.8 million at the mtr gaming properties.

having a useful life of more than three years and placed into service after july 1, 2011. qualifying capital expenditures include the purchase of slot machines and related equipment to the extent such slot machines are retained by mountaineer at its west virginia location for not less than five years. any unexpended balance from a given fiscal year will be available for one additional fiscal year, after which time the remaining unused balance carried forward will be forfeited. for the period from the merger date to december 31, 2014, mountaineer was reimbursed $1.4 million on qualified capital expenditures. as of december 31, 2014, mountaineer remains eligible for approximately $5.8 million under annual modernization fund grants that expire in varying dates through june 30, 2016. we can make no assurances we will be able to make qualifying capital expenditures purchases sufficient to receive reimbursement of the available funds prior to their expiration.
we anticipate spending up to a total of approximately $32.7 million, or $29.2 after anticipated reimbursements from west virginia on qualified capital expenditures of $3.5 million, on capital expenditures during 2015. gross expenditures for 2015 are expected to include $12.1 million for facility improvements, information technology upgrades and related equipment; $7.7 million for development at scioto downs, including a new brew brothers branded restaurant and bar; $1.6 million for a hotel room remodel project at eldorado reno; $5.5 million for slot machines; $2.3 million on the racing related capital expenditures; and $3.5 million for other equipment and capital expenditures.
silver legacy joint venture loan under the plan of reorganization, each of eldorado limited liability company ("ellc") and galleon retained its 50% interest in the silver legacy, but was required to advance $7.5 million to the silver legacy pursuant to a subordinated loan and provide credit support by depositing $5.0 million of cash into bank accounts that are subject to a security interest in favor of the lender under the silver legacy credit agreement. the $7.5 million note receivable from ellc to the silver legacy was issued on november 16, 2012 with a stated interest rate of 5% per annum and a maturity date of may 16, 2018. payment of any interest or principal under the loan is subordinate to the senior indebtedness of the silver legacy. accrued interest under the loan will be added to the principal amount of the loan and may not be paid unless principal of the loan may be paid in compliance with the terms of the senior indebtedness outstanding or at maturity. in december 2014, silver legacy deposited $5.0 million of cash into a cash collateral account securing its obligations under its credit agreement, which reduced the credit support obligation of each of ellc and galleon to $2.5 million each and resulted in the return of $2.5 million of the $5.0 million of cash collateral that resorts previously provided as credit support for silver legacy's obligations under its credit agreement.
debt obligations resorts' debt obligations on june 1, 2011, resorts issued $180 million of 8.625% resorts senior secured notes due june 15, 2019 (the "resorts senior secured notes"). interest on the resorts senior secured notes is payable semiannually each june 15th and december 15th to holders of record on the preceding june 1st or december 1st, respectively.
the indenture relating to the resorts senior secured notes contains various restrictive covenants including, restricted payments and investments, additional liens, transactions with affiliates, covenants imposing limitations on additional debt, dispositions of property, mergers and similar transactions. as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the indenture relating to the resorts senior secured notes.
the resorts senior secured notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by all of resorts' current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries other than eldorado capital corp., an entity that was formed for the exclusive purpose of acting as co-issuer of debt issued by resorts
54
(collectively, the "guarantors"). the silver legacy joint venture is not a subsidiary and did not guarantee the resorts senior secured notes. the resorts senior secured notes are secured by a first priority security interest on substantially all of resorts' current and future assets (other than certain excluded assets, including gaming licenses and resorts' interest in the silver legacy joint venture). in addition, all of the membership interests in resorts and equity interests in the guarantors are subject to a pledge for the benefit of the holders of the resorts senior secured notes.
the company may redeem some or all of the resorts senior secured notes prior to june 15, 2015 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a "make whole premium" together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. on or after june 15, 2015, resorts may redeem the resorts senior secured notes at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon:

2015     104.313   %
2016     102.156   %
2017 and thereafter     100.000   %
on june 1, 2011, resorts entered into a $30 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "resorts secured credit facility") available until may 30, 2014 consisting of a $15 million term loan and a $15 million revolving credit facility. the term loan was repaid during the second quarter of 2014. at december 31, 2013, the outstanding principal amount under the term loan was $2.5 million. resorts did not renew the resorts secured credit facility when it matured on may 30, 2014.
mtr gaming's debt obligations mtr second lien notes.    on august 1, 2011, mtr gaming completed the offering of $565.0 in aggregate principal amount of senior secured second lien notes (the "mtr second lien notes") due august 1, 2019 at an issue price equal to 97% of the aggregate principal amount of the mtr second lien notes. the mtr second lien notes mature on august 1, 2019, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on february 1 and august 1 of each year.
the mtr second lien notes and the guarantees are senior secured obligations and are jointly and severally, fully, and unconditionally guaranteed by mtr gaming's current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, other than mtr gaming's immaterial subsidiaries. the mtr second lien notes are secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of the assets of mtr gaming and the guarantors, other than excluded property, as defined in the senior secured second lien indenture. the mtr second lien notes and the guarantees are effectively junior to any of mtr gaming's and the guarantors' existing and future debt that is secured by senior or prior liens on the collateral to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such obligations.
the indenture governing the mtr second lien notes contains a number of customary covenants, including limitations on restricted payments and investments, additional liens, transactions with affiliates, additional debt, dispositions of property, mergers and similar transactions, and events of default. in addition, if the consolidated total debt ratio of mtr gaming is equal to or greater than 4.0 to 1.0 and such offer is permitted pursuant to the terms of mtr gaming's credit facilities, mtr gaming is required to repay debt under its credit facility or make an offer to purchase mtr second lien notes with the excess cash flow amounts (as such term is defined in the indenture governing the mtr second lien notes). as of december 31, 2014, mtr gaming was in compliance with the covenants under the indenture relating to the mtr second lien notes.
mtr gaming may redeem some or all of the mtr second lien notes prior to august 1, 2015 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a "make whole premium" together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. on or after august 1, 2015, mtr gaming may redeem the
55
mtr second lien notes at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon:

2015      106.00   %
2016      103.00   %
2017 and thereafter      100.00   %
in october 2014, mtr gaming repurchased $10 million in aggregate principal amount of its 11.25% mtr second lien notes, at a price of $110.25 per $100 in principal amount of the purchased notes. the repurchase resulted in a $1.2 million annual savings in interest expense. after giving effect to the repurchase of the bonds in october 2014, the annual interest expense on the mtr second lien notes approximates $64.5 million. additionally, annual amortization of the premium on the mtr second lien notes is approximately $10.9 million.
credit facility.    on august 1, 2011, mtr gaming entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the "mtr credit facility") with a borrowing availability of $20.0 million and a maturity date of august 1, 2016. on december 5, 2014, mtr gaming terminated the mtr credit facility. there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at the time of its termination. mtr gaming terminated the credit facility because it determined that it had sufficient capital resources to meet its expected liquidity needs without incurring borrowings under the credit facility. mtr gaming did not incur any fees or penalties in connection with the termination of the credit facility.

includes an annual table gaming license fee of $2.5 million for mountaineer which is due on july 1st of each year as long as mountaineer operates table games. includes our obligation for gaming taxes at presque isle downs, which is set at a minimum of $10.0 million per year, as required by the pennsylvania gaming control board. also includes our obligation at presque isle downs, as the holder of a category 1 license, to create a fund to be used for the improvement and
56
maintenance of the backside area of the racetrack with an amount of not less than $250,000 or more than $1 million annually for a five-year period beginning in 2017.

in connection with the 2003 purchase of scioto downs, certain shareholders of scioto downs elected the option to receive cash and contingent earn-out payments ("cep rights") in lieu of all cash for their outstanding shares of scioto downs' common stock. the triggering event occurred when scioto downs received its permanent vlt license in may 2012 and commenced gaming operations. as a result, we recorded a liability for the estimated ten year payout to the stockholders who elected to receive the cep rights. the future obligation was calculated based on scioto downs' projected ebitda for the ten calendar years beginning january 1, 2013.
(6)
these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheets, which are included elsewhere in this report. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our regulatory gaming assessments.
the table above excludes certain commitments as of december 31, 2014, for which the timing of expenditures associated with such commitments is unknown, or contractual agreements have not been executed, or the guaranteed maximum price for such contractual agreements has not been agreed upon.
the repayment of our long-term debt, which consists of indebtedness evidenced by the resorts senior secured notes and the mtr second lien notes, is subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indentures governing these obligations.
we routinely enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of our business, including construction contracts for minor projects that are not material to our business or financial condition as a whole. our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts.
the company does not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues, results of operations or cash flows since inception.
other liquidity matters the pennsylvania gaming control board (the "pgcb"), the pennsylvania department of revenue and the pennsylvania state police (collectively "the borrowers"), were required to fund the costs they incurred in connection with the initial development of the infrastructure to support gaming operations in pennsylvania as well as the initial ongoing costs of the borrowers. the initial funding of these costs was provided from a loan from the pennsylvania general fund in the amount of approximately $36.1 million, and further funding was provided from additional loans from the pennsylvania property tax reserve fund in the aggregate amount of approximately $63.8 million.
57
the pennsylvania department of revenue will assess all licensees, including presque isle downs, their proportionate share of amounts represented by the borrowings, which are in the aggregate amount of $99.9 million, once the designated number of pennsylvania's slot machine licensees is operational. on july 11, 2011, the pgcb issued an administrative order which established that payments associated with the $63.8 million that was borrowed from the property tax reserve fund would commence on january 1, 2012. the repayment allocation between all current licensees is based upon equal weighting of (i) cumulative gross slot revenue since inception in relation to the combined cumulative gross slot revenue for all licensees and (ii) single year gross slot revenue (during the state's fiscal year ending june 30) in relation to the combined single year gross slot revenue for all licensees; and amounts paid each year will be adjusted annually based upon changes in the licensee's proportionate share of gross slot revenue. we have estimated that our total proportionate share of the aggregate $63.8 million to be assessed to the gaming facilities will be approximately $4.2 million and will be paid quarterly over a ten-year period, which began effective january 1, 2012. for the $36.1 million that was borrowed from the general fund, payment is scheduled to begin after all fourteen licensees are operational. although we cannot determine when payment will begin, we have considered a similar repayment model for the general fund borrowings and estimated that our total proportionate share of the aggregate $36.1 million to all fourteen gaming facilities will be approximately $2.2 million.
the recorded estimate is subject to revision based upon future changes in the revenue assumptions utilized to develop the estimate. our estimated total obligation at december 31, 2014 is $5.0 million. the company paid approximately $0.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2014.
we are faced with certain contingencies involving litigation and environmental remediation and compliance. these commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail in "part i, item 3. legal proceedings" and note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, both of which are included elsewhere in this report. in addition, new competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, and could have a similar adverse effect on our liquidity. see "part i, item 1a. risk factorsrisks related to our business" which is included elsewhere in this report.
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, which is included elsewhere in this report. these policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates.
business combinations the company applied the provisions of accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 805, "business combinations", in the accounting for the merger. it required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. goodwill as of the acquisition date was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. while we used our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates were inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed any subsequent adjustments will be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.
58
accounting for business combinations required our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, including our estimate of intangible assets, such as gaming licenses, trade names and customer loyalty programs. although we believe the assumptions and estimates made have been reasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain. for our gaming license valuation, our properties estimated future cash flows were the primary assumption in the respective intangible valuations. cash flow estimates included assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, net win per unit (revenue), patron visits and growth percentages. the growth percentages were developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data, operating margins, and current regulatory, social and economic climates. the most significant of the assumptions used in the valuations included: (1) revenue growth/decline percentages; (2) discount rates; (3) effective income tax rates; (4) future terminal values and (5) capital expenditure assumptions. these assumptions were developed for each of our properties based on historical trends in the current competitive markets in which they operate, and projections of future performance and competition. the primary assumptions with respect to our trade names and customer loyalty program intangibles primary assumptions were selecting the appropriate royalty rates and cost estimates for replacement cost analyses in addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. the company will reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance's or contingency's estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
accounting for unconsolidated affiliates the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. investments in unconsolidated affiliates which are 50% or less owned and do not meet the consolidation criteria of asc 810, "consolidation" are accounted for under the equity method. all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. certain amendments of asc 810 became effective for us beginning january 1, 2010. such amendments include changes to the quantitative approach to determine the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("vie"). an enterprise must determine if its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie by evaluating whether 1) the enterprise has the power to direct activities of the vie that have a significant effect on economic performance, and 2) the enterprise has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie. the amendments to asc 810 also require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie. the company believes the adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
the company considers whether the fair values of any of its equity method investments have declined below their carrying value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded values may not be recoverable. if the company considers any such decline to be other than temporary, then a write-down would be recorded to the estimated fair value. estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rate. there were no impairments of the company's equity method investments in 2014, 2013 or 2012.
59
revenue recognition gaming revenues consist of the net win from gaming activities, which is the difference between amounts wagered and amounts paid to winning patrons, and is recognized at the time wagers are made net of winning payouts to patrons. base and progressive jackpots are accrued and charged to revenue at the time the obligation to pay the jackpot is established. pari-mutuel commissions consist of commissions earned from thoroughbred and harness racing, and importing of simulcast signals from other race tracks. pari-mutuel commissions are recognized at the time wagers are made. such commissions are a designated portion of the wagering handle as determined by state racing commissions, and are shown net of the taxes assessed by state and local agencies, as well as purses and other contractual amounts paid to horsemen associations. we recognize revenues from fees earned through the exporting of simulcast signals to other race tracks at the time wagers are made. such fees are based upon a predetermined percentage of handle as contracted with the other race tracks. revenues from food and beverage are recognized at the time of sale and revenues from lodging are recognized on the date of stay. other revenues are recorded at the time services are rendered or merchandise sold. we offer certain promotional allowances to our customers, including complimentary lodging, food and beverage, and promotional credits for free play on slot machines. the retail value of these promotional items is shown as a reduction in total revenues on our consolidated statements of operations.
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file us federal income tax returns and various state and local income tax returns. the company does not have tax sharing agreements with the other members within the consolidated eri group. with few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to us federal or state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2011.
the company estimates an annual effective income tax rate based on projected results for the year and applies this rate to income before taxes to calculate income tax expense. any refinements made due to subsequent information that affects the estimated annual effective income tax rate are reflected as adjustments in the current period. the income tax provision results in an effective tax rate that has an unusual relationship to the company's pretax income (loss). this is due to the federal and state valuation allowances on the company's deferred tax assets as discussed below.
the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributed primarily to the federal and state valuation allowances on the company's deferred tax assets as discussed below. as a result of the company's net operating losses and net deferred tax asset position (after exclusion of certain deferred tax liabilities that generally cannot be offset against deferred tax assets, known as "naked credits"), the company expects to continue to provide for a full valuation allowance against substantially all of the net federal and the net state deferred tax assets.
for income tax purposes the company amortizes or depreciates certain assets that have been assigned an indefinite life for book purposes. the incremental amortization or depreciation deductions for income tax purposes result in an increase in certain deferred tax liabilities that cannot be used as a source of future taxable income for purposes of measuring the company's need for a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets. therefore, the company expects to record non-cash deferred tax expense as the company amortizes these assets for tax purposes.
prior to the merger date, holdco was taxed as a partnership under the internal revenue code pursuant to which income taxes were primarily the responsibility of the partners. eri is a c corporation subject to the federal and state corporate-level income taxes at prevailing corporate tax rates. while taxed as a partnership, holdco was not subject to federal income tax liability. because holders of membership interests in holdco were required to include their respective shares of holdco's taxable income (including that of resorts) in their individual income tax returns, distributions
60
were made to their respective member(s) to cover such tax liabilities. such distributions were subject to limitation in accordance with the provisions of their respective operating agreements. eldorado shreveport #2, llc has elected as a single member limited liability company to be taxed as a c corporation. current and deferred income taxes associated with eldorado shreveport #2, llc were not material.
under the applicable accounting standards, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the accounting standards also provide guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. we have recorded no liability associated with uncertain tax positions at december 31, 2014 and 2013.
property and equipment and other long-lived assets property and equipment is recorded at cost, except for mtr which was adjusted for fair value under asc 805, and is depreciated over its estimated useful life or lease term. judgments are made in determining estimated useful lives and salvage values of these assets. the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of assets. we review depreciation estimates and methods as new events occur, more experience is acquired, and additional information is obtained that would possibly change our current estimates.
property, equipment and other long-lived assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with asc 360property,  plant, and equipment. the company evaluates its long-lived assets periodically for impairment issues or, more frequently, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the net carrying value to the sum of the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets. the amount of impairment loss, if any, is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset which is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). for assets to be disposed of, impairment is recognized based on the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. based on the results of our periodic reviews we have not recorded any impairment losses during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
for undeveloped properties, including non-operating real properties, when indicators of impairment are present, properties are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset's carrying amount. the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons. the fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations, which are subject to the assumptions and factors as previously discussed, were generally based on a review of comparable activities in the marketplace, which falls within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business. intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are
61
reviewed for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired.
goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. the company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing income and market approaches. the income approach is based on projected future cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows. the market approach is based on the company's market capitalization at the testing date. the aggregate carrying value of the company's goodwill approximated $66.8 million as of december 31, 2014. the company did not have goodwill prior to the merger date.
other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. any excess of carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment within the consolidated statement of operations in the period of review. our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of racing and gaming licenses, trade names and customer loyalty programs.
the gaming and racing licenses of each property were valued in aggregate for each respective property, as these licenses are considered to be the most significant asset of the properties and the gaming licenses could not be obtained without holding the racing licenses. therefore, market participant would consider the licenses in aggregate. the fair value of the licenses is calculated using an excess earnings methodology, which is an income approach methodology that allocates the projected cash flows of the property to the gaming license intangible assets less charges for the use of the other identifiable assets of the property, including working capital, fixed assets, and other intangible assets. we believe this methodology is appropriate as the gaming licenses are the primary asset to the properties, the licenses are linked to each respective facility and it's the lowest level at which discrete cash flows can be directly attributable to the assets. under the gaming legislation applicable to our properties, licenses are property specific and can only be acquired if a buyer acquires the existing facility. because existing licenses may not be acquired and transferred for use at a different facility, the estimated future cash flows of each of our properties was the primary assumption in the valuation of such property. the aggregate carrying value of the company's gaming license intangibles approximated $482.0 million as of december 31, 2014.
assessing the indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed quantitative and qualitative business-specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments. our properties' estimated future cash flows are a primary assumption in the respective impairment analyses. unforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge, which could be material. cash flow estimates include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, net win per unit (revenue), patron visits, growth percentages which are developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data, operating margins, and current regulatory, social and economic climates. these estimates could also be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state, or local regulations, economic downturns or developments and other market conditions affecting travel and access to the properties. the most significant of the assumptions used in our valuations include: (1) revenue growth/decline percentages; (2) discount rates; (3) effective income tax rates; (4) future terminal values and (5) capital expenditure assumptions. these assumptions were developed for each property based on historical trends, the current competitive markets in which they operate, and projections of future performance and competition.
the company values trade names using the relief-from-royalty method. royalty rates range from 0.5% - 1.0%. the customer loyalty program was valued using a combination of a replacement cost and
62
lost profits analysis. trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over a 3.5 year useful life and the customer loyalty program is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a one year useful life. the aggregate carrying value of trade names and customer loyalty program intangibles as of december 31, 2014 was approximately $6.7 million and $4.8 million, respectively.
we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our other indefinite-lived intangible assets; however, these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our licensing intangibles below the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet, we may be required to conduct an interim test or possibly recognize impairment charges, which may be material, in future periods.
no impairment charges were recorded for our other indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of the years presented.
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we reserve an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected. methodologies for estimating bad debt reserves range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables. historical collection rates are considered, as are customer relationships, in determining specific reserves. as with many estimates, management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for bad debts.
self-insurance reserves eldorado reno and eldorado shreveport are self-insured for their group health programs and eldorado reno is self-insured for its workmen's compensation program. we utilize historical claims information provided by our third party administrators to make estimates for known pending claims as well as claims that have been incurred, but not reported as of the balance sheet date. in order to mitigate our potential exposure, we have an individual claim stop loss policy on our group health claims and a specific claim stop loss policy on our workmen's compensation claims. if we become aware of significant claims or material changes affecting our estimates, we would increase our reserves in the period in which we made such a determination and record the additional expense. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, $1.3 million was accrued for insurance and workmen's compensation medical claims reserves and is included in accrued and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
frequent players program we offer programs whereby our participating patrons can accumulate points for wagering that can be redeemed for credits for free play on slot machines, lodging, food and beverage, merchandise and in limited situations, cash. based upon the estimated redemptions of frequent player program points, an estimated liability is established for the cost of redemption on earned but unredeemed points. the estimated cost of redemption utilizes estimates and assumptions of the mix of the various product offerings for which the points will be redeemed and costs of such product offerings. changes in the programs, membership levels and redemption patterns of our participating patrons can impact this liability. the aggregate outstanding liability for the frequent players program was $2.4 million and $2.0 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and is included as a component of other accrued liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
litigation, claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation, claims and assessments. these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events, as well as assumptions about future events. if our assessment of such a matter should change, we may have to change the estimates, which
63
may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. actual results could differ from these estimates.
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (the "fasb") issued accounting standards update no. 2014-9,  revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) ("asu 2014-09"). the standard requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods and services. qualitative and quantitative disclosures are also required regarding customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. asu 2014-09 supersedes and replaces nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap. this accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2016. early adoption is not permitted. the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
in august 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-15, "presentation of financial statementsgoing concern" (subtopic 205-40) which amends the current guidance in asc topic 205 by adding subtopic 40. subtopic 40 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that in aggregate would raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. if substantial doubt existed, management would be required to make certain disclosures related to nature of the substantial doubt and under certain circumstances, how that substantial doubt would be mitigated. this amendment is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2016 and for subsequent interim and annual periods thereafter. early adoption is permitted. the company is currently evaluating the effects, if any, adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
in january 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-1, "income statementextraordinary and unusual items" (subtopic 225-20) which eliminates the concept of accounting of extraordinary items, previously defined as items that are both unusual and infrequent, which were reported as a separate item on the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. the elimination of this concept is intended to simplify accounting for unusual items and more closely align with international accounting practices. this amendment is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2015 and for subsequent interim and annual periods thereafter. early adoption is permitted. the company believes that the effects, if any, of the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

                                                  generation, whose integrated business consists of the generation, physical delivery and marketing of power across multiple geographical regions through its customer-facing business, constellation, which sells electricity and natural gas to both wholesale and retail customers. generation also sells renewable energy and other energy-related products and services, and engages in natural gas and oil exploration and production activities (upstream).

                         as a result of the constellation merger, generation owns a 50.01% interest in ceng. during 2014, generation assumed the operating licenses and corresponding operational control of cengs nuclear fleet. as a result, exelon and generation fully consolidated cengs financial position and results of operations into their businesses beginning on april 1, 2014.

   comed, whose business consists of the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of electricity transmission and distribution services to retail customers in northern illinois, including the city of chicago.

(a)   on april 1, 2014, generation assumed operational control of cengs nuclear fleet. as a result, the 2014 financial results include cengs results of operations on a fully consolidated basis from april 1, 2014 through december 31, 2014.

(b)                                              the registrants evaluate operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense. the registrants believe that revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense is a useful measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense is not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies presentations or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report.

exelons net income attributable to common shareholders was $1,623 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to $1,719 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, and diluted earnings per average common share were $1.88 for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to $2.00 for the year ended december 31, 2013.
86
operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense, which is a non-gaap measure discussed below, increased by $262 million as compared to 2013. the year-over-year increase reflects the inclusion of cengs results beginning april 1, 2014 and was primarily due to the following favorable factors:
                                                        increase of $815 million at generation primarily due to the inclusion of cengs results beginning april 1, 2014 through december 31, 2014, a decrease in fuel costs related to the cancellation of doe spent nuclear fuel disposal fees, increased capacity prices related to the reliability pricing model (rpm) for the pjm interconnection, llc (pjm) market, and favorable portfolio management activities in the new england and south regions; partially offset by higher procurement costs for replacement power related to the extreme cold weather in the first quarter of 2014 and lower realized energy prices related to executing generations ratable hedging strategy;

   increase of $365 million at generation related to the reduction in amortization of in-the-money energy contracts recorded at fair value at the constellation merger date and an increase related to the amortization of out-of-the money energy contracts recorded at fair value upon the consolidation of ceng;

    increase of $30 million at comed primarily reflecting higher transmission revenue due to increased capital investment and an increase of $93 million as a result of increased cost recovery associated with energy efficiency programs and uncollectible accounts expense (both offset below in operating and maintenance expense);

   increase of $33 million at peco primarily due to increased recovery from regulatory programs (offset below primarily in operating and maintenance expense); and

                                             increase of $104 million at bge primarily due to increased distribution revenue as a result of the 2013 and 2014 electric and natural gas distribution rate case orders issued by the maryland psc, increased cost recovery for energy efficiency and demand response programs (offset below in depreciation and amortization expense), and increased transmission revenue pursuant to increased rates effective june
2014.

the year-over-year increase in operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense was partially offset by the following unfavorable factors:
   decrease of $1,095 million at generation due to mark-to-market losses of $591 million in 2014 from economic hedging activities compared to $504 million in mark-to-market gains in 2013.

   decrease of $16 million at comed due to unfavorable weather in the comed service territory.

operating and maintenance expense increased by $1,298 million as compared to 2013 primarily due to the following unfavorable factors:
                                                     increase in generations labor, contracting and materials costs of $361 million primarily due to the inclusion of cengs results from april 1,
2014 through december 31, 2014, an increase of $44 million resulting from expenses recorded for a constellation merger commitment, an increase of $54 million as a result of an increase in the number of planned nuclear refueling outage days at generation, primarily related to the inclusion of cengs plants beginning april 1, 2014, and an increase of $16 million in the reserve for future asbestos-related bodily injury claims;

   increase in labor, contracting and materials costs of $56 million at comed associated with eima smart meter projects and $22 million at bge due to increased maintenance activities;

   increase in generations accretion expense of $78 million primarily due to the inclusion of cengs results from april 1, 2014 through december 31, 2014;

87
   long-lived asset impairments at generation of $663 million in 2014 compared to $157 million in 2013.

   increased storm costs at peco and bge of $100 million and $21 million, respectively;

   increased spending on energy and efficiency programs and increased uncollectible accounts expense at comed of $93 million; and

   increased uncollectible accounts expense at bge of $17 million.

the year-over-year increase in operating and maintenance expense was partially offset by the following favorable factor:
                                        a reduction in pension and non-pension postretirement benefits expense of $178 million primarily at exelon, generation, and comed, resulting from plan design changes for certain opeb plans and the favorable impact of higher actuarially assumed pension and opeb discount rates for 2014, partially offset by the inclusion of cengs pension and non-pension postretirement benefits expense from april 1, 2014 through december 31, 2014.

depreciation and amortization expense increased by $161 million primarily as a result of the inclusion of cengs results from april 1, 2014 through december 31, 2014, increased depreciation expense across the operating companies for ongoing capital expenditures, and higher regulatory asset amortization related to energy efficiency and demand response expenditures.
exelon recorded $437 million at generation as a result of gains recorded on the sales of ownership interest in certain generating stations in 2014.
exelon recorded a $261 million gain upon consolidation of ceng resulting from the difference in fair value of cengs net assets as of april 1, 2014, and the equity method investment previously recorded on generations and exelons books and the settlement of pre-existing transactions between generation and ceng. additionally, exelon recorded a $28 million bargain-purchase gain related to the integrys acquisition.
interest expense decreased by $291 million primarily as a result of a decrease in 2014 given comeds 2013 remeasurement of exelons like-kind exchange tax positions, offset at exelon by an increase in 2014 related to financing activities associated with the pending phi merger.
other, net increased by $5 million primarily at generation as a result of favorable settlements in 2014 of certain income tax positions on constellations pre-acquisition 2009-2012 tax returns and the change in realized and unrealized gains and losses on ndt funds.
exelons effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 were 26.8% and 37.6%, respectively. see note 14income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the components of the effective income tax rates.

adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings exelons adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings for the year ended december 31, 2014 were $2,068 million, or $2.39 per diluted share, compared with adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings of $2,149 million, or $2.50 per diluted share, for the same period in 2013. in addition to net income,

exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items. this information is intended to enhance an investors overall understanding of year-to-year operating results and provide an indication of exelons baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. in addition, this information is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting of future periods. adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings is not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies presentations or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report.
the following table provides a reconciliation between net income attributable to common shareholders as determined in accordance with gaap and adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 2013:

as of december 31, 2014, exelon projects incurring total additional phi acquisition and integration related expenses of $650 million, of which approximately $100 million is expected to be capitalized to property, plant and equipment excluding the direct investment exelon and phi have proposed to the phi utilities respective customers.
pursuant to the conditions set forth by the mdpsc in its approval of the merger transaction, exelon committed to provide a package of benefits to bge customers, and make certain investments in the city of baltimore and the state of maryland, resulting in an estimated direct investment in the state of maryland of approximately $1 billion. the direct investment estimate includes $95 million to $120 million for the requirement to cause construction of a headquarters building in baltimore for generations competitive energy businesses. on march 20, 2013, generation signed a twenty-year lease agreement that was contingent upon the developer obtaining all required approvals, permits and
91
financing for the construction of a building in baltimore, maryland. the operating lease became effective during the second quarter of 2014 when these outstanding contingencies were met by the developer. the building is expected to be ready for occupancy in approximately 2 years. see note 22commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to the lease commitments.
exelons strategy and outlook for 2015 and beyond exelons value proposition and competitive advantage come from its scope and scale across the energy value chain and its core strengths of operational excellence and financial discipline. exelons strategy is to leverage its integrated business model to create value and diversify its business. exelons competitive and regulated businesses feature a mix of attributes that, when combined, offer shareholders and customers a unique value proposition:
   generations competitive businesses provide commodity exposure and a platform to diversify into adjacent markets, while providing residual dividend support.

   exelons utilities provide a foundation for stable earnings and dividend support, which translates to a stable currency in our stock.

exelon believes its strategy provides a platform for optimal success in an energy industry experiencing fundamental and sweeping change. while enhancing exelons core value, it enables it to take advantage of a myriad of opportunities, rather than focusing on any one segment of the energy industry value chain.
generations competitive businesses create value for customers by providing innovative solutions and reliable, clean and affordable energy. generations electricity generation strategy is to pursue opportunities that provide generation to load matching and that diversify the generation fleet by expanding generations regional and technological footprint. generation leverages its energy generation portfolio to ensure delivery of energy to both wholesale and retail customers under long-term and short-term contracts, and in wholesale power markets. generations customer-facing activities foster development and delivery of other innovative energy-related products and services for its customers. generation operates in well-developed energy markets and employs an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. its generation fleet, including its nuclear plants which consistently operate at high capacity factors, also provide geographic and supply source diversity. these factors help generation mitigate the current challenging conditions in competitive energy markets.
exelons utility strategy is to improve reliability and operations and enhance the customer experience, while ensuring ratemaking mechanisms provide the utilities fair financial returns. the exelon utilities only invest in rate base where it provides a net benefit to customers and the community by increasing reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer needs. the exelon utilities make these investments prudently and at the lowest reasonable cost to customers. exelon seeks to leverage its scale and expertise across the utilities platform through enhanced standardization and sharing of best practices to achieve improved operational and financial results. combined, the utilities plan to invest approximately $16 billion over the next five years in smart meter technology, transmission projects, gas infrastructure, and electric system improvement projects, providing greater reliability and improved service for our customers and a stable return for the company.
exelons financial priorities are to maintain investment grade credit metrics at each of exelon, generation, comed, peco and bge, and to return value to exelons shareholders with a sustainable dividend throughout the energy commodity market cycle and through earnings growth from attractive investment opportunities.
92
various market, financial, and other factors could affect the registrants success in pursuing their strategies. exelon continues to assess infrastructure, operational, commercial, policy, and legal solutions to these issues. see item 1a. risk factors for additional information regarding market and financial factors.
proposed merger with pepco holdings, inc. (exelon)
on april 29, 2014, exelon and pepco holdings, inc. (phi) signed an agreement and plan of merger (as subsequently amended and restated as of july 18, 2014, the merger agreement) to combine the two companies in an all cash transaction. the resulting company will retain the exelon name and be headquartered in chicago. under the merger agreement, phis shareholders will receive $27.25 of cash in exchange for each share of phi common stock. exelon intends to fund the all-cash transaction using a combination of approximately $3.5 billion of debt, up to $1 billion cash from asset sales primarily at generation, and the remainder through issuance of equity (including mandatory convertible securities). in addition, exelon entered into a 364-day $7.2 billion senior unsecured bridge credit facility to support the contemplated transaction and provide flexibility for timing of permanent financing, which has subsequently been reduced to $3.2 billion as a result of execution of the debt and equity security issuances and the net after-tax cash proceeds from generating asset divestitures during the second half of 2014. see note 4mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, note 13debt and credit agreements, and note 19common stock of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to these transactions. in connection with the merger agreement, exelon entered into a subscription agreement under which it has purchased $126 million of a new class of nonvoting, nonconvertible and nontransferable preferred securities in phi as of december 31, 2014, with additional investments of $18 million to be made quarterly up to a maximum aggregate investment of $180 million. as part of the applications for approval of the merger, exelon and phi proposed a package of benefits to the phi utilities respective customers, providing for direct investment of more than $100 million with the actual amount and timing of any related payments dependent upon settlement discussions in merger regulatory approval proceedings and the terms of regulatory orders approving the merger.
to date, the phi stockholders, the virginia state corporation commission, the new jersey board of public utilities (njbpu) and the ferc have approved the merger of phi and exelon. the federal communications commission has also approved the transfer of certain phi communications licenses. on february 11, 2015, the njbpu approved the proposed merger and the previously filed settlement signed and filed by exelon, phi, atlantic city electric (ace), njbpu staff, and the independent energy coalition. the settlement provides a package of benefits to ace customers and the state of new jersey. this package of benefits includes the establishment of customer rate credit programs, with an aggregate value of $62 million for ace customers and energy efficiency programs that will provide savings for ace customers of $15 million.
completion of the transaction also remains conditioned upon approval by the public services commissions of the district of columbia, delaware and maryland. procedural schedules have been set in these commission proceedings and final approval decisions are expected in the first half of 2015.
on october 9, 2014, phi and exelon each received a request for additional information from the doj. the request had the effect of extending the doj review period until 30 days after phi and exelon each has certified that it has substantially complied with the request. on november 21, 2014, exelon and phi each certified that it had substantially complied with the request. accordingly, the hsr act waiting period expired on december 22, 2014, and the hsr act no longer precludes completion of the merger. although the doj allowed the waiting period under the hsr act to expire without taking any action with respect to the merger, the doj has not advised exelon or phi that it has concluded its investigation. exelon and phi will continue to work cooperatively with the doj regarding the proposed merger.
93
exelon and phi continue to expect to complete the merger in the second or third quarter of 2015.
through december 31, 2014, exelon has incurred approximately $179 million of expense associated with the proposed merger, including $48 million related to acquisition and integration costs and $131 million of costs incurred to finance the transaction. the merger agreement also provides for termination rights for both parties. under certain circumstances, if the merger agreement is terminated, phi may be required to pay exelon a termination fee ranging from $259 million to $293 million plus certain expenses. if the transaction does not close due to a regulatory failure, exelon may be required to pay phi a termination fee equal to the amount of purchased nonvoting preferred securities of phi described above, as a result of phi redeeming the outstanding nonvoting preferred securities for no consideration other than the nominal par value of the stock.
exelon has listed various potential risks relating to the pending merger with phi (see item 1a. risk factors), including difficulties that may be encountered in satisfying the conditions to completion of the merger and the potential for developments that might have an adverse effect on exelon and the ability to realize the expected benefits of the merger. exelon is taking steps to manage these risks and expects that the merger can be completed on a basis favorable to the companys shareholders and customers. accordingly, exelon anticipates closing the transaction in the second or third quarter of 2015. refer to note 4mergers, acquisitions, and dispositions of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the merger transaction.
power markets price of fuels. the use of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits is increasing natural gas supply and reserves, which places downward pressure on natural gas prices and, therefore, on wholesale and retail power prices, which results in a reduction in exelons revenues. forward natural gas prices have declined significantly over the last several years; in part reflecting an increase in supply due to strong natural gas production (due to shale gas development).
capacity market changes in pjm. in the wake of the january 2014 polar vortex that blanketed much of the eastern and midwestern united states, it became clear that while a major outage event was narrowly avoided, resources in pjm were not providing the level of reliability expected by customers. to address this disconnect, on december 12, 2014, pjm filed at ferc a proposal to make significant changes to its current capacity market construct, the reliability pricing model (rpm). pjms proposed changes generally seek to improve resource performance and reliability largely by limiting the excuses for non-performance and by increasing the penalties for performance failures. to cover capital and other costs and risks that suppliers would incur to meet these higher reliability standards, suppliers would be allowed to include adders for such costs as well as risk premiums in their capacity market offers. while offers are expected to put upward pressure on capacity clearing prices, operational improvements made as a result of pjms proposal are expected to improve reliability, to reduce energy production costs as a result of more efficient operations and to reduce the need for out of market energy payments to suppliers. exelon participated actively in pjms stakeholder process through which pjm developed the proposal and is also actively participating in the ferc proceeding including filing comments. pjm asked for a ferc order approving the proposal by april 1, 2015 so pjm can implement the proposal prior to its next capacity auction in may 2015. however, it is not clear when or how the ferc will respond to pjms proposal or, if it responds within pjms timeframe, whether ferc will require changes.
subsidized generation. the rate of expansion of subsidized generation, including low-carbon generation such as wind and solar energy, in the markets in which generations output is sold can negatively impact wholesale power prices, and in turn, generations results of operations.
94
various states have attempted to implement or propose legislation, regulations or other policies to subsidize new generation development which may result in artificially depressed wholesale energy and capacity prices. for example, the new jersey legislature enacted in to law in january 2011, the long term capacity pilot program act (lcapp). lcapp provides eligible generators with 15-year fixed contracts for the sale of capacity in the pjm capacity market. under lcapp, the local utilities in new jersey are required to pay (or receive) the difference between the price eligible generators receive in the capacity market and the price guaranteed under the 15-year contract. new jersey ultimately selected three proposals to participate in lcapp and build new generation in the state. in addition, on april 12, 2012, the mdpsc issued an order directing the maryland electric utilities to enter into a 20-year contract for differences (cfd) with cpv maryland, llc (cpv), under which cpv will construct an approximately 700 mw combined cycle gas turbine in waldorf, maryland, that it projected will be in commercial operation by june 1, 2015. cpv has subsequently sought to extend that date. the cfd mandated that utilities (including bge) pay (or receive) the difference between cpvs contract price and the revenues it receives for capacity and energy from clearing the unit in the pjm capacity market.
exelon and others have challenged the constitutionality and other aspects of the new jersey legislation and the actions taken by the mdpcs in state and federal courts. ultimately, the exelon parties prevailed in obtaining orders from the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit and the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit effectively undoing the actions taken by the new jersey legislature and the mdpsc respectively. the matter has been appealed to the u.s. supreme court, and while the court of appeals decisions are helpful, there remains risk the supreme court will overrule the lower courts.
as required under their contracts, generator developers who were selected in the new jersey and maryland programs (including cpv) offered and cleared in pjms capacity market auctions held in may 2012, 2013, and 2014. in addition, cpv has announced its intention to move forward with construction of its new jersey and maryland plants, with or without the challenged state subsidy. nonetheless to the extent that the state-required customer subsidies are included under their respective contracts, exelon believes that these projects may have artificially suppressed capacity prices in pjm in these auctions and may continue to do so in future auctions to the detriment of exelons market driven position. while the court decisions in new jersey and maryland are positive developments, continuation of these state efforts, if successful and unabated by an effective minimum offer price rule (mopr) for future capacity auctions, could continue to result in artificially depressed wholesale capacity and/or energy prices. other states could seek to establish programs, which could substantially impact exelons market driven position and could have a significant effect on exelons financial results of operations, financial position and cash flows. exelon continues to monitor developments and participate in stakeholder and other processes to ensure that similar state subsidies are not developed. in addition, exelon remains active in advocating for competitive markets, while opposing policies that require taxpayers and/ or consumers to subsidize or give preferential treatment to specific generation providers or technologies, or that would threaten the reliability and value of the integrated electricity grid.
see note 3regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the maryland order.
energy demand. modest economic growth partially offset by energy efficiency initiatives is resulting in positive growth for electricity for comed and peco, and no projected growth for electricity for bge. comed, peco and bge are projecting load volumes to increase by 0.4%, 0.8% and (0.2)%, respectively, in 2015 compared 2014.
retail competition. generations retail operations compete for customers in a competitive environment, which affect the margins that generation can earn and the volumes that it is able to
95
serve. the market experienced high price volatility in the first quarter of 2014 which contributed to bankruptcies and consolidations within the industry during the year. however, forward natural gas and power prices are expected to remain low and thus we expect retail competitors to stay aggressive in their pursuit of market share, and that wholesale generators (including generation) will continue to use their retail operations to hedge generation output.
strategic policy alignment exelon routinely reviews its hedging policy, dividend policy, operating and capital costs, capital spending plans, strength of its balance sheet and credit metrics, and sufficiency of its liquidity position, by performing various stress tests with differing variables, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging practices, and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades.
exelons board of directors declared the second quarter 2014 dividend of $0.31 per share on exelons common stock. the second quarter dividend was paid on june 10, 2014 to shareholders of record on may 16, 2014. all future quarterly dividends require approval by exelons board of directors.
exelons board of directors declared the third quarter 2014 dividend of $0.31 per share on exelons common stock. the third quarter dividend was paid on september 10, 2014 to shareholders of record on august 15, 2014.
exelons board of directors declared the fourth quarter 2014 dividend of $0.31 per share on exelons common stock. the fourth quarter dividend was paid on december 10, 2014 to shareholders of record on november 14, 2014.
exelons board of directors declared the first quarter 2015 dividend of $0.31 per share on exelons common stock. the first quarter dividend will be paid on march 10, 2015, to shareholders of record on february 13, 2015.
exelon and generation evaluate the economic viability of each of their generating units on an ongoing basis. decisions regarding the future of economically challenged generating assets will be based primarily on the economics of continued operation of the individual plants. if exelon and generation do not see a path to sustainable profitability in any of their plants, exelon and generation will take steps to retire those plants to avoid sustained losses. retirement of plants could materially affect exelons and generations results of operations, financial position, and cash flows through, among other things, potential impairment charges, accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expenses over the plants remaining useful lives, and ongoing reductions to operating revenues, operating and maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures.
hedging strategy exelons policy to hedge commodity risk on a ratable basis over three-year periods is intended to reduce the financial impact of market price volatility. generation is exposed to commodity price risk associated with the unhedged portion of its electricity portfolio. generation enters into non-derivative and derivative contracts, including financially-settled swaps, futures contracts and swap options, and physical options and physical forward contracts, all with credit-approved counterparties, to hedge this anticipated exposure. generation has hedges in place that significantly mitigate this risk for 2014 and 2015. this strategy has not changed as a result of recent and pending asset divestitures. however, generation is exposed to relatively greater commodity price risk in the subsequent years with respect to which a larger portion of its electricity portfolio is currently unhedged. as of december 31, 2014, the percentage of
96
expected generation hedged for the major reportable segments was 93%-96%, 61%-64% and 31%-34% for 2015, 2016, and 2017 respectively. the percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation (which reflects the divestiture impact of quail run). expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted for capacity based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following products, and options. equivalent sales represent all hedging products, such as wholesale and retail sales of power, options and swaps. generation has been and will continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate commodity price risk in subsequent years as well. see note 4mergers, acquisition and dispositions for more detail regarding the divestitures.
generation procures oil and natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts and spot-market purchases. nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services and contracted fuel fabrication services. the supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services, coal, oil and natural gas are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. supply market conditions may make generations procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at the contracted prices. approximately 50% of generations uranium concentrate requirements from 2015 through 2019 are supplied by three producers. in the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, generation believes that replacement uranium concentrates can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. non-performance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on exelons and generations results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
comed, peco and bge mitigate commodity price risk through regulatory mechanisms that allow them to recover procurement costs from retail customers.
growth opportunities with an emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship, exelon is currently pursuing growth in both the utility and competitive energy businesses. identifying and capitalizing on emerging trends and technologies, exelon plans to invest in new innovative technologies to compete with a new breed of energy players, leverage new technologies to create new or expand existing businesses, and improve productivity and efficiencies within our existing businesses. management continually evaluates growth opportunities aligned with exelons businesses, assets and markets, leveraging exelons expertise in those areas.
competitive energy businesses generation continues to pursue growth in its existing businesses and markets and further diversification across the competitive energy value chain.
   leveraging its competencies,

   generations 2014 acquisition of integrys allows generation to expand its retail footprint further in an industry sector that continues to mature and consolidate and provides hedging and diversification benefits to its existing portfolio.

   generation continues to pursue investment opportunities in renewables, in its nuclear uprate program and in the development of natural gas generation plants that is supported by the trend of increasing natural gas supply.

97
   investing in business diversification to position the company for the future,

   generation has launched a business in competitive distributed generation that capitalizes on the push toward a decentralized system.

   generation is also making investments across the natural gas value chain throughout north america, focusing initially on expansion of the existing upstream and wholesale gas businesses, as well as entry into liquefied natural gas.

regulated energy businesses the proposed acquisition of phi provides an opportunity to accelerate exelons regulated growth and provide stable cash flows, earnings accretion, and dividend stability. additionally, comed, peco and bge anticipate making significant future investments in infrastructure modernization, including smart meter and smart grid initiatives, storm hardening, and advanced reliability technologies. upon obtaining various approvals, comed also plans to invest approximately $280 million to construct the grand prairie gateway transmission line in illinois alleviating identified congestion and enhancing reliability. comed, peco and bge invest in rate base where it provides a net benefit to customers and the community by increasing reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer needs. these investments are made prudently and at the lowest reasonable cost to customers.
see note 3regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the smart meter and smart grid initiatives.
liquidity each of the registrants annually evaluates its financing plan, dividend practices and credit line sizing, focusing on maintaining its investment grade ratings while meeting its cash needs to fund capital requirements, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and opeb obligations and invest in new and existing ventures. a broad spectrum of financing alternatives beyond the core financing options can be used to meet its needs and fund growth including monetizing assets in the portfolio via project financing, asset sales, and the use of other financing structures (e.g., joint ventures, minority partners, etc.). the registrants expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs and capital expenditure requirements.
exelon, generation, comed, peco and bge have unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $0.5 billion, $5.3 billion, $1.0 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. generation also has bilateral credit facilities with aggregate maximum availability of $0.5 billion. see liquidity and capital resourcescredit mattersexelon credit facilities below.
exposure to worldwide financial markets. exelon has exposure to worldwide financial markets including european banks. disruptions in the european markets could reduce or restrict the registrants ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. as of december 31, 2014, approximately 29%, or $2.5 billion, of the registrants aggregate total commitments were with european banks, excluding the unsecured bridge facility to provide financing for the proposed phi acquisition. the credit facilities include $8.5 billion in aggregate total commitments of which $7.3 billion was available as of december 31, 2014, due to outstanding letters of credit. there were no borrowings under the registrants credit facilities as of december 31, 2014. see note 13debt and credit agreements of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the credit facilities.
98
tax matters see note 14income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
environmental legislative and regulatory developments.
exelon supports the promulgation of certain environmental regulations by the u.s. epa, including air, water and waste controls for electric generating units. see discussion below for further details. the air and waste regulations will have a disproportionate adverse impact on fossil-fuel power plants, requiring significant expenditures of capital and variable operating and maintenance expense, and will likely result in the retirement of older, marginal facilities. due to their low emission generation portfolios, generation and ceng will not be significantly directly affected by these regulations, representing a competitive advantage relative to electric generators that are more reliant on fossil-fuel plants. various bills have been introduced in the u.s. congress that would prohibit or impede the u.s. epas rulemaking efforts. the timing of the consideration of such legislation is unknown.
air quality. in recent years, the u.s. epa has been implementing a series of increasingly stringent regulations under the clean air act relating to naaqs for conventional air pollutants (e.g., nox, so2 and particulate matter) as well as stricter technology requirements to control haps (e.g., acid gases, mercury and other heavy metals) from electric generation units. the u.s. epa continues to review and update its naaqs with a tightened particulate matter naaqs issued in december 2012 and a tightened ozone naaqs, to be finalized in late 2015, proposed for public comment in december 2014. these recently finalized or proposed updates will potentially result in more stringent emissions limits on fossil-fuel electric generating stations. there continues to be opposition among fossil-fuel generation owners to the potential stringency and timing of these air regulations.
in july 2011, the u.s. epa published csapr and in june 2012, it issued final technical corrections. csapr requires 28 upwind states in the eastern half of the united states to significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution in downwind states. on august 21, 2012, a three-judge panel of the d.c. circuit court held that the u.s. epa had exceeded its authority in certain material aspects with respect to csapr and vacated the rule and remanded it to the u.s. epa for further rulemaking consistent with its decision. the court also ordered that cair remain in effect pending finalization of csapr on remand. numerous entities challenged the csapr in the d.c. circuit court. on august 21, 2012, the d.c. circuit court of appeals held that the u.s. epa has exceeded its authority in certain material aspects of the csapr and vacated the rule and remanded it to the u.s. epa for further rulemaking consistent with its decision. on april 29, 2014, the u.s. supreme court reversed the d.c. circuit court decision and upheld csapr, and remanded the case to the d.c. circuit court to resolve the remaining implementation issues on november 21, 2014, the u.s. epa issued an interim final rule in which the agency announced that it was tolling the effective dates for the csapr. the first phase of the csapr program started on january 1, 2015, with the second phase starting january 1, 2017. also released on november 21, 2014, was a notice of data availability under which the agency proposed csapr allowance allocations to generating units for the first five years of the program, 2015-2020; these were identical to those previously identified in prior final rules related to the csapr.
on december 16, 2011, the u.s. epa signed a final rule to reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants from power plants and signed revisions to the nsps for electric generating units. the final rule, known as mats, requires coal-fired electric generation plants to achieve high removal rates of mercury, acid gases and other metals. to achieve these standards, coal units with no pollution control equipment installed (uncontrolled coal units) will have to make capital investments and incur higher operating expenses. it is expected that owners of smaller, older, uncontrolled coal units will retire the units rather than make these investments. coal units with existing controls that do not meet the mats rule may
99
need to upgrade existing controls or add new controls to comply. owners of oil units not currently meeting the proposed emission standards may choose to convert the units to light oils or natural gas, install control technologies, or retire the units. the mats rule requires generating stations to meet the new standards three years after the rule takes effect, april 16, 2015, with specific guidelines for an additional one or two years in limited cases. numerous entities challenged mats in the d.c. circuit court, and exelon intervened in support of the rule. on april 15, 2014, the d.c. circuit court issued an opinion upholding mats in its entirety.
in november 2014, the u.s. supreme court granted a petition for review of the mats rule filed by 20 states and a coalition of coal-fired electric generators. the u.s. supreme court announced that it will review a single, yet critical, aspect of the mats rulewhether the u.s. epa properly considered compliance costs (e.g., pollution control capital expenditures and on-going operations and maintenance expense) in determining whether it is appropriate to regulate hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utilities. if the court finds that the u.s. epa acted unreasonably, then implementation of the rule would be delayed until the u.s. epa corrects any deficiencies. it is likely that the u.s. supreme court will issue a decision sometime in 2015. exelon has been participating in the case as an intervenor in support of the rule.
the u.s. epa continued its regular, periodic review of the naaqs standards. on november 25, 2014, the agency proposed, for public comment, the establishment of a revised primary ozone standard in the range of 65-70 parts per billion (ppb) 8-hour average, a reduction from the 2008 ozone standard level of 75 ppb 8-hour average standard. the agency is also requesting public comment on levels as low as 60 ppb 8-hour average. in its proposal, the agency is also proposing to extend the ozone season on a state-by-state basis from its current may-september five-month period to include months before, and after, the traditional ozone season, depending on air quality monitoring data. most csapr states are proposed to be subjected to a march to october ozone season. in its proposed rule, the agency also elected to set the secondary standard at the same level and form as the primary standard. the agency is expected to issue its final ozone naaqs revision in october 2015. in december 2012, the u.s. epa issued its final revisions to the agencys particulate matter (pm) naaqs. in its final rule, the u.s. epa lowered the annual pm2.5 standard, but declined to issue a new secondary naaqs to improve urban visibility. the u.s. epa indicated in its final rule that by 2020 it expects most areas of the country will be in attainment of the new pm2.5 naaqs based on currently expected regulations, such as the mats regulation.
in addition to these naaqs, the u.s. epa also finalized nonattainment designations for certain areas in the united states for the 2010 one-hour so2 standard on august 5, 2013, and indicated that additional nonattainment areas will be designated in a future rulemaking. u.s. epa will require states to submit state implementation plans (sips) for nonattainment areas by march 25, 2015. with regard to texas and maryland, no nonattainment areas were identified in epas final designation rule. with regard to illinois and pennsylvania, several counties, or portions of counties, in each state were identified as nonattainment. since the 2010 one-hour so2 standard was finalized, epa has issued a series of guidance documents, and proposed a data requirement rule that will be finalized in the summer of 2015 related to requirements for states related to the application of air quality monitoring and modeling in state implementation plans. nonattainment county compliance with the one-hour so2 standard is required by march 25, 2018. while significant so2 reductions will occur as a result of mats compliance in 2015, exelon is unable to predict the requirements of pending states sips to further reduce so2 emissions in support of attainment of the one hour so2 standard.
the cumulative impact of these air regulations could be to require fossil fuel-fired power plant operators to expend significant capital to install pollution control technologies, including wet flue gas desulfurization technology for so2 and acid gases, and selective catalytic reduction technology for nox.
100
in addition, as of december 31, 2014, exelon had a $361 million net investment in coal-fired plants in georgia subject to long-term leases extending through 2028 and 2030. while exelon currently estimates the value of these plants at the end of the lease term will be in excess of the recorded residual lease values, after the impairments recorded in the second quarter of 2013 and 2014, final applications of the csapr and mats regulations could negatively impact the end-of-lease term values of these assets, which could result in a future impairment loss that could be material.
on january 15, 2013, epa issued a final rule for nsps and national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants (neshap) for reciprocating internal combustion engines (rice neshap/nsps). the final rule allows diesel backup generators to operate for up to 100 hours annually under certain emergency circumstances without meeting emissions limitations, but requires units that operate over 15 hours to burn low sulfur fuel and report key engine information. the final rule eliminates after may 2014 the 50 hour exemption for peak shaving and other non-emergency demand response that was included in the proposed rule and, therefore, is not expected to result in additional megawatts of demand response to be bid into the pjm capacity auction.
in the absence of federal legislation, the u.s. epa is also moving forward with the regulation of ghg emissions under the clean air act. on june 25, 2013, president obama announced the presidents climate action plan, a summary of executive branch actions intended to: reduce carbon emissions; prepare the united states for the impacts of climate change; and lead international efforts to combat global climate change and prepare for its impacts. concurrent with the announcement of the administrations plan, the president also issued a memorandum for the administrator of the environmental protection agency that focused on power generation sector carbon reductions under the section 111 new source performance standards (nsps) section of the federal clean air act. the memorandum directs the u.s. epa administrator to issue two sets of proposed rulemakings with regard to power plant carbon emissions under section 111 of the clean air act.
the u.s. epa proposed a section 111(b) regulation for new units in september 2013 that may result in material costs of compliance for co2 emissions for new fossil-fuel electric generating units, particularly coal-fired units. the climate action plan also required the u.s. epa to propose by june 2014 ghg emission regulations for existing stationary sources under section 111(d) of the clean air act, and to issue final regulations by june 2015. that proposed rule was published in the federal register on june 16, 2014. the proposed rule establishes emission reduction targets for each state and provides flexibility for each state to determine how to achieve its required reductions, including heat rate improvements at coal-fired power plants, fuel switching from coal to gas, renewable generation and new nuclear facilities, demand side energy efficiency, and the use of market-based instruments. while the nature and impact of the final regulations is not yet known, to the extent that the rule results in emission reductions from fossil fuel fired plants, imposing some form of direct or indirect price of carbon in competitive electricity markets, exelons overall low-carbon generation portfolio results would benefit.
exelon supports comprehensive climate change legislation or regulation, including a cap-and-trade program for ghg emissions, which balances the need to protect consumers, business and the economy with the urgent need to reduce national ghg emissions.
water quality. section 316(b) of the clean water act requires that cooling water intake structures at electric power plants reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts, and is implemented through state-level npdes permit programs. on october 14, 2014, the u.s. epas final section 316(b) rule became effective. the rule requires that a series of studies and analyses be performed at each facility to determine the best technology available, followed by an implementation period. the timing of the various requirements for each facility is related to the status of its current npdes permit and the subsequent renewal period. there is no fixed compliance schedule, as this is left to the discretion of the state permitting director.
101
until the compliance requirements are determined by the applicable state permitting director on a site-specific basis for each plant, the impact of compliance with the final rule is unknown. should a state permitting director determine that a facility is required to install cooling towers to comply with the rule, that facilitys economic viability would be called into question. however, the likely impact of the rule has been significantly decreased since the final rule does not mandate cooling towers as a national standard, and the state permitting director is required to apply a cost-benefit test and take into consideration site-specific factors.
hazardous and solid waste. on december 19, 2014, the u.s. epa issued the first federal regulation for the disposal of coal combustion residuals (ccr) from power plants, including the classification of ccr as non-hazardous waste under rcra. the epa ruling is effective 180 days after publication in the federal register, which is anticipated in early 2015. under the regulation, ccr will continue to be regulated by most states subject to coordination with the federal regulations. generation has previously recorded reserves consistent with state regulation for its owned coal ash sites, and as such, the regulation is not expected to impact exelons and generations financial results. generation is evaluating what, if any, incremental costs will be incurred for coal ash disposal sites formerly owned by generation that have not yet been closed by their current owners. at this time, however, generation does not have sufficient information to reasonably assess the potential likelihood or magnitude of any remediation requirements that may be asserted for these former sites under the new federal regulations. for these reasons, generation is unable to predict whether and to what extent they may ultimately be held responsible for remediation and other costs relating to formerly owned coal ash disposal sites under the new regulations, and as a result no new liability has been recorded as of december 31, 2014.
see note 22commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail related to environmental matters, including the impact of environmental regulation.
other regulatory and legislative actions nrc task force insights from the fukushima daiichi accident. in july 2011, an nrc task force formed in the aftermath of the march 11, 2011, 9.0 magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami, that seriously damaged the nuclear units at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station, issued a report of its review of the accident, including tiered recommendations for future regulatory action by the nrc to be taken in the near and longer term. the task forces report concluded that nuclear reactors in the united states are operating safely and do not present an imminent risk to public health and safety. the nrc and its staff have issued orders and implementation guidance for commercial reactor licensees operating in the united states. the nrc and its staff are continuing to evaluate additional requirements. generation has assessed the impacts of the tier 1 orders and information requests and will continue monitoring the additional recommendations under review by the nrc staff, both from an operational and a financial impact standpoint. a comprehensive review of the nrc tier 1 orders and information requests, as well as preliminary engineering assumptions and analysis, indicate that the financial impact of compliance for generation, net of expected co-owner reimbursements, for the period from 2015 through 2019 is expected to be between approximately $325 million and $350 million of capital (including approximately $75 million for the ceng plants) and $75 million of operating expense (including approximately $25 million for the ceng plants). as generation completes the design and installation planning for its actions, generation will update these estimates. further, generation estimates incremental costs of $15 to $20 million per unit at thirteen mark 1 and ii units (including two ceng units) for the installation of filters on vents, if ultimately required by the nrc. generations current assessments are specific to the tier 1 recommendations as the nrc has not taken specific action with respect to the tier 2 and tier 3 recommendations. exelon and generation are unable to conclude at this time to what extent any actions to comply with the requirements of tier 2
102
and tier 3 will impact their future financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. generation will continue to engage in nuclear industry assessments and actions and stakeholder input. see item 1a. risk factors and item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsexecutive overview of the exelon 2014 form 10-k, for additional information.
financial reform legislation. the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the act) was enacted in july 2010. the part of the act that applies to exelon is title vii, which is known as the dodd-frank wall street transparency and accountability act (dodd-frank). dodd-frank requires the creation of a new regulatory regime for over-the-counter swaps (swaps), including mandatory clearing for certain categories of swaps, incentives to shift swap activity to exchange trading, margin and capital requirements, and other obligations designed to promote transparency. for non security-based swaps including commodity swaps, dodd-frank empowers the commodity futures trading commission (cftc) to promulgate regulations implementing the laws objectives. the primary aim of dodd-frank is to regulate the key intermediaries in the swaps market, which entities are either swap dealers (sds), major swap participants (msps), and certain other financial entities, but the law also applies to a lesser degree to end-users of swaps. on january 12, 2015, president obama signed into law a bill that exempts from margin requirements swaps used by end-users to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. moreover, the cftcs dodd-frank regulations preserve the ability of end users in the energy industry to hedge their risks using swaps without being subject to mandatory clearing, and excepts or exempts end-users from many of the other substantive regulations. accordingly, as an end-user, generation is conducting its commercial business in a manner that does not require registration with the cftc as an sd or msp. generation does not anticipate transacting in the future in a manner in which it would become a sd or msp.
there are, however, some rulemakings that have not yet been finalized, including the capital and margin rules for (non-cleared) swaps. generation does not expect these rules to directly impact its collateral requirements. however, depending on the substance of these final rules in addition to certain international regulatory requirements still under development and that are similar to dodd-frank, generations swap counterparties could be subject to additional and potentially significant capitalization requirements. these regulations could motivate the sds and msps to increase collateral requirements or cash postings from their counterparties, including generation.
generation continues to monitor the rulemaking proceedings with respect to the capital and margin rules, but cannot predict to what extent, if any, further refinements to dodd-frank requirements may impact its cash flows or financial position, but such impacts could be material.
comed, peco and bge could also be subject to some dodd-frank requirements to the extent they were to enter into swaps. however, at this time, management of comed, peco and bge continue to expect that their companies will not be materially affected by dodd-frank.
energy infrastructure modernization act. since 2011, comeds distribution rates are established through a performance-based rate formula, pursuant to eima. participating utilities are required to file an annual update to the performance-based formula rate tariff on or before may 1, with resulting rates effective in january of the following year. this annual formula rate update is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions. the update also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement(s) in effect for the prior year and actual costs incurred for that year. in addition, comeds earned rate of return on common equity is required to be within plus or minus 50 basis points (the collar) of the target rate of return determined as the annual average rate on 30-year treasury notes plus 580 basis points. therefore, the collar limits favorable and unfavorable impacts of weather and load on distribution revenue. throughout each year, comed records regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and corresponding increases or decreases to operating revenues for any differences between the revenue requirement(s) in effect and comeds best estimate of the revenue requirement expected to be approved by the icc for that years reconciliation.
103
formula rate tariff and annual reconciliation. on april 16, 2014, comed filed its annual distribution formula rate to request a total increase to the revenue requirement of $269 million. on december 11, 2014, the icc issued its final order which increased the revenue requirement by $232 million, reflecting an increase of $160 million for the initial revenue requirement for 2014 and an increase of $72 million related to the annual reconciliation for 2013. approximately $23 million of the total $37 million revenue requirement disallowance is recoverable through other rider-based mechanisms. the rate increase was set using an allowed return on capital of 7.06% (inclusive of an allowed return on common equity of 9.25% for 2014 less a performance metrics penalty of 5 basis points for the 2013 reconciliation). the rates took effect in january 2015. comed and intervenors requested a rehearing on specific issues, which was denied by the icc on january 28, 2015.
grand prairie gateway transmission line. on december 2, 2013, comed filed a request to obtain the iccs approval to construct a 60-mile overhead 345kv transmission line that traverses ogle, dekalb, kane and dupage counties in northern illinois. on may 28, 2014, in a separate proceeding, ferc issued an order granting comeds request to include 100% of the capital costs recorded to construction work in progress during construction of the line in comeds transmission rate base. if the project is cancelled or abandoned for reasons beyond comeds control, ferc approved the ability for comed to recover 100% of its prudent costs incurred after may 21, 2014 and 50% of its costs incurred prior to may 21, 2014 in comeds transmission rate base. on october 22, 2014, the icc issued an order approving comeds grand prairie gateway project over the objection of numerous landowners and the city of elgin. four parties filed timely applications for rehearing before the icc. on november 25, 2014, the icc denied the rehearing application filed by the forest preserve district of kane county, but granted rehearing on the application of certain landowners who requested that the icc consider an alternate route for a three-mile segment of the line in kane county. the rehearing proceeding is currently pending and , the icc must enter a final order on rehearing by april 24, 2015. on december 10, 2014, the icc denied the remaining two applications for rehearing. on january 15, 2015, those two parties, the city of elgin and the skp landowner group and utility risk management corporation (collectively, the skp/urmc party), each filed a notice of appeal with the second district appellate court. on february 3, 2015, the icc filed motions with the second district appellate court seeking to extend the time for the icc to file the record on appeal until after the icc issues its order on rehearing. the icc also filed a motion to consolidate those appeals. comed expects to begin construction of the line in the second quarter of 2015 with an in-service date expected in the second quarter of 2017.
ferc ameren order. in july 2012, ferc issued an order to ameren corporation (ameren) finding that ameren had improperly included acquisition premiums/goodwill in its transmission formula rate, particularly in its capital structure and in the application of afudc. ferc also directed ameren to make refunds for the implied increase in rates in prior years. ameren filed for rehearing of the july 2012 order, which was denied in june 2014. ferc and ameren are in the process of determining the amount of any potential refund. comed believes that the ferc order authorizing its transmission formula rate is distinguishable from the circumstances that led to the july 2012 ferc order in the ameren case. however, if comed were required to exclude acquisition premiums/goodwill from its transmission formula rate, the impact could be material to comeds results of operations and cash flows.
ferc order no. 1000 compliance. in ferc order no. 1000, the ferc required public utility transmission providers to enhance their transmission planning procedures and their cost allocation methods applicable to certain new regional and interregional transmission projects. as part of the changes to the transmission planning procedures, the ferc required removal from all ferc-approved tariffs and agreements of a right of first refusal to build certain new transmission facilities. in compliance with the regional transmission planning requirements of order no. 1000, pjm as the transmission provider submitted a compliance filing to ferc on october 25, 2012. on the same day,
104
certain of the pjm transmission owners, including comed, peco and bge (collectively, the pjm transmission owners), submitted a filing asserting that their contractual rights embodied in the pjm governing documents continue to justify their right of first refusal to construct new reliability (and related) transmission projects and that the ferc should not be allowed to override such rights absent a showing that it is in the public interest to do so under the fercs mobile-sierra standard of review. this is a heightened standard of review which the pjm transmission owners argued could not be satisfied based on the facts applicable to them. on march 22, 2013, ferc issued an order on the pjm compliance filing and the filing of these pjm transmission owners (1) rejecting the arguments of those pjm transmission owners that changes to the pjm governing documents were entitled to review under the mobile-sierra standard, (2) accepting most of the pjm filing, removing the right-of-first refusal from the pjm tariffs, and (3) directing pjm to remove certain exceptions that it included in its compliance filing that ferc found did not comply with order no. 1000. fercs order could enable third parties to seek to build certain regional transmission projects that had previously been reserved for the pjm transmission owners, potentially reducing comeds, pecos and bges financial return on new investments in energy transmission facilities. numerous parties sought rehearing of the fercs march 22, 2013 order, including the pjm transmission owners who sought rehearing of the fercs rejection of their mobile-sierra and related arguments. pjms compliance filing was made on july 22, 2013. on may 15, 2014, ferc denied the rehearing requests except with respect to one issue on when pjm could consider state and local laws in evaluating projects. ferc generally accepted the july 22, 2013, compliance filing but required several minor additional changes. firstenergy and at least one other party filed an appeal of the may 15, 2014, order upholding pjms right of first refusal language in the dc circuit. exelon has intervened in the firstenergy appeal. several parties have filed requests for rehearing or clarification concerning the changes set forth in the may 15, 2014, order. on december 18, 2014, ferc issued an order conditionally accepting part of the pjm-miso interregional order no. 1000 compliance filing, rejecting a miso proposal concerning cost allocation for cross-border reliability projects and directing a further compliance filing by pjm and miso.
ferc transmission complaint. on february 27, 2013, consumer advocates and regulators from the district of columbia, new jersey, delaware and maryland, and the delaware electric municipal cooperatives (the parties), filed a complaint at ferc against bge and the pepco holdings, inc. companies relating to their respective transmission formula rates. bges formula rate includes a 10.8% base rate of return on common equity (roe) and a 50 basis point incentive for participating in pjm (the latter of which is conditioned upon crediting the first 50 basis points of any incentive roe adders). the parties seek a reduction in the base return on equity to 8.7% and changes to the formula rate process. ferc docketed the matter and set april 3, 2013 as the deadline for interventions, protests and answers. under ferc rules, the revenues subject to refund are limited to a fifteen month period, the earliest date from which the base roe could be adjusted and refunds required is the date of the complaint. on march 19, 2013, bge filed a motion to dismiss or sever the complaint.
on august 21, 2014, ferc issued an order in the bge and phi companies proceeding, which established hearing and settlement judge procedures for the complaint, and set a refund effective date of february 27, 2013. bge, the phi companies and the parties began settlement discussions under the guidance of a ferc administrative law judge on september 23, 2014. on november 24, 2014, the settlement judge informed ferc and the chief judge that the parties had reached an impasse and determined that a settlement was not possible. the settlement judge recommended termination of settlement proceedings. on november 26, 2014, the chief judge issued an order terminating the settlement proceeding, designating a presiding judge at the hearings and directing that an initial decision be issued by november 25, 2015.
on december 8, 2014, various state agencies in delaware, maryland, new jersey, and d.c. filed a second complaint against bge regarding the base roe of the transmission business seeking a
105
reduction from 10.8% to 8.8%. the filing of the second complaint creates a second refund window. by order issued on february 9, 2015, ferc established a hearing on the second complaint with the complainants requested refund effective date of december 8, 2014.
based on the current status of the complaint filings, bge believes it is probable that bges base roe rate will be adjusted, and that a refund to customers of transmission revenue for the two maximum fifteen month periods will be required. however, bge is unable to estimate the most likely refund amount for either complaint at this time, and has therefore established a reserve, which is not material, representing the low end of a reasonably possible estimated range of loss. additionally, management is unable to estimate the maximum exposure of a potential refund at this time, which may have a material impact on bges results of operations and cash flows. the estimated annual ongoing reduction in revenues if ferc approved the roes requested by the parties in their filings is approximately $11 million. if ferc were to order a reduction of bges base roe to 8.7% as sought in the first complaint (while retaining the 50 basis points of any incentives that were credited to the base return on equity for certain new transmission investment), the result of the first fifteen month refund window would be a refund to customers of approximately $13 million. if ferc were to order a reduction in bges base roe to 8.8% as sought in the second complaint (while retaining 50 basis points of any incentives that were credited to the base return on equity for certain new transmission investment) and the refund period extended for a full fifteen months, the result would be a refund to customers of approximately $14 million. see note 3regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the maryland strategic infrastructure development and enhancement program. in february 2013, the maryland general assembly passed legislation intended to accelerate gas infrastructure replacements in maryland by establishing a mechanism for gas companies to promptly recover reasonable and prudent costs of eligible infrastructure replacement projects separate from base rate proceedings. on may 2, 2013, the governor of maryland signed the legislation into law; which took effect june 1, 2013. under the new law, following a proceeding before the mdpsc and with the mdpscs approval of the eligible infrastructure replacement projects along with a corresponding surcharge, bge could begin charging gas customers a monthly surcharge for infrastructure costs incurred after june 1, 2013. the legislation includes caps on the monthly surcharges to residential and non-residential customers, and would require an annual true-up of the surcharge revenues against actual expenditures. investment levels in excess of the cap would be recoverable in a subsequent gas base rate proceeding at which time all costs for the infrastructure replacement projects would be rolled into gas distribution rates. irrespective of the cap, bge is required to file a gas rate case every five years under this legislation. on august 2, 2013, bge filed its infrastructure replacement plan and associated surcharge. on january 29, 2014, the mdpsc issued a decision conditionally approving the first five years of bges plan and surcharge. on march 26, 2014, the mdpsc approved as filed bges proposed 2014 project list, tariff and associated surcharge amounts, with a surcharge that became effective april 1, 2014. on november 17, 2014, bge filed a surcharge update including a true-up of costs estimates included in the 2014 surcharge, along with its 2015 project list and cost estimates to be included in the 2015 surcharge. the filing was approved with a revised surcharge effective january 1, 2015. at its december 17, 2014 weekly administrative meeting, the mdpsc approved bges 2015 project list and the proposed surcharge for 2015. bge will defer the difference between the surcharge revenues and program costs as a regulated asset or liability, which was immaterial to exelon and bge as of december 31, 2014.
in february 2014, the residential consumer advocate in maryland filed an appeal with the baltimore city circuit court to the decision issued by the mdpsc on bges infrastructure replacement plan. on september 5, 2014, the baltimore city circuit court affirmed the mdpsc decision on bges infrastructure replacement plan and associated surcharge. on october 10, 2014, the residential
106
consumer advocate noticed its appeal to the maryland court of special appeals from the judgment entered by the baltimore city circuit court, however, a procedural schedule for the matter has not yet been set.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. management discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with its accounting and disclosure governance committee on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the audit committee of the exelon board of directors. management believes that the accounting policies described below require significant judgment in their application, or estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. additional discussion of the application of these accounting policies can be found in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements.
nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligations (exelon and generation)
generations aro associated with decommissioning its nuclear units was $7.0 billion at december 31, 2014. the authoritative guidance requires that generation estimate its obligation for the future decommissioning of its nuclear generating plants. to estimate that liability, generation uses an internally-developed, probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios. the nuclear decommissioning obligation is adjusted on a regular basis due to the passage of time and revisions to the key assumptions for the expected timing or estimated amounts of the future undiscounted cash flows required to decommission the nuclear plants, based upon the methodologies and significant estimates and assumptions described as follows:
decommissioning cost studies. generation uses unit-by-unit decommissioning cost studies to provide a marketplace assessment of the costs and timing of decommissioning activities, which are validated by comparison to current decommissioning projects within its industry and other estimates. decommissioning cost studies are updated, on a rotational basis, for each of generations nuclear units at least every five years.
cost escalation factors. generation uses cost escalation factors to escalate the decommissioning costs from the decommissioning cost studies discussed above through the assumed decommissioning period for each of the units. cost escalation studies, updated on an annual basis, are used to determine escalation factors, and are based on inflation indices for labor, equipment and materials, energy, llrw disposal and other costs.
probabilistic cash flow models. generations probabilistic cash flow models include the assignment of probabilities to various scenarios for decommissioning costs, approaches and timing on a unit-by-unit basis. probabilities assigned to cost levels include an assessment of the likelihood of costs 20% higher (high-cost scenario) or 15% lower (low-cost scenario) than the base cost scenario. probabilities are assigned to alternative decommissioning approaches which assess the likelihood of performing decon (a method of decommissioning shortly after the cessation of operation in which the equipment, structures, and portions of a facility and site containing radioactive contaminants are removed and safely buried in a llrw landfill or decontaminated to a level that permits property to be released for unrestricted use), delayed decon (similar to the decon scenario but with a delay to allow for spent fuel to be removed from the site prior to onset of decommissioning activities) or safstor (a method of decommissioning in which the nuclear facility is placed and maintained in such condition that the nuclear facility can be safely stored and subsequently decontaminated to levels that permit release for unrestricted use generally within 60 years after cessation of operations) decommissioning. probabilities assigned to the timing scenarios incorporate
107
the likelihood of continued operation through current license lives or through anticipated license renewals. generations probabilistic cash flow models also include an assessment of the timing of doe acceptance of snf for disposal. generation assumes doe will begin accepting snf in 2025. the snf acceptance date was based on managements estimates of the amount of time required for doe to select a site location and develop the necessary infrastructure. for more information regarding the estimated date that doe will begin accepting snf, see note 22commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements.
license renewals. generation assumes a successful 20-year renewal for each of its nuclear generating station licenses, except for oyster creek, in determining its nuclear decommissioning aro. the current nrc license for oyster creek expires in 2029. on december 8, 2010, exelon announced that generation will permanently cease generation operations at oyster creek by december 31, 2019. as a result of this decision the expected economic life of oyster creek was reduced by 10 years to correspond to exelons current best estimate as to the timing of ceasing generation operations at the oyster creek unit in 2019. generation has successfully secured 20-year operating license renewal extensions for seventeen of its nuclear units (including the two salem units co-owned by generation, but operated by pseg), and none of generations applications for an operating license extension has been denied. for its remaining seven operating units, generation is in various stages of the process of pursuing similar extensions and has filed license renewal applications for six operating nuclear units and has until 2021 to seek license renewal for one operating nuclear unit. generations assumption regarding license extension for aro determination purposes is based in part on the good current physical condition and high performance of these nuclear units, the favorable status of the ongoing license renewal proceedings with the nrc, and the successful renewals for seventeen units to date. generation estimates that the failure to obtain license renewals at any of these nuclear units (assuming all other assumptions remain constant) would increase its aro on average approximately $300 million per unit as of december 31, 2014. the size of the increase to the aro for a particular nuclear unit is dependent upon the current stage in its original license term and its specific decommissioning cost estimates. if generation does not receive license renewal on a particular unit, the increase to the aro may be mitigated by generations ability to delay ultimate decommissioning activities under a safstor method of decommissioning.
discount rates. the probability-weighted estimated future cash flows using these various scenarios are discounted using credit-adjusted, risk-free rates (carfr) applicable to the various businesses in which each of the nuclear units originally operated. the accounting guidance required generation to establish an aro at fair value at the time of the initial adoption of the current accounting standard. subsequent to the initial adoption, the aro is adjusted for changes to estimated costs, timing of future cash flows and modifications to decommissioning assumptions, as described above.
under the current accounting framework, the aro is not required or permitted to be re-measured for changes in the carfr that occur in isolation. this differs from the accounting requirements for other long-dated obligations, such as pension and other post-employment benefits that are required to be re-measured as and when corresponding discount rates change. if generations future nominal cash flows associated with the aro were to be discounted at current prevailing carfrs, the obligation would increase from approximately $7.0 billion to approximately $8.6 billion. the ultimate decommissioning obligation will be funded by the ndts. the ndts are recorded on exelons and generations consolidated balance sheets at december 31, 2014 at fair value of approximately $10.5 billion and have an estimated targeted annual pre-tax return of 6.0% to 6.3%.
to illustrate the significant impact that changes in the carfr, when combined with changes in projected amounts and expected timing of cash flows, can have on the valuation of the aro: i) had generation used the 2013 carfrs rather than the 2014 carfrs in performing its third quarter 2014 aro update, generation would have reduced the aro by approximately $190 million as compared to
108
the actual decrease to the aro of $125 million; and ii) if the carfr used in performing the third quarter 2014 aro update (which also reflected increases in the amounts and changes to the timing of projected cash flows) was increased or decreased by 100 basis points, the aro would have decreased by $230 million and increased $40 million, respectively, as compared to the actual decrease of $125 million.
aro sensitivities. changes in the assumptions underlying the foregoing items could materially affect the decommissioning obligation. the impact to the aro of a change in any one of these assumptions is highly dependent on how the other assumptions will change as well.
the following table illustrates the effects of changing certain aro assumptions, discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):
change in aro assumption                                                                                                                         increase (decrease) to aro at december 31, 2014
cost escalation studies uniform increase in escalation rates of 25 basis points                                                                                                            $810
probabilistic cash flow models increase the likelihood of the high-cost scenario by 10 percentage points and decrease the likelihood of the low-cost scenario by 10                               $290
percentage points increase the likelihood of the decon scenario by 10 percentage points and decrease the likelihood of the safstor scenario by 10 percentage                         $420
points increase the likelihood of operating through current license lives by 10 percentage points and decrease the likelihood of operating through                        $630
anticipated license renewals by 10 percentage points extend the estimated date for doe acceptance of snf to 2030                                                                                                        $230
extend the estimated date for doe acceptance of snf to 2030 coupled with an increase in discount rates of 100 basis points                                        $(270   )

goodwill (exelon and comed)
as of december 31, 2014, exelons and comeds carrying amount of goodwill was approximately $2.7 billion, relating to the acquisition of comed in 2000 as part of the peco/unicom merger. under the provisions of the authoritative guidance for goodwill, comed is required to perform an assessment for possible impairment of its goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the comed reporting unit below its carrying amount. under the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (known as a component) and is the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment. a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and its operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. comed has a single operating segment for its combined business. there is no level below this operating segment for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. therefore, comeds operating segment is considered its only reporting unit.
109
entities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. in performing a qualitative assessment, entities should assess, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, cost factors, and entity-specific events. if an entity determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount, no further testing is required. if an entity bypasses the qualitative assessment or performs the qualitative assessment, but determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative two-step, fair value-based test is performed. the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. the second step requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets and liabilities using purchase price allocation accounting guidance in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense. application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for comeds business and the fair value of debt. in applying the second step (if needed), management must estimate the fair value of specific assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. see note 1significant accounting policies, note 10intangible assets and note 14income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
purchase accounting (exelon and generation)
in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. the difference between the purchase price amount and the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill on the balance sheet if it exceeds the estimated fair value and as a bargain purchase gain on the income statement if it is below the estimated fair value. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment, the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items. the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization expense. see note 4mergers, acquisitions, and dispositions of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
unamortized energy assets and liabilities (exelon and generation)
unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities represent the remaining unamortized balances of non-derivative energy contracts that generation has acquired. the initial amount recorded represents the fair value of the contract at the time of acquisition, and the balance is amortized over the life of the contract in relation to the present value of the underlying cash flows. amortization expense and income are recorded through purchased power and fuel expense or operating revenues. refer to note 4mergers, acquisitions, and dispositions and note 10intangible assets of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
110
impairment of long-lived assets (exelon, generation, comed, peco and bge)
exelon, generation, comed, peco and bge regularly monitor and evaluate their long-lived assets and asset groups, excluding goodwill, for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. indicators for impairment may include a deteriorating business climate, including current energy prices and market conditions, condition of the asset, specific regulatory disallowance, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life, among others.
the review of long-lived assets and asset groups for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected market conditions. for the generation business, forecasting future cash flows requires assumptions regarding forecasted commodity prices for the sale of power, costs of fuel and the expected operations of assets. a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the recoverability of an asset or asset group and, thus, could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements. an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets or asset groups are largely independent of other groups of assets and liabilities. for the generation business, the lowest level of independent cash flows is determined by evaluation of several factors, including the geographic dispatch of the generation units and the hedging strategies related to those units as well as the associated intangible contract assets recorded on the balance sheet. the cash flows from the generating units are generally evaluated at a regional portfolio level with cash flows generated from the customer supply and risk management activities, including cash flows from contracts that are accounted for as intangible contract assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet. in certain cases generating assets may be evaluated on an individual basis where those assets are contracted on a long-term basis with a third party and operations are independent of other generating assets (typically contracted renewables).
on a quarterly basis, generation assesses its asset groups for indicators of impairment. if indicators are present, a recoverability test is performed. impairment may occur if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value. the fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group is dependent upon a market participants view of the exit price of the assets. this includes significant assumptions of the estimated future cash flows generated by the assets and market discount rates. events and circumstances often do not occur as expected and there will usually be differences between prospective financial information and actual results, and those differences may be material. accordingly, to the extent that any of the information used in the fair value analysis requires judgment, the resulting fair market value would be different. as such, the determination of fair value is driven by both internal assumptions that include significant unobservable inputs (level 3) such as revenue and generation forecasts, projected capital, and maintenance expenditures and discount rates, as well as information from various public, financial and industry sources. an impairment determination would require the affected registrant to reduce the value of either the long-lived asset or asset group, including any associated intangible contract assets and liabilities, as well as current period earnings by the amount of the impairment.
generation evaluates natural gas and oil upstream properties at least annually to determine if they are impaired. impairment for natural gas and oil upstream properties occurs if there are no firm plans to continue drilling, lease expiration is at risk, historical experience indicates a decline in carrying value below fair value or the price of the underlying commodity significantly declines.

exelon holds investments in coal-fired plants in georgia subject to long-term leases. the investments are accounted for as direct financing lease investments. the investments represent the estimated residual values of the leased assets at the end of the respective lease terms. on an annual basis, exelon reviews the estimated residual values of its direct financing lease investments and records an impairment charge if the review indicates an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the residual values below their carrying values. exelon estimates the fair value of the residual values of its direct financing lease investments under the income approach, which uses a discounted cash flow analysis, that takes into consideration significant unobservable inputs (level 3) including the expected revenues to be generated and costs to be incurred to operate the plants over their remaining useful lives subsequent to the lease end dates. significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value include fundamental energy and capacity prices, fixed and variable costs, capital expenditure requirements, discount rates, tax rates, and the estimated remaining useful lives of the plants. the estimated fair values also reflect the cash flows associated with the service contracts associated with the plants given that a market participant would take into consideration all of the terms and conditions contained in the lease agreements.
generation also evaluates its equity method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired based on whether the investment has experienced a decline in value that is not temporary in nature. additionally, if one of generations equity method investments recognizes an impairment, generation would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss through its equity earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates.
see note 8impairment of long-lived assets of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of asset impairment evaluations made by exelon.
depreciable lives of property, plant and equipment (exelon, generation, comed, peco and bge)
the registrants have significant investments in electric generation assets and electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets. depreciation of these assets is generally provided over their estimated service lives on a straight-line basis using the composite method. the registrants complete depreciation studies every five years, or more frequently in an event, regulation action, or change in retirement patterns indicate an update is necessary. the estimation of service lives requires management judgment regarding the period of time that the assets will be in use. as circumstances warrant, the estimated service lives are reviewed to determine if any changes are needed. depreciation rates incorporate assumptions on interim retirements based on actual historical retirement experience. to the extent interim retirement patterns change, this could have a significant impact on the amount of depreciation expense recorded in the income statement. changes to depreciation estimates resulting from a change in the estimated end of service lives could have a significant impact on the amount of depreciation expense recorded in the income statement. see note 1significant accounting policies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding depreciation and estimated service lives of the property, plant and equipment of the registrants.
the estimated service lives of the nuclear generating facilities are based on the estimated useful lives of the stations, which assume a 20-year license renewal extension of the operating licenses for all of generations operating nuclear generating stations except for oyster creek. while generation has received license renewals for certain facilities, and has applied for or expects to apply for and obtain approval of license renewals for the remaining facilities, circumstances may arise that would prevent generation from obtaining additional license renewals. generation also evaluates annually the estimated service lives of its generating facilities based on feasibility assessments as well as economic and capital requirements. the estimated service lives of hydroelectric facilities are based on the
112
remaining useful lives of the stations, which assume a license renewal extension of the conowingo and muddy run operating licenses. a change in depreciation estimates resulting from generations extension or reduction of the estimated service lives could have a significant effect on generations results of operations.
generation completed a depreciation rate study during the first quarter of 2010, which resulted in the implementation of new depreciation rates effective january 1, 2010. constellation completed a depreciation rate study during the fourth quarter of 2010, which resulted in the implementation of new depreciation rates effective during the fourth quarter of 2010.
comed is required to file a depreciation rate study at least every five years with the icc. comed completed a depreciation study and filed the updated depreciation rates with both ferc and the icc in january 2014. this resulted in the implementation of new depreciation rates effective first quarter 2014.
peco is required to file a depreciation rate study at least every five years with the papuc. in april 2010, peco filed a depreciation rate study with the papuc for both its electric and gas assets, which resulted in the implementation of new depreciation rates effective january 1, 2010 for electric transmission assets and january 1, 2011 for electric distribution and gas assets. peco expects to complete an updated depreciation study in 2015 and expects this to result in new depreciation rates effective in the first quarter of 2015 for electric transmission assets and first quarter 2016 for electric distribution and gas assets.
the mdpsc does not mandate the frequency or timing of bges depreciation studies. in july 2014, bge filed revised depreciation rates with the mdpsc for both its electric distribution and gas assets. revisions to depreciation rates from this filing were finalized and effective december 15, 2014.
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits (exelon, generation, comed, peco and bge)
exelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for substantially all generation, comed, peco, bge and bsc employees. see note 16retirement benefits of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.
the measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under exelons defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and accounting policy elections. when developing the required assumptions, exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations. the measurement of benefit obligations and costs is affected by several assumptions including the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs, exelons expected level of contributions to the plans, the incidence of participant mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan participants, the level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, and the long-term expected investment rate credited to employees of certain plans, among others. the assumptions are updated annually and upon any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations. the impact of assumption changes or experience different from that assumed on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is recognized over time rather than immediately recognized in the income statement. gains or losses in excess of the greater of ten percent of the projected benefit obligation or the mrv of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining service period of plan participants. pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the operating companies are labor costs and are ultimately allocated to projects within the operating companies, some of which are capitalized.
113
pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets include equity securities, including u.s. and international securities, and fixed income securities, as well as certain alternative investment classes such as real estate, private equity and hedge funds. see note 16retirement benefits of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for information on fair value measurements of pension and other postretirement plan assets, including valuation techniques and classification under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with authoritative guidance.
expected rate of return on plan assets. the long-term eroa assumption used in calculating pension costs was 7.00%, 7.50% and 7.50% for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 6.59%, 6.45% and 6.68% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the pension trust activity is non-taxable, while other postretirement benefit trust activity is partially taxable. the current year eroa is based on asset allocations from the prior year end. in 2010, exelon began implementation of a liability-driven investment strategy in order to reduce the volatility of its pension assets relative to its pension liabilities. over time, exelon has decreased its equity investments and increased its investments in fixed income securities and alternative investments within the pension asset portfolio in order to achieve a balanced portfolio of liability hedging and return-generating assets. see note 16retirement benefits of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding exelons asset allocations. exelon used an eroa of 7.00% and 6.46% to estimate its 2015 pension and other postretirement benefit costs, respectively.
exelon calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the eroa by the mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments to be made during the year. in determining mrv, the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits allows the use of either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years. for the majority of pension plan assets, exelon uses a calculated value that adjusts for 20% of the difference between fair value and expected mrv of plan assets. use of this calculated value approach enables less volatile expected asset returns to be recognized as a component of pension cost from year to year. for other postretirement benefit plan assets and certain pension plan assets, exelon uses fair value to calculate the mrv.
actual asset returns have an impact on the costs reported for the exelon-sponsored pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the actual asset returns across the registrants pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the year ended december 31, 2014 were 10.93% and 5.01%, respectively, compared to an expected long-term return assumption of 7.00% and 6.59%, respectively.
discount rate. the discount rates used to determine the majority pension and other postretirement benefit obligations were 3.94% and 3.92%, respectively, at december 31, 2014. the discount rates at december 31, 2014 represent weighted-average rates for the majority of pension and other postretirement benefit plans. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the discount rates were determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of high-quality non-callable (or callable with make whole provisions) bonds with similar maturities to the related pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. the spot rates are used to discount the estimated distributions under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve. exelon utilizes an analytical tool developed by its actuaries to determine the discount rates.
the discount rate assumptions used to determine the obligation at year end are used to determine the cost for the following year. exelon used discount rates ranging from 3.94% and 3.92% to estimate the majority its 2015 pension and other postretirement benefit costs, respectively.
114
health care reform legislation. in march 2010, the health care reform acts (the acts) were signed into law. the acts include a provision that imposes an excise tax on certain high-cost plans beginning in 2018, whereby premiums paid over a prescribed threshold will be taxed at a 40% rate. although the excise tax does not go into effect until 2018, accounting guidance requires exelon to incorporate the estimated impact of the excise tax in its annual actuarial valuation. the application of the legislation is still unclear and exelon continues to monitor the department of labor and irs for additional guidance. effective in 2002, constellation amended its other postretirement benefit plans for all subsidiaries other than nine mile point by capping retiree medical coverage for future retirees who were under the age of 55 on january 1, 2002 at 2002 levels. therefore, the excise tax is not expected to have a material impact on the legacy constellation other postretirement benefit plans. although exelon has capped the rate of claims growth for certain legacy exelon plan participants over age 65, exposure to the excise tax remains. certain key assumptions are required to estimate the impact of the excise tax on the other postretirement obligation for legacy exelon plans, including projected inflation rates (based on the cpi), and under what circumstances pre- and post-65 retiree benefits can be aggregated in determining the premium values of health care benefits. exelon reflected its best estimate of the expected impact in its annual actuarial valuation.
health care cost trend rate. assumed health care cost trend rates impact the costs reported for exelons other postretirement benefit plans for participant populations with plan designs that do not have a cap on cost growth. accounting guidance requires that annual health care cost estimates be developed using past and present health care cost trends (both for exelon and across the broader economy), as well as expectations of health care cost escalation, changes in health care utilization and delivery patterns, technological advances and changes in the health status of plan participants. therefore, the trend rate assumption is subject to significant uncertainty. exelon assumed an initial health care cost trend rate of 6.00% for 2014, decreasing to an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5.00% in 2017.
mortality. the mortality assumption is composed of a base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy. exelon historically used a mortality base table for its accounting valuation that is consistent with the irs required table for funding (referred to as rp-2000) and its corresponding improvement scale. during 2014, the society of actuaries (soa) issued an updated mortality table (referred to as rp-2014) and improvement scale that suggests significant mortality improvement over the prior table. exelon has a substantial employee population that provides a credible basis for mortality evaluation. exelon engaged its actuaries to conduct a mortality study of exelons actual experience over a five year period as compared to the rp-2000 and rp-2014 tables, which resulted in a determination that the rp-2000 more closely aligns with exelons actual mortality experience. the study also considered available improvement scales. management concluded that the rp-2000 and a more recent improvement scale issued by the soa with certain adjustments to long-term improvement rates represent its best estimate of mortality. exelon is utilizing the scale bb 2-dimensional improvement scale with long-term improvements of 0.75% (as compared to the 1% incorporated in the issued table) for its mortality improvement assumption. the change in assumption resulted in increases of $361 million and $117 million in the pension and other postretirement benefits obligations, respectively and an increase in 2015 cost of $45 million and $20 million for pension and other postretirement benefits, respectively.

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions. the following tables illustrate the effects of changing certain of the actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):

(a)                                        in general, the discount rate will have a larger impact on the pension and other postretirement benefit cost and obligation as the rate moves closer to 0%. therefore, the discount rate sensitivities above cannot necessarily be extrapolated for larger increases or decreases in the discount rate. additionally, exelon implemented a liability-driven investment strategy for a portion of its pension asset portfolio in
2010. the sensitivities shown above do not reflect the offsetting impact that changes in discount rates may have on pension asset returns.

(b)   changes in the plan design of certain other postretirement benefit plans have resulted in reduced sensitivity to the health care cost trend rate.

average remaining service period. for pension benefits, exelon amortizes its unrecognized prior service costs and certain actuarial gains and losses, as applicable, based on participants average remaining service periods. the average remaining service period of defined benefit pension plan participants was 11.8 years, 11.8 years and 11.9 years for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
for other postretirement benefits, exelon amortizes its unrecognized prior service costs over participants average remaining service period to benefit eligibility age and amortizes its transition obligations and certain actuarial gains and losses over participants average remaining service period to expected retirement. the average remaining service period of postretirement benefit plan participants related to benefit eligibility age was 9.1 years, 8.7 years and 8.9 years for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the average remaining service period of postretirement benefit plan participants related to expected retirement was 10.1 years, 9.8 years and 10.1 years for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
regulatory accounting (exelon, comed, peco and bge)
exelon, comed, peco and bge account for their regulated electric and gas operations in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulations, which requires exelon, comed, peco and bge to reflect the effects of cost-based rate regulation in their financial statements. this guidance is applicable to entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: (1) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (2) rates are designed to recover the entities cost of providing services or products; and (3) a reasonable expectation that rates are set at levels that will recover the entities costs from customers. regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. regulatory liabilities represent (1) the excess recovery of costs or
116
accrued credits that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates; or (2) billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs. as of december 31, 2014, exelon, comed, peco and bge have concluded that the operations of comed, peco and bge meet the criteria to apply the authoritative guidance. if it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of those operations no longer meets the criteria of this guidance, exelon, comed, peco and bge would be required to eliminate any associated regulatory assets and liabilities and the impact would be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and could be material. see note 3regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding regulatory matters, including the regulatory assets and liabilities tables of exelon, comed, peco and bge.
for each regulatory jurisdiction in which they conduct business, exelon, comed, peco and bge assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. this assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in comeds, pecos and bges jurisdictions, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. furthermore, exelon, comed, peco and bge make other judgments related to the financial statement impact of their regulatory environments, such as the types of adjustments to rate base that will be acceptable to regulatory bodies, if any, to which costs will be recoverable through rates. refer to the revenue recognition discussion below for additional information on the annual revenue reconciliations associated with comeds distribution formula rate tariff, pursuant to eima, and ferc-approved transmission formula rate tariffs for comed and bge. additionally, estimates are made in accordance with the authoritative guidance for contingencies as to the amount of revenues billed under certain regulatory orders that may ultimately be refunded to customers upon finalization of applicable regulatory or judicial processes. these assessments are based, to the extent possible, on past relevant experience with regulatory bodies in comeds, pecos and bges jurisdictions, known circumstances specific to a particular matter and hearings held with the applicable regulatory body. if the assessments and estimates made by exelon, comed, peco and bge are ultimately different than actual regulatory outcomes, the impact on their results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be material.
the registrants treat the impacts of a final rate order received after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements as a non-recognized subsequent event, as the receipt of a final rate order is a separate and distinct event that has future impacts on the parties affected by the order.
accounting for derivative instruments (exelon, generation, comed, peco and bge)
the registrants utilize derivative instruments to manage their exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, changes in interest rates related to planned future debt issuances and changes in the fair value of outstanding debt. generation uses a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage the commodity price risk of its electric generation facilities, including power sales, fuel and energy purchases and other energy-related products marketed and purchased. additionally, generation enters into energy-related derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. comed has entered into contracts to procure energy, capacity and ancillary services. in addition, comed had a financial swap contract with generation that expired may 31, 2013 and currently holds floating-to-fixed energy swaps with several unaffiliated suppliers that extend into 2032. peco and bge have entered into derivative natural gas contracts to hedge their long-term price risk in the natural gas market. peco has also entered into derivative contracts to procure electric supply through a competitive rfp process as outlined in its papuc-approved dsp program. bge has also entered into derivative contracts to procure electric supply through a competitive auction process as outlined in its mdpsc-approved sos program. comed, peco and bge do not enter into derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. the
117
registrants derivative activities are in accordance with exelons risk management policy (rmp). see note 12derivative financial instruments of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the registrants derivative instruments.
the registrants account for derivative financial instruments under the applicable authoritative guidance. determining whether or not a contract qualifies as a derivative under this guidance requires that management exercise significant judgment, including assessing the market liquidity as well as determining whether a contract has one or more underlyings and one or more notional amounts. further, interpretive guidance related to the authoritative literature continues to evolve, including how it applies to energy and energy-related products. changes in managements assessment of contracts and the liquidity of their markets, and changes in authoritative guidance related to derivatives, could result in previously excluded contracts being subject to the provisions of the authoritative derivative guidance. generation has determined that contracts to purchase uranium, contracts to purchase and sell capacity in certain isos, certain emission products and recs do not meet the definition of a derivative under the current authoritative guidance since they do not provide for net settlement and neither the uranium, certain capacity, emission nor the rec markets are sufficiently liquid to conclude that physical forward contracts are readily convertible to cash. if these markets do become sufficiently liquid in the future and generation would be required to account for these contracts as derivative instruments, the fair value of these contracts would be accounted for consistent with generations other derivative instruments. in this case, if market prices differ from the underlying prices of the contracts, generation would be required to record mark-to-market gains or losses, which may have a significant impact to exelons and generations financial positions and results of operations.
under current authoritative guidance, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, except for certain derivatives that qualify for, and are elected under, the normal purchases and normal sales exception. further, derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as fair value or cash flow hedges. for fair value hedges, changes in fair values for both the derivative and the underlying hedged exposure are recognized in earnings each period. for cash flow hedges, the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting the change in the hedged cash flows of the underlying exposure is deferred in accumulated oci and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. gains and losses from the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized in earnings immediately. for commodity transactions, effective with the date of the constellation merger, generation no longer utilizes the election provided for by the cash flow hedge designation and de-designated all of its existing cash flow hedges prior to the constellation merger. because the underlying forecasted transactions remain probable, the fair value of the effective portion of these cash flow hedges was frozen in accumulated oci and will be reclassified to results of operations when the forecasted purchase or sale of the energy commodity occurs, or becomes probable of not occurring. none of constellations designated cash flow hedges for commodity transactions prior to the constellation merger were re-designated as cash flow hedges. the effect of this decision is that all economic hedges for commodities are recorded at fair value through earnings for the combined company. in addition, for energy-related derivatives entered into for proprietary trading purposes, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings each period. for economic hedges that are not designated for hedge accounting for comed, peco and bge, changes in the fair value each period are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability.
normal purchases and normal sales exception. as part of generations energy marketing business, generation enters into contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of its customers. these contracts include short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products in the retail and wholesale markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery. while some of these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments under the authoritative guidance, certain of these qualifying transactions have been designated as normal purchases and normal sales and are thus not required to be recorded at fair value, but rather
118
on an accrual basis of accounting. determining whether a contract qualifies for the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires that management exercise judgment on whether the contract will physically deliver and requires that management ensure compliance with all of the associated qualification and documentation requirements. revenues and expenses on contracts that qualify as normal purchases and normal sales are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed. contracts which qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception are those for which physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time and is not financially settled on a net basis. the contracts that comed has entered into with suppliers as part of comeds energy procurement process, pecos full requirement contracts and block contracts under the papuc-approved dsp program, most of pecos natural gas supply agreements and all of bges full requirement contracts and natural gas supply agreements that are derivatives qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception.
commodity contracts. identification of a commodity contract as an economic hedge requires generation to determine that the contract is in accordance with the rmp. generation reassesses its economic hedges on a regular basis to determine if they continue to be within the guidelines of the rmp.
as a part of accounting for derivatives, the registrants make estimates and assumptions concerning future commodity prices, load requirements, interest rates, the timing of future transactions and their probable cash flows, the fair value of contracts and the expected changes in the fair value in deciding whether or not to enter into derivative transactions, and in determining the initial accounting treatment for derivative transactions. in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, the registrants categorize these derivatives under a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. exchange-based derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. certain derivatives pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges are categorized in level 2. these price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices and are obtained from sources that the registrants believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity. the price quotations are reviewed and corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an orderly transaction between market participants. this includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration. the registrants derivatives are traded predominately at liquid trading points. the remaining derivative contracts are valued using the black model, an industry standard option valuation model. the black model takes into account inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, and assumptions of the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit worthiness and credit spread. for derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, the model inputs are generally observable. such instruments are categorized in level 2. for derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, the model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. in instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. this includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration. such instruments are categorized in level 3 as the model inputs generally are not observable. the registrants consider nonperformance risk, including credit risk in the valuation of derivative contracts categorized in level 1, 2 and 3, including both historical and current market data in its assessment of nonperformance risk, including credit risk. the impacts of credit and nonperformance risk to date have generally not been material to the financial statements.
interest rate and foreign exchange derivative instruments. the registrants may utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve the targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percent of total debt. additionally, the registrants
119
may use forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to lock in interest-rate levels in anticipation of future financings and floating to fixed swaps for project financing. in addition, generation enters into interest rate derivative contracts to economically hedge risk associated with the interest rate component of commodity positions. the characterization of the interest rate derivative contracts between the economic hedge and proprietary trading activity is driven by the corresponding characterization of the underlying commodity position that gives rise to the interest rate exposure. generation does not utilize interest rate derivatives with the objective of benefiting from shifts or change in market interest rates. to manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than u.s. dollars, generation utilizes foreign currency derivatives, which are typically designated as economic hedges. the fair value of the agreements is calculated by discounting the future net cash flows to the present value based on the terms and conditions of the agreements and the forward interest rate and foreign exchange curves. as these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives are primarily categorized in level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. certain exchange based interest rate derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.

taxation (exelon, generation, comed, peco and bge)
significant management judgment is required in determining the registrants provisions for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances. in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. if it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the registrants consolidated financial statements.
the registrants evaluate quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and their intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. the registrants also assess their ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. the registrants record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the registrants conclude it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, the registrants forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. while the registrants believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance, the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or
120
unfavorable adjustments to their consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material. see note 14income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding taxes.
accounting for loss contingencies (exelon, generation, comed, peco and bge)
in the preparation of their financial statements, the registrants make judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record liabilities for loss contingencies that are probable and can be reasonably estimated based upon available information. the amounts recorded may differ from the actual expense incurred when the uncertainty is resolved. the estimates that the registrants make in accounting for loss contingencies and the actual results that they record upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties could have a significant effect on their consolidated financial statements.
environmental costs. environmental investigation and remediation liabilities are based upon estimates with respect to the number of sites for which the registrants will be responsible, the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site, the portion of costs that will be shared with other parties, the timing of the remediation work, changes in technology, regulations and the requirements of local governmental authorities. periodic studies are conducted at comed, peco and bge to determine future remediation requirements and estimates are adjusted accordingly. in addition, periodic reviews are performed at generation to assess the adequacy of its environmental reserves. these matters, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a significant effect on the registrants results of operations, financial position and cash flows. see note 22commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.
other, including personal injury claims. the registrants are self-insured for general liability, automotive liability, workers compensation, and personal injury claims to the extent that losses are within policy deductibles or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. the registrants have reserves for both open claims asserted and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported (ibnr). the ibnr reserve is estimated based on actuarial assumptions and analysis and is updated annually. future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding litigation and possible state and national legislative measures could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than estimated. accordingly, these claims, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a material effect on the registrants results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
revenue recognition (exelon, generation, comed, peco and bge)
sources of revenue and selection of accounting treatment. the registrants earn revenues from various business activities including: the sale of energy and energy-related products, such as natural gas, capacity, and other commodities in non-regulated markets (wholesale and retail); the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas in regulated markets; and the provision of other energy-related non-regulated products and services.
the appropriate accounting treatment for revenue recognition is based on the nature of the underlying transaction and applicable accounting standards. the registrants primarily use accrual and mark-to-market accounting as discussed in more detail below.
accrual accounting. under accrual accounting, the registrants record revenues in the period when services are rendered or energy is delivered to customers. the registrants generally use accrual accounting to recognize revenues for sales of electricity, natural gas, and other commodities as part of their physical delivery activities. the registrants enter into these sales transactions using a variety of instruments, including non-derivative agreements, derivatives that qualify for and are designated as
121
normal purchases and normal sales (npns) of commodities that will be physically delivered, sales to utility customers under regulated service tariffs, and spot-market sales, including settlements with independent system operators.
mark-to-market accounting. the registrants record revenues and expenses using the mark-to-market method of accounting for transactions that meet the definition of a derivative for which they are not permitted, or have not elected, the npns exception. these mark-to-market transactions primarily relate to risk management activities and economic hedges of other accrual activities. mark-to-market revenues and expenses include: inception gains or losses on new transactions where the fair value is observable and realized; and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of open contracts.
use of estimates. estimates are based upon actual costs incurred and investments in rate base for the period and the rates of return on common equity and associated regulatory capital structure allowed under the applicable tariff. the estimated reconciliations can be affected by, among other things, variances in costs incurred and investments made and actions by regulators or courts.
unbilled revenues. the determination of generations, comeds, pecos and bges retail energy sales to individual customers is based on systematic readings of customer meters generally on a monthly basis. at the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated, and corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. the measurement of unbilled revenue is affected by the following factors: daily customer usage measured by generation or gas throughput volume, customer usage by class, losses of energy during delivery to customers and applicable customer rates. increases or decreases in volumes delivered to the utilities customers and favorable or unfavorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. in addition, volumes may fluctuate monthly as a result of customers electing to use an alternate supplier, which could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue since unbilled commodity receivables are not recorded for these customers. changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the measurement of unbilled revenue; however, total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged.
see note 6accounts receivable of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
regulated transmission & distribution revenues. comeds eima distribution formula rate tariff provides for annual reconciliations to the distribution revenue requirement. as of the balance sheet dates, comed has recorded its best estimates of the distribution revenue impact resulting from changes in rates that comed believes are probable of approval by the icc in accordance with the formula rate mechanism. estimates are based upon actual costs incurred and investments in rate base for the period and the rates of return on common equity and associated regulatory capital structure allowed under the applicable tariff. the estimated reconciliation can be affected by, among other things, variances in costs incurred and investments made and actions by regulators or courts.
comeds and bges ferc transmission formula rate tariffs provide for annual reconciliations to the transmission revenue requirements. as of the balance sheet dates, comed and bge have recorded the best estimate of their respective transmission revenue impact resulting from changes in rates that comed and bge believe are probable of approval by ferc in accordance with the formula rate mechanism. estimates are based upon actual costs incurred and investments in rate base for the period and the rates of return on common equity and associated regulatory capital structure allowed under the applicable tariff. the estimated reconciliation can be affected by, among other things, variances in costs incurred and investments made and actions by regulators or courts.
122
allowance for uncollectible accounts (exelon, generation, comed, peco and bge)
the allowance for uncollectible accounts reflects the registrants best estimates of losses on the accounts receivable balances. for generation, the allowance is based on accounts receivable aging historical experience and other currently available information. comed and peco estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by applying loss rates developed specifically for each company to the outstanding receivable balance by customer risk segment. at december 31, 2013, bge estimated the allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by assigning a reserve factor for each aging bucket. these percentages were derived from a study of billing progression which determined the reserve factors by aging bucket. at december 31, 2014, bge changed to a methodology for estimating the allowance for uncollectible accounts, which was consistent with comed and peco, as described above. risk segments represent a group of customers with similar credit quality indicators that are computed based on various attributes, including delinquency of their balances and payment history. loss rates applied to the accounts receivable balances are based on historical average charge-offs as a percentage of accounts receivable in each risk segment. comed, peco and bge customers accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the time the next bill is issued, which normally occurs on a monthly basis. comed, peco and bge customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. comeds, pecos and bges provisions for uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in volume, prices and economic conditions as well as changes in icc, papuc and mdpsc regulations, respectively. see note 6accounts receivable of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding accounts receivable.

124
net income attributable to membership interest year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013. generations net income attributable to membership interest decreased compared to the same period in 2013 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense; partially offset by higher revenue, net of purchase power and fuel expense, higher other income, the gains recorded on the sale of generations ownership interest in generating stations, the bargain-purchase gain recorded related to the integrys acquisition, and the gain recorded upon consolidation of ceng. the increase in operating and maintenance expense was largely due to increased labor contracting and materials expense due to the inclusion of cengs results beginning april 1, 2014 and impairment charges related to 1) generating assets held-for-sale, 2) certain upstream assets, and 3) wind generating assets. the increase in revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense was primarily due to the inclusion of cengs results beginning april 1, 2014, a decrease in fuel costs related to the cancellation of doe spent nuclear fuel disposal fees, an increase in capacity prices, and favorable portfolio management activities in the new england an south regions, partially offset by lower realized energy prices related to executing exelons ratable hedging strategy, higher procurement costs for replacement power due to extreme cold weather in the first quarter of 2014, and unrealized mark-to-market losses in 2014. the increase in other income is primarily the result of increased realized and unrealized gain on ndt funds.
year ended december 31, 2013 compared to year ended december 31, 2012. generations net income attributable to membership interest increased compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to higher revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense, lower operating and maintenance expense and higher earnings from generations interest in ceng; partially offset by impairment of certain generating assets, higher depreciation expense, higher property taxes, and higher interest expense. the increase in revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense was primarily due to increased capacity prices and higher nuclear volume, partially offset by lower realized energy prices, higher nuclear fuel costs, and lower mark-to-market gains in 2013. the decrease in operating and maintenance expense was largely due to 2012 costs associated with a settlement with ferc in 2012 and decreases in transaction costs and employee-related costs associated with the merger.

mid-atlantic year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in the mid-atlantic of $147 million was primarily due to the consolidation of ceng, the cancellation of the doe spent nuclear fuel disposal fees, and favorable portfolio management optimization activities, partially offset by higher procurement costs for replacement power, lower nuclear volumes (excluding ceng), lower capacity revenues, and lower realized energy prices related to executing generations ratable hedging strategy.
year ended december 31, 2013 compared to year ended december 31, 2012. the decrease in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in the mid-atlantic of $163 million was primarily due to lower realized energy prices and increased nuclear fuel costs, partially offset by the addition of constellation in 2012, higher capacity revenues, and higher nuclear revenues.
midwest year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in the midwest of $8 million was primarily due to higher capacity prices, higher nuclear volumes, and the cancellation of the doe spent nuclear fuel disposal fee, partially offset by lower realized energy prices related to executing generations ratable hedging strategy.
year ended december 31, 2013 compared to year ended december 31, 2012. the decrease in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in the midwest of $412 million was primarily due to lower realized energy prices, increased nuclear fuel costs, and lower capacity revenues, partially offset by higher nuclear revenues.
new england year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013. the $166 million increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in new england is primarily due to higher realized energy prices and favorable impacts from the restructuring of a fuel supply contract, partially offset by lower generation volume.
year ended december 31, 2013 compared to year ended december 31, 2012. the $11 million decrease in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in new england is primarily due to lower realized energy prices, partially offset by the addition of constellation in 2012. prior to the merger, new england was not a significant contributor to revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense at generation.
new york year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013. the $487 million increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in new york was primarily due to the consolidation of ceng.
year ended december 31, 2013 compared to year ended december 31, 2012. the $80 million decrease in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in new york was primarily due to decreased realized energy prices, partially offset by the addition of constellation. prior to the merger, new york was not a significant contributor to revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense at generation.
129
ercot year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013. the $119 million decrease in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in ercot was primarily due to higher procurement costs for replacement power in the second quarter of 2014 and the termination of an energy supply contract with a retail power supply company that was previously a consolidated variable interest entity. as a result of the termination, generation no longer has a variable interest in the retail supply company and ceased consolidation of the entity during the third quarter of 2013. the decreases were partially offset by higher generation volume in the first quarter of 2014.
year ended december 31, 2013 compared to year ended december 31, 2012. the $31 million increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in ercot was primarily due to increased realized energy prices and the addition of constellation in 2012, partially offset by a decrease due to the termination of an energy supply contract with a retail power supply company that was previously a consolidated variable interest entity. as a result of the termination, generation no longer has a variable interest in the retail supply company and ceased consolidation of the entity during the third quarter of 2013.
other regions year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013. the $126 million increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in other regions was primarily due to higher generation volumes and higher realized energy prices.
year ended december 31, 2013 compared to year ended december 31, 2012. the $70 million increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in other regions was primarily as a result of the addition of constellation in 2012, in addition to increased renewable generation.
mark-to-market year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013. generation is exposed to market risks associated with changes in commodity prices and enters into economic hedges to mitigate exposure to these fluctuations. mark-to-market losses on economic hedging activities were $591 million in 2014 compared to gains of $504 million in 2013. see note 11fair value of financial assets and liabilities and note 12derivative financial instruments of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on gains and losses associated with mark-to-market derivatives.
year ended december 31, 2013 compared to year ended december 31, 2012. generation is exposed to market risks associated with changes in commodity prices and enters into economic hedges to mitigate exposure to these fluctuations. mark-to-market gains on economic hedging activities were $504 million in 2013 compared to gains of $515 million in 2012. see note 11fair value of financial assets and liabilities and note 12derivative financial instruments of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on gains and losses associated with mark-to-market derivatives.
other year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013. the $265 million increase in other revenue net of purchased power and fuel was primarily due to a reduction in amortization of in-the-money energy contracts recorded at fair value at the constellation merger date and an increase related to the amortization of out-of-the money energy contracts recorded at fair value
130
upon the consolidation of ceng partially offset by a loss on gas inventory from lower of cost or market adjustments in 2014. see note 10intangible assets of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding contract intangibles.
year ended december 31, 2013 compared to year ended december 31, 2012. the $627 million increase in other revenue net of purchased power and fuel was primarily due to reduced amortization expense of the acquired energy contracts recorded at fair value at the merger date. in addition, the increase is also attributable to results from activities acquired as part of the 2012 merger with constellation including retail gas, energy efficiency, energy management and demand response, upstream natural gas, and the design and construction of renewable energy facilities. these increases were partially offset by the reduction in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense from the sale of brandon shores, h.a. wagner and c.p. crane, the generating facilities divested in the fourth quarter of 2012 as a result of the exelon and constellation merger. see note 10intangible assets of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding contract intangibles and assets planned for divestiture as a result of the constellation merger.
nuclear fleet capacity factor and production costs the following table presents nuclear fleet operating data for 2014, as compared to 2013 and 2012, for the generation-operated plants. the nuclear fleet capacity factor presented in the table is defined as the ratio of the actual output of a plant over a period of time to its output if the plant had operated at full average annual mean capacity for that time period. nuclear fleet production cost is defined as the costs to produce one mwh of energy, including fuel, materials, labor, contracting and other miscellaneous costs, but excludes depreciation, required capital investment, benefits costs associated with labor, insurance, property taxes, unit contingent costs, suspended doe nuclear waste storage fee (as discussed further in note 22commitments and contingencies), and certain other non-production related overhead costs. generation considers capacity factor and production costs useful measures to analyze the nuclear fleet performance between periods. generation has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with gaap. however, these measures are not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies presentations or be more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report.
2014                2013                2012
nuclear fleet capacity factor (a)                    94.3   %            94.1   %            92.7   %
nuclear fleet production cost per mwh (a)          $19.33              $19.83              $19.50
(a)   excludes salem, which is operated by pseg nuclear, llc. reflects ownership percentage of stations operated by exelon. as of april 1, 2014, ceng is included at ownership.

year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013. the nuclear fleet capacity factor, which excludes salem, increased in 2014 compared to 2013. while total days offline are greater in 2014 as compared to 2013, the larger capacity units were online for more days in 2014. additionally, with the addition of the ceng nuclear facilities there were more days offline in 2014 associated with units where exelons ownership percentage diminishes the impact on capacity factor. for 2014 and 2013, planned refueling outage days totaled 275 and 233, respectively, and non-refueling outage days totaled 92 and 75, respectively. production cost per mwh was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 due to elimination of the snf disposal fee in 2014, partially offset by inclusion of the ownership share of ceng.
year ended december 31, 2013 compared to year ended december 31, 2012. the nuclear fleet capacity factor, which excludes salem, increased primarily due to a lower number of planned refueling outage days in 2013, partially offset by a higher number of non-refueling outage days. for 2013 and
131
2012, planned refueling outage days totaled 233 and 274, respectively, and non-refueling outage days totaled 75 and 73, respectively. higher nuclear fuel costs and higher plant operating and maintenance costs, partially offset by higher number of net mwhs generated resulted in a higher production cost per mwh during 2013 as compared to 2012.

(a)                                      comed evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power expense. comed believes that revenue net of purchased power expense is a useful measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. in general, comed only earns margin based on the delivery and transmission of electricity. comed has included its discussion of revenue net of purchased power expense below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with gaap. however, revenue net of purchased power expense is not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies
presentations or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report.

net income year ended december 31, 2014, compared to year ended december 31, 2013. comeds net income for the year ended december 31, 2014, was higher than the same period in 2013, primarily due
135
to the 2013 remeasurement of exelons like-kind exchange tax position, and increased electric distribution and transmission earnings resulting from increased capital investment, partially offset by unfavorable weather.
year ended december 31, 2013, compared to year ended december 31, 2012. comeds net income for the year ended december 31, 2013, was lower than the same period in 2012, primarily due to the remeasurement of exelons like-kind exchange tax position and unfavorable weather, partially offset by increased electric distribution and transmission earnings resulting from increased costs and capital investments and higher allowed roe. see note 3regulatory matters and note 14income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements in the 2013 10-k for additional information.
operating revenue net of purchased power expense there are certain drivers of operating revenue that are fully offset by their impact on purchased power expense, such as commodity procurement costs and participation in customer choice programs. comed is permitted to recover electricity procurement costs from retail customers without mark-up. therefore, fluctuations in electricity procurement costs have no impact on revenue net of purchased power expense. see note 3regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on comeds electricity procurement process.
all comed customers have the choice to purchase electricity from a competitive electric generation supplier. customer choice programs do not impact comeds volume of deliveries, but do affect comeds operating revenue related to supplied energy, which is fully offset in purchased power expense. therefore, customer choice programs have no impact on revenue net of purchased power expense.
the number of retail customers participating in customer choice programs was 2,426,921, 2,630,185 and 1,627,150 at december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, representing 63%, 68% and 43% of total retail customers, respectively. retail energy purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers represented 80%, 81% and 65% of comeds retail kwh sales for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the changes in comeds revenue net of purchased power expense for the year ended 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 consisted of the following:
increase weather                                             $(16   )
electric distribution revenue                         (2   )

increase in revenue net of purchased power           $97
weather the demand for electricity is affected by weather conditions. very warm weather in summer months and very cold weather in other months are referred to as favorable weather conditions
136
because these weather conditions result in increased customer usage. conversely, mild weather reduces demand. for the year ended december 31, 2014, unfavorable weather conditions, primarily during the summer months, reduced operating revenue net of purchased power expense when compared to prior year.
heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 30-year period in comeds service territory with cooling degree days generally having a more significant impact to comed, particularly during the summer months. the changes in heating and cooling degree days in comeds service territory for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 consisted of the following:
twelve months ended december 31,                 % change heating and cooling degree-days   2014                        2013                    normal        from 2013                from normal heating degree-days                           7,027                           6,603         6,341          6.4%                      10.8%

volume for the year ended december 31, 2014 revenue net of purchased power expense remained relatively consistent, as compared to the same period in 2013.
electric distribution revenue eima provides for a performance-based formula rate tariff, which requires an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect to the actual costs that the icc determines are prudently and reasonably incurred in a given year. under eima, distribution revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered, allowed roe, and other billing determinants. in addition, comeds allowed rate of return on common equity is the annual average rate on 30-year treasury notes plus 580 basis points, subject to a collar of plus or minus 50 basis points. therefore, the collar limits favorable and unfavorable impacts of weather and load on revenue. during the year ended december 31, 2014, distribution revenue decreased $2 million at comed, primarily due to lower operating and maintenance expenses primarily driven by the impacts of certain opeb plan design changes, partially offset by increased capital investment. see operating and maintenance expense below, item 1. businesscommonwealth edison company, note 3regulatory matters and note 16retirement benefits of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
transmission revenue under a ferc approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered and other billing determinants, such as the highest daily peak load from the previous calendar year. during the year ended december 31, 2014, comed recorded increased revenue of $30 million due to increased capital investments. see note 3regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
regulatory required programs this represents the change in operating revenue collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as comeds energy efficiency and demand response and purchase power administrative costs. the riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery.
137
the costs of these programs are included in operating and maintenance expense. refer to the operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.
uncollectible accounts recovery, net uncollectible accounts recovery, net represents recoveries under comeds uncollectible accounts tariff. see the operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on this tariff.
pricing and customer mix the increase in revenue net of purchased power as a result of pricing and customer mix is primarily attributable to higher overall effective rates due to decreased usage across all major customer classes and change in customer mix for the years ended december 31, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
revenue subject to refund comed records revenue subject to refund based upon its best estimate of customer collections that may be required to be refunded. for the year ended december 31, 2014, comed recorded $9 million of revenue subject to refund associated with rider amp. see note 3regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other other revenue, which can vary period to period, includes rental revenue, revenue related to late payment charges, assistance provided to other utilities through mutual assistance programs and recoveries of environmental costs associated with mgp sites, recovery of energy procurement costs, for which an equal and offsetting amount is reflected in depreciation and amortization expense during the periods presented.

increase in revenue net of purchased power                         $154
weather for the year ended december 31, 2013, the increase in revenue net of purchased power expense was offset by unfavorable weather conditions as a result of the mild weather in 2013 compared to the same period in 2012.
138
the changes in heating and cooling degree days in comeds service territory for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 consisted of the following:

volume revenue net of purchased power expense decreased as a result of lower delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended december 31, 2013, reflecting decreased average usage per residential customer as compared to the same period in 2012.
electric distribution revenue during the year ended december 31, 2013, comed recorded increased revenue of $168 million under eima, primarily due to increased capital investments, increased operating expenses, and higher allowed roe. these amounts exclude the discrete impacts of the 2012 distribution rate case orders discussed separately below. see note 3regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
discrete impacts of the 2012 distribution rate case orders on october 3, 2012, the icc issued its final order related to comeds 2011 formula rate proceeding under eima, which reestablished comeds position on the return on its pension asset, resulting in an increase to revenue in 2013. see note 3regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
transmission revenue during the year ended december 31, 2013, comed recorded increased revenue during the year ended december 31, 2013 of $14 million, primarily due to increased capital investments and higher operating expenses. see note 3regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.

(a)                                          peco evaluates its operating performance using the measures of revenue net of purchased power expense for electric sales and revenue net of fuel expense for gas sales. peco believes revenue net of purchased power expense and revenue net of fuel expense are useful measurements of its performance because they provide information that can be used to evaluate its net revenue from operations. peco has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with gaap. however, revenue net of purchased power expense and revenue net of fuel expense figures are not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report.

net income attributable to common shareholder year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease in net income attributable to common shareholder was driven primarily by an increase in operating and maintenance expense partially offset by an increase in operating revenue net of purchase power and fuel expense and a decrease in income tax expense.
year ended december 31, 2013 compared to year ended december 31, 2012. the increase in net income was driven primarily by lower operating and maintenance expense partially offset by an increase in income taxes.

operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense electric and gas revenue and purchased power and fuel expense are affected by fluctuations in commodity procurement costs. pecos electric supply and natural gas cost rates charged to customers are subject to adjustments at least quarterly that are designed to recover or refund the difference between the actual cost of electric supply and natural gas and the amount included in rates in accordance with the papucs gsa and pgc, respectively. therefore, fluctuations in electric supply and natural gas procurement costs have no impact on electric and gas revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense.
electric and gas revenue and purchased power and fuel expense are also affected by fluctuations in participation in the customer choice program. all peco customers have the choice to purchase electricity and gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers, respectively. the customers choice of suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy and natural gas service. customer choice program activity has no impact on electric and gas revenue net of purchase power and fuel expense. the number of retail customers purchasing energy from a competitive electric generation supplier was 546,900, 531,500, and 496,500 at december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers represented 70%, 68%, and 66% of pecos retail kwh sales for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the number of retail customers purchasing natural gas from a competitive natural gas supplier was 78,400, 66,400, and 52,700 at december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. retail deliveries purchased from competitive natural gas suppliers represented 22%, 19%, and 16% of pecos mmcf sales for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the changes in pecos operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 consisted of the following:

weather the demand for electricity and gas is affected by weather conditions. with respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric and gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as favorable weather conditions because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity and gas. conversely, mild weather reduces demand. operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense was lower due to the impact of unfavorable 2014 summer and fourth quarter weather conditions, partially offset by the impact of favorable first quarter 2014 winter weather conditions in pecos service territory.

heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 30-year period in pecos service territory. the changes in heating and cooling degree days in pecos service territory for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 and normal weather consisted of the following:

volume the increase in operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, primarily reflects the impact of moderate economic and customer growth partially offset by energy efficiency initiatives on customer usages for gas and residential electric and a shift in the volume profile across classes from commercial and industrial classes to residential classes for electric.
pricing the decrease in gas operating revenue net of fuel expense as a result of pricing is primarily attributable to lower overall effective rates due to increased retail gas usage.
regulatory required programs this represents the change in operating revenue collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as smart meter, energy efficiency and the gsa. the riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. the costs of these programs are included in operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and income taxes. refer to the operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.

volume the decrease in electric revenue net of purchased power expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, reflected the impact of energy efficiency initiatives on customer usages as well as a shift in the volume profile across classes from residential classes to commercial and industrial classes, partially offset by the oil refineries returning to full production in 2013 as well as moderate economic growth. the decrease in gas revenue net of fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, primarily reflected a decline in residential use per customer.
pricing the decrease in electric operating revenue net of purchased power expense as a result of pricing is primarily attributable to lower overall effective rates due to increased usage across all major customer classes.
regulatory required programs this represents the change in operating revenue collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for the smart meter, energy efficiency and consumer education programs as well as the administrative costs for the gsa and aeps programs. the riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. the offsetting costs of these programs are included in operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and income taxes. refer to the operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.
gross receipts tax grt is an excise tax on total electric revenue. as a result of decreases in operating revenue compared to 2012, grt decreased. equal and offsetting decreases in grt have been reflected in taxes other than income.
gas distribution tax repair the decrease in gas distribution tax repair reflected the 2012 tax benefit received from prior period gas distribution repairs for the 2011 tax year. there is an equal and offsetting tax benefit in operating revenue, see note 3regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further explanation.
other the decrease in other electric revenue net of purchased power expense compared to the year ended december 31, 2012 reflected a decrease in wholesale transmission revenue earned by peco due to higher peak loads in the previous years.

(a)                                           bge evaluates its operating performance using the measures of revenue net of purchased power expense for electric sales and revenue net of fuel expense for gas sales. bge believes revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense are useful measurements of its performance because they provide information that can be used to evaluate its net revenue from operations. bge has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with gaap. however, revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense figures are not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report.

net income (loss) attributable to common shareholder year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013. net income attributable to common shareholder remained relatively consistent primarily due to an increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense as a result of the december 2013 and 2014 electric and gas distribution rate order issued by the mdpsc offset by increases in operating and maintenance expense and depreciation expense.
year ended december 31, 2013 compared to year ended december 31, 2012. the increase in net income was driven primarily by higher distribution rates as a result of the 2012 rate order issued by mdpsc and decreased revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in 2012 related to the accrual of the residential customer rate credit provided as a condition of the mdpscs approval of exelons merger with constellation. additionally, the increase in net income was also driven by higher operating and maintenance expenses in 2012, primarily related to bges accrual of its portion of the charitable contributions to be provided as a condition of the mdpscs approval of the merger and lower storm restoration costs in 2013.

operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense there are certain drivers to operating revenue that are offset by their impact on purchased power expense and fuel expense, such as commodity procurement costs and programs allowing customers to select a competitive electric or natural gas supplier. electric and gas revenue and purchased power and fuel expense are affected by fluctuations in commodity procurement costs. bges electric and natural gas rates charged to customers are subject to periodic adjustments that are designed to recover or refund the difference between the actual cost of purchased electric power and purchased natural gas and the amount included in rates in accordance with the mdpscs market-based sos and gas commodity programs, respectively.
the number of customers electing to select a competitive electric generation supplier affects electric sos revenue and purchased power expense. the number of customers electing to select a competitive natural gas supplier affects gas cost adjustment revenue and purchased natural gas expense. all bge customers have the choice to purchase energy from a competitive electric generation supplier. this customer choice of electric generation suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenue collected from customers related to sos. the number of retail customers purchasing electricity from a competitive electric generation supplier was 364,000, 399,000 and 362,000 at december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, representing 29%, 32% and 29% of total retail customers, respectively. retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers represented 60%, 61% and 60% of bges retail kwh sales for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the number of retail customers purchasing natural gas from a competitive natural gas supplier was 161,000, 172,000 and 143,000 at december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, representing 25%, 26% and 22% of total retail customers, respectively. retail deliveries purchased from competitive natural gas suppliers represented 53%, 54% and 56% of bges retail mmcf sales for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the changes in bges operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 consisted of the following:

revenue decoupling.
the demand for electricity and gas is affected by weather and usage conditions. the mdpsc has allowed bge to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and gas distribution revenue from all residential customers, commercial electric customers, the majority of large industrial electric customers, and all firm service gas customers to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns per customer on bges electric and gas distribution volumes, thereby recovering a specified dollar amount of distribution revenue per customer, by customer class, regardless of changes in consumption levels. this allows bge to recognize revenue at mdpsc-approved levels per customer, regardless of what bges actual distribution volumes were for a billing period. therefore, while this revenue is affected by customer growth, they will not be affected by actual weather or usage conditions. bge bills or credits impacted customers in subsequent months for the difference between approved revenue levels under revenue decoupling and actual customer billings.

distribution rate increases.
the increase in operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense was primarily due to mdpsc rate orders effective december 13, 2013 and december 15, 2014 approving increases to electric and natural gas distribution rates charged to customers. see note 3regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
commodity margin.
the increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense as a result of commodity margin for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 was primarily due the higher gas margins earned due to extreme cold weather during the first quarter of 2014 under bges market-based rate incentive mechanism. see note 12derivative financial instruments of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
regulatory required programs.
this represents the change in revenue collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for the energy efficiency and demand response programs as well as administrative and commercial and industrial customer bad debt costs for sos. the riders are designed to provide full recovery, as well as a return in certain instances. the costs of these programs are included in operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes. the increase in electric revenue during the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 was due to the recovery of higher energy efficiency program costs.
transmission.
the increase in transmission revenue rates for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 was primarily due to the impact of new transmission rates charged to customers that became effective in june 2014. see note 3regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.

liquidity and capital resources exelons and generations current year activity presented below includes the activity of ceng, from the integration date effective april 1, 2014 through december 31, 2014. all results included throughout the liquidity and capital resources section are presented on a gaap basis.
the registrants operating and capital expenditures requirements are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations as well as funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. the registrants businesses are capital intensive and require considerable capital resources. each registrants access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current overall capital market business conditions, including that of the utility industry in general. if these conditions deteriorate to the extent that the registrants no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, exelon, generation, comed, peco and bge have access to unsecured revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $0.5 billion, $5.3 billion, $1 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. the registrants revolving credit facilities are in place until 2019. in addition, generation has $0.5 billion in bilateral facilities with banks which have various expirations between october 2015 and january 2017. the registrants utilize their credit facilities to support their commercial paper programs, provide for other short-term borrowings and to issue letters of credit. see the credit matters section below for further discussion. the registrants expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs and capital expenditure requirements.
156
the registrants primarily use their capital resources, including cash, to fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and invest in new and existing ventures. the registrants spend a significant amount of cash on capital improvements and construction projects that have a long-term return on investment. additionally, comed, peco and bge operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be delayed or limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time.
see note 13debt and credit agreements of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the registrants debt and credit agreements.
cash flows from operating activities general generations cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of electric energy and energy-related products and services to customers. generations future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by future demand for and market prices of energy and its ability to continue to produce and supply power at competitive costs as well as to obtain collections from customers.
comeds, pecos and bges cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the transmission and distribution of electricity and, in the case of peco and bge, gas distribution services. comeds, pecos and bges distribution services are provided to an established and diverse base of retail customers. comeds, pecos and bges future cash flows may be affected by the economy, weather conditions, future legislative initiatives, future regulatory proceedings with respect to their rates or operations, competitive suppliers, and their ability to achieve operating cost reductions.
see notes 3regulatory matters and 22commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of regulatory and legal proceedings and proposed legislation.
pension and other postretirement benefits management considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under erisa, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the pension protection act of 2006, management of the pension obligation and regulatory implications. on july 6, 2012, president obama signed into law the moving ahead for progress in the twenty-first century act, which contains a pension funding provision that results in lower pension contributions in the near term while increasing the premiums pension plans pay to the pension benefit guaranty corporation. certain provisions of the law were applied in 2012 while others took effect in 2013. on august 8, 2014, this funding relief was extended for five years. the estimated impacts of the law are reflected in the projected pension contributions below.
exelon expects to make qualified pension plan contributions of $447 million to its qualified pension plans in 2015, of which generation, comed, peco and bge expect to contribute $230 million, $138 million, $40 million and $1 million, respectively. exelons and generations expected qualified pension plan contributions above include $36 million related to legacy ceng plans that will be funded by ceng as provided in an employee matters agreement (ema) between exelon and ceng. unlike the qualified pension plans, exelons non-qualified pension plans are not funded. exelon expects to make non-qualified pension plan benefit payments of $15 million in 2015, of which generation, comed, peco and bge will make payments of $6 million, $1 million, $1 million, and $1 million respectively. see note 16retirement benefits of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for the registrants 2014 and 2013 pension contributions.
157
to the extent interest rates decline significantly or the pension plans do not earn the expected asset return rates, annual pension contribution requirements in future years could increase, especially in years 2017 and beyond. additionally, the contributions above could change if exelon changes its pension funding strategy.
unlike qualified pension plans, other postretirement benefit plans are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements and certain plans are not funded. exelons management has historically considered several factors in determining the level of contributions to its funded other postretirement benefit plans, including levels of benefit claims paid and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet regulator expectations and best assure continued recovery). exelon expects to make other postretirement benefit plan contributions, including benefit payments related to unfunded plans, of approximately $37 million in 2015, of which generation, comed, peco, and bge expect to contribute $17 million, $2 million, $0 million, and $17 million, respectively. see note 16retirement benefits of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for the registrants 2014 and 2013 other postretirement benefit contributions.
see the contractual obligations section for managements estimated future pension and other postretirement benefits contributions.
tax matters the registrants future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by the following tax matters:
                                         in the event of a fully successful irs challenge to exelons like-kind exchange position, the potential tax and after-tax interest, exclusive of penalties, that could become currently payable as of december 31, 2014 may be as much as $810 million, of which approximately $310 million would be attributable to comed after consideration of exelons agreement to hold comed harmless, and the balance at exelon. litigation could take several years such that the estimated cash and interest impacts will increase by a material amount.

   exelon, generation, and comed expect to receive tax refunds of approximately $430 million, $190 million, and $260 million, respectively, in 2015. peco expects to make tax payments of approximately $6 million related to irs positions settling in 2015.

   given the current economic environment, state and local governments are facing increasing financial challenges, which may increase the risk of additional income tax levies, property taxes and other taxes.

               on december 19th, 2014, president obama signed h.r. 5771, the tax increase prevention act. the act included an extension of 50% bonus depreciation for 2014. as a result of the 50% bonus depreciation extension, exelon, exgen, comed, peco, and bge are estimated to generate incremental cash of approximately $600 million, $272 million, $217 million, $53 million, and $46 million, respectively. the resulting cash benefits are expected primarily in 2015. the cash generated is an acceleration of tax benefits that registrants would have received over the normal depreciable life of the property. furthermore, the extension of 50% bonus depreciation will result in a decrease to generations domestic production activities deduction, reducing cash tax benefits and increasing income tax expense by approximately $30 million for 2014. comeds 2014 revenue requirement is expected to decrease by approximately $12 million (after-tax) due to the extension of 50% bonus depreciation.

changes in exelons, generations, comeds, pecos and bges cash flows from operations were generally consistent with changes in each registrants respective results of operations, as adjusted by changes in working capital in the normal course of business, except as discussed below. in addition, significant operating cash flow impacts for the registrants for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

                                                  depending upon whether generation is in a net mark-to-market liability or asset position, collateral may be required to be posted with or collected from its counterparties. in addition, the collateral posting and collection requirements differ depending on whether the transactions are on the exchange or in the otc markets. during 2014, 2013 and 2012, generation had net collections (payments) receipts of counterparty cash collateral of $(1,507) million, $162 million and $95 million, respectively. net collections (payments) each year were primarily due to market conditions that resulted in changes to generations net mark-to-market position. in addition, in 2014 the exchanges increased initial margin rates, which required generation to post higher amounts of initial margin.

                  during 2014, 2013 and 2012, generation had net collections (payments) of approximately $38 million, $(36) million and $(114) million, respectively, related to purchases and sales of options. the level of option activity in a given year may vary due to several factors, including changes in market conditions as well as changes in hedging strategy.

comed
                                                 for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, comed had a working capital deficit of $263 million and $508 million, respectively. the working capital deficit is primarily attributable to the increase in short-term borrowings in 2014 and an increase in short-term borrowings and short-term debt due within one year in 2013. cash flows from operating activities are sufficient to meet operating requirements; however, increased capital investment in infrastructure improvements and modernization pursuant to eima, transmission upgrades and expansion may require external debt financing or additional capital contributions from parent.

                                               during 2014, 2013 and 2012, comeds net payables to generation for energy purchases related to its supplier forward contract and icc-approved rfp contracts increased/(decreased) by $5 million, $(16) million and $(15) million, respectively. during 2014, 2013 and 2012 comeds payables to other energy suppliers for energy purchases increased by $27 million, $35 million and $20 million, respectively.

peco
       during 2014, 2013 and 2012, pecos payables to generation for energy purchases increased/(decreased) by $(9) million, $(17) million and $17 million, respectively, and payables to other energy suppliers for energy purchases increased/(decreased) by $10 million, $39 million and $(22) million, respectively.

bge
         during 2014, 2013 and 2012, bges payables to generation for energy purchases increased/(decreased) by $13 million, $(4) million and $23 million, respectively, and payables to other energy suppliers for energy purchases increased/(decreased) by $(7) million, $(12) million and $40 million, respectively.

on january 13, 2015, generation issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes. the senior notes carry an annual interest rate of 2.950%, payable semi-annually, commencing july 15, 2015 and due january 15, 2020. the proceeds of the senior notes will be used to fund the optional redemption of exelons $550 million, 4.550% senior notes due june 15, 2015, expected to occur on february 17, 2015, and for general corporate purposes. in addition to the issuance, exelon terminated floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps that had been designated as cash flow hedges. as the original forecasted transactions were a series of future interest payments over a ten year period, a portion of the anticipated interest payments at this time are probable not to occur. as a result exelon will reclassify $26 million of deferred losses in aoci to other, net in the first quarter of 2015.

credit matters market conditions the registrants fund liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital, energy hedging and other financial commitments through cash flows from continuing operations, public debt offerings, commercial paper markets and large, diversified credit facilities. the credit facilities include $8.5 billion in aggregate total commitments of which $7.3 billion was available as of december 31, 2014, and of which no financial institution has more than 8% of the aggregate commitments for exelon, generation, comed, peco and bge. the registrants had access to the commercial paper market during 2014 to fund their short-term liquidity needs, when necessary. the registrants routinely review the sufficiency of their liquidity position, including appropriate sizing of credit facility commitments, by performing various stress test scenarios, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging levels and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades. the registrants have continued to closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with the credit facilities, including monitoring credit ratings and outlooks, credit default swap levels, capital raising and merger activity. see part i. item 1a. risk factors for further information regarding the effects of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets.
the registrants believe their cash flow from operating activities, access to credit markets and their credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity. if generation lost its investment grade credit rating as of december 31, 2014, it would have been required to provide incremental collateral of $2.4 billion of collateral obligations for derivatives, non-derivatives, normal purchase normal sales contracts and applicable payables and receivables, net of the contractual right of offset under master netting agreements, which is well within its current available credit facility capacities of $4.6 billion. if comed lost its investment grade credit ratings as of december 31, 2014, it would have been required to provide incremental collateral of $14 million, which is well within its current available credit facility capacity of $998 million. if peco lost its investment grade credit rating as of december 31, 2014 it would not be required to provide collateral pursuant to pjms credit policy and could have been required to provide collateral of $36 million related to its natural gas procurement contracts, which, in the aggregate, are well within pecos current available credit facility capacity of $599 million. if bge lost its investment grade credit rating as of december 31, 2014 it would have been required to provide collateral of $2 million pursuant to pjms credit policy and could have been required to provide collateral of $79 million related to its natural gas procurement contracts, which, in the aggregate, are well within bges current available credit facility capacity of $600 million.

investments in nuclear decommissioning trust funds. exelon, generation and ceng maintain trust funds, as required by the nrc, to fund certain costs of decommissioning nuclear plants. the mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to offset inflationary increases in decommissioning costs. generation actively monitors the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically reviews asset allocations in accordance with generations ndt fund investment policy. generations and cengs investment policies establishes limits on the concentration of holdings in any one company and also in any one industry. see note 15asset retirement obligations of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the trust funds, the nrcs minimum funding requirements and related liquidity ramifications.
shelf registration statements. the registrants maintain a combined shelf registration statement unlimited in amount, with the sec. the ability of each registrant to sell securities off the shelf registration statement or to access the private placement markets will depend on a number of factors at the time of the proposed sale, including other required regulatory approvals, as applicable, the current financial condition of the registrant, its securities ratings and market conditions.
regulatory authorizations. the issuance by comed, peco and bge of long-term debt or equity securities requires the prior authorization of the icc, papuc and mdpsc, respectively. comed, peco and bge normally obtain the required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing. as of december 31, 2014, comed had $702 million available in long-term debt refinancing authority and
173
$943 million available in new money long-term debt financing authority from the icc. during the fourth quarter of 2014, comed requested an extension of the expiration date of the refinancing authority from the icc. in january 2015, the icc approved the extension of the refinancing authority, which now expires on february 27, 2017. as of december 31, 2014, peco had $1.1 billion available in long-term debt financing authority from the papuc. as of december 31, 2014, bge had $1.4 billion available in long-term financing authority from mdpsc.

exelons ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the receipt of dividends paid by its operating subsidiaries. the payments of dividends to exelon by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings. the federal power act declares it to be unlawful for any officer or director of any public utility to participate in the making or paying of any dividends of such public utility from any funds properly included in capital account. in addition, under illinois law, comed may not pay any dividend on its stock, unless, among other things, its earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay a dividend after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves, or unless comed has specific authorization from the icc. bge is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by the mdpsc. first, bge is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares through the end of 2014. second, bge is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, bges equity ratio would be below 48% as calculated pursuant to the mdpscs ratemaking precedents or (b) bges senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. finally, bge must notify the mdpsc that it intends to declare a dividend on its common shares at least 30 days before such a dividend is paid. there are no other limitations on bge paying common stock dividends unless: (1) bge elects to defer interest payments on the 6.20% deferrable interest subordinated debentures due 2043, and any deferred interest remains unpaid; or (2) any dividends (and any redemption payments) due on bges preference stock have not been paid. at december 31, 2014, exelon had retained earnings of $10,910 million, including generations undistributed earnings of $3,803 million, comeds retained earnings of $851 million consisting of retained earnings appropriated for future dividends of $2,490 million partially offset by $1,639 million of unappropriated retained deficit, pecos retained earnings of $681 million and bges retained earnings $1,203 million. see note 22commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fund transfer restrictions.

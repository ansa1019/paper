(wcas holdings) collectively, and, after the 2014 reorganization, to paycom software, inc. (software) and its consolidated subsidiaries. all amounts presented, other than share and per share amounts, are presented in thousands unless otherwise noted.
overview we are a leading provider of a comprehensive, cloud-based hcm software solution delivered as saas. we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement. our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions, including talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and hr management applications. our user-friendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees, enabling self-management of their hcm activities in the cloud, which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity.
we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry. we have over 12,000 clients, none of which constituted more than one-half of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014. we stored data for more than 1.6 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended december 31, 2014.
our revenues are primarily generated through our sales force that solicits new clients and our client relations representatives (crrs), who sell new applications to existing clients. we have 34 sales teams located in 23 states and plan to open additional sales offices to further expand our presence in the u.s. market. in recent years, we have opened approximately three to four new sales offices in new cities per year and believe that we can open eight to twelve additional sales offices over the next two years. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we opened five new sales offices, with one sales office located in each of baltimore, indianapolis, philadelphia, portland and silicon valley. to date, during 2015, we opened five new sales offices, with one new sales office located in each of brooklyn, cincinnati, kansas city, nashville and pittsburgh.
our continued growth depends on attracting new clients through geographic expansion, further penetration of our existing markets and the introduction of new applications to our existing client base. we also expect a portion of our growth to generally mirror improvements in the labor market. our principal marketing programs include telemarketing and email campaigns, search engine marketing methods and national radio advertising.
during the last three years, we have developed several new applications. our ability to continue to develop new applications and to improve existing applications will enable us to increase revenues in the future, and the number of our new applications adopted by our clients has been a significant factor in our revenue growth over the last three years.
recent developments follow-on offering on january 21, 2015, we closed our follow-on public offering, whereby 6,422,750 shares of our common stock were sold to the public by certain selling stockholders at a public offering price of $22.50 per share.
39
initial public offering on april 21, 2014, we closed our initial public offering whereby an aggregate of 7,641,750 shares of our common stock were sold to the public (including 4,606,882 shares of common stock issued and sold by us and 3,034,868 shares of common stock sold by certain selling stockholders) at a public offering price of $15.00 per share. we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. the total gross proceeds we received from the offering were $69.1 million. after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us, the aggregate net proceeds we received totaled approximately $64.3 million. we used all of the net proceeds from the offering, together with approximately $3.3 million from existing cash, for the repayment in full of the 10% senior note due 2022 (the 2022 note) issued by us to wcas capital iv and the 14% note due 2017 issued by wcas holdings (the 2017 note).
the 2014 reorganization software and its wholly-owned subsidiary, payroll software merger sub, llc (merger sub) were formed as delaware entities on october 31, 2013 and december 23, 2013, respectively, in anticipation of an initial public offering (ipo) and were wholly-owned subsidiaries of holdings prior to december 31, 2013.
on january 1, 2014, we consummated a reorganization pursuant to which: (i) affiliates of welsh, carson, anderson & stowe, contributed wcas holdings and cp iv blocker, which collectively owned all of the series a preferred units of holdings, to software in exchange for shares of common stock of software, and (ii) the owners of outstanding series b preferred units of holdings contributed their series b preferred units of holdings to software in exchange for shares of common stock of software. immediately after these contributions, merger sub merged with and into holdings with holdings surviving the merger. upon consummation of the merger, the remaining holders of outstanding common and incentive units of holdings received shares of common stock of software for their common and incentive units by operation of delaware law and holdings ownership interest in software was cancelled. outstanding common units, series b preferred units and wcas holdings and cp iv blocker were contributed to software in exchange for, or converted into, 45,708,573 shares of common stock and 8,121,101 shares of restricted stock of software. prior to the reorganization, wcas holdings held series c preferred units of holdings in the amount of $46.2 million and wcas holdings had a note payable to a related party due april 3, 2017, in the amount of $46.2 million. following these transactions, all outstanding series c preferred units of holdings were eliminated in an intercompany transaction between holdings and wcas holdings, and we assumed the 2017 note. following the reorganization, software became a holding company with its principal assets being the series b preferred units of holdings and the outstanding capital stock of wcas holdings and cp iv blocker (collectively, the 2014 reorganization).
softwares acquisition of wcas holdings and holdings in the 2014 reorganization represented transactions under common control and were required to be retrospectively applied to the financial statements for all prior periods when the financial statements were issued for a period that included the date the transactions occurred. this includes a retrospective presentation for all equity related disclosures, including share, per share, and restricted stock disclosures, which have been revised to reflect the effects of the 2014 reorganization. therefore, our consolidated financial statements are presented as if wcas holdings and holdings were our wholly-owned subsidiaries in periods prior to the 2014 reorganization. the acquisition of cp iv blocker was not deemed to be a reorganization under common control and therefore our historical consolidated financial statements include the ownership of a minority equity interest in cp iv blocker, which was eliminated upon the acquisition of cp iv blocker in the 2014 reorganization on january 1, 2014.
trends, opportunities and challenges while we currently derive most of our revenues from payroll processing, we expect an increasing percentage of our recurring revenues to come from our additional hcm applications over time. our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order
40
to access our other applications. as a result of our evolving revenue mix, coupled with the unique client benefits that our solution provides (e.g., enabling our clients to scale the number of hcm applications that they use on an as-needed basis), we are presented with a variety of opportunities, challenges and risks.
we generate revenues from (i) fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or (ii) fixed amounts charged per billing period. we do not require clients to enter into long-term contractual commitments with us. our billing period varies by client based on when they pay their employees, which is either weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly.
we do not have a traditional subscription-based revenue model and do not enter into long-term contractual commitments with our clients. we believe that the traditional subscription model hinders the buying decision by requiring clients to make significant commitments at inception, as well as at the end of each subscription term. by allowing clients to discontinue the use of our solution with 30 days notice, our team of trained specialists must focus on providing the best client service. in contrast, a long-term contract often forces a client to continue using a product that may not entirely fit its needs or, in some cases, incur expensive termination fees. because of our sales model and personalized service, we have maintained high client satisfaction, as evidenced by an average annual revenue retention rate of 91% from existing clients for the three years ended december 31, 2014.
for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our gross margin was approximately 82%, 81% and 79%, respectively. we expect changes in our revenue mix to gradually improve gross margin over time as sales of applications other than payroll processing increase as a percentage of revenues, given that our current gross margin for our other hcm applications is higher than our gross margin for payroll processing. we expect that our total gross margin will gradually improve over time as (i) we add additional clients, (ii) our existing clients deploy additional hcm applications and (iii) we reduce our costs of revenues and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues.
growing our business has also resulted in, and will continue to result in, substantial investment in sales professionals, operating expenses, systems development and programming costs and general and administrative expenses, which has and will continue to increase our expenses. we intend to obtain new clients by (i) continuing to expand our presence in metropolitan areas where we currently have an existing sales office through adding sales teams or offices and increasing the number of our sales professionals and (ii) opening sales offices in new metropolitan areas. our ability to increase revenues and improve operating results depends on our ability to add new clients.
as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of our applications, the average size of our clients has also grown significantly. based on our total revenues, we have grown at an approximately 38% cagr from january 1, 2009 through december 31, 2014. because we charge our clients on a per employee basis for certain services we provide, any increase or decrease in the number of employees that our clients have will have a positive or negative impact on our results of operations. our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients. we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of potential clients and to increase our revenue per client, with limited incremental cost to us.
throughout our history, we have built strong relationships with our clients. as the hcm needs of our clients evolve, we believe that we are well-positioned to gain additional share of the hcm spending of our clients, and we believe this opportunity is significant. to be successful, we must continue to demonstrate the operational and economic benefits of our solution, as well as effectively hire, train, motivate and retain qualified personnel and executive officers.

key metrics in addition to the u.s. gaap metrics that we regularly monitor, we also monitor the following metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance and identify trends affecting our business:
year ended december 31,
2014                    2013                     2012
(dollars in thousands)
key performance indicators:
clients                                                12,775                   10,792                   9,233
clients (based on parent company grouping)              7,945                    6,788                   5,904
sales teams                                                31                       26                      23
annualized new recurring revenue                      $59,629                  $42,063                 $27,686
revenue retention rate                                     91    %                  91    %                 91   %
                        clients. when we calculate the number of clients at period end, we treat client accounts with separate taxpayer identification numbers as separate clients, which often separates client accounts that are affiliated with the same parent organization. we track the number of our clients to provide an accurate gauge of the size of our business. unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to clients throughout this annual report on form 10-k refer to this metric.

                         clients (based on parent company grouping). when we calculate the number of clients based on parent company grouping at period end, we combine client accounts that have identified the same person(s) as their decision-maker regardless of whether the client accounts have separate taxpayer identification numbers, which often combines client accounts that are affiliated with the same parent organization. we track the number of our clients based on parent company grouping to provide an alternate measure of the size of our business and clients.

   sales teams. we monitor our sales professionals by the number of sales teams at period end and each team is comprised of approximately six to nine sales professionals. certain larger metropolitan areas can support more than one sales team. we believe that the number of sales teams is an indicator of potential revenues for future periods.

                          annualized new recurring revenue. while we do not enter into long-term contractual commitments with our clients, we monitor annualized new recurring revenue as we believe it is an indicator of potential revenues for future periods. annualized new recurring revenue is an estimate based on the annualized amount of the first full month of revenues attributable to new clients that were added or existing clients that purchased additional applications during the period presented. annualized new recurring revenue only includes revenues from these clients who have used our solution for at least one month during the period. since annualized new recurring revenue is only recorded after a client uses our solution for one month, it includes revenue that has been recognized in historical periods.

   revenue retention rate. our average annual revenue retention rate tracks the percentage of revenue that we retain from our existing clients. we monitor this metric because it is an indicator of client satisfaction and revenues for future periods.

components of results of operations sources of revenues revenues are comprised of recurring revenues, and implementation and other revenues. recurring revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered. implementation and other revenues includes implementation revenues that are recorded as deferred revenues and recognized over the life of the client which is estimated to be ten years and other revenues which are recognized upon shipment of time clocks. implementation and other revenue comprised approximately 1.8% of our total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014. we expect our revenues to increase as we introduce new applications, expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients. as a percentage of total revenues, we expect our mix of recurring revenues, and implementation and other revenues to remain relatively constant.
42
recurring. recurring revenues include fees for our talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for delivery of client payroll checks and reports. these revenues are derived from: (i) fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or (ii) fixed amounts charged per billing period. because recurring revenues are based in part on fees for use of our applications and the delivery of checks and reports that are levied on a per-employee basis, our recurring revenues increase as our clients hire more employees.
implementation and other. implementation and other revenues are comprised of implementation fees for the deployment of our solution and other revenue from sales of time clocks as part of our time and attendance services. non-refundable implementation fees which are charged to new clients are generated at inception for a new client and upon the addition of certain incremental applications for existing clients. these fees range from 10% to 30% of the annualized value of the transaction.
expenses cost of revenues. cost of revenues consists of expenses related to hosting and supporting our applications, hardware costs, systems support and technology and depreciation of certain owned computer equipment. these costs include employee-related expenses for client support personnel, bank charges for processing ach transactions, certain implementation expenses, along with delivery charges and paper costs. they also include our cost for time clocks sold and ongoing technology and support costs related to our systems. depreciation of owned computer equipment is allocated based upon an estimate of assets used to host and support our applications. we expect our cost of revenues to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in new applications and expand our client base, although we expect our overall cost of revenues to gradually decrease as a percentage of total revenues over time.
administrative expenses. administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization. sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff, commissions, bonuses, marketing expenses and other related costs. research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our development staff, net of capitalized software costs for internally developed software. we expect to grow our research and development efforts as we continue to broaden our payroll and hr solution offerings and extend our technological solutions by investing in the development of new applications and introducing them to new and existing clients. general and administrative expenses include employee-related expenses for finance and accounting, legal, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses. depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation of owned computer equipment allocated based upon an estimate of assets used to support the selling, general and administrative functions, as well as amortization of intangible assets. we expect our administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, investor relations, and other costs associated with being a public company, although our administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues.
loss on repayment of debt during 2014, we wrote off $4.1 million related to the discount associated with the repayment of certain related party debt.
interest expense interest expense includes interest on our corporate headquarters and related party debt. the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 is primarily due to our use of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and existing cash for the repayment in full, of the 2022 note and the 2017 note in april 2014.
other income, net other income, net includes the gain or loss on the sale of fixed assets, interest on funds held for clients that are earned primarily on funds that are collected in advance of either the applicable due date for payroll tax
43
submissions or the applicable disbursement date for employee payment services and change in fair value of the derivative liability relating to the related party debt. we typically invest funds held for clients in money market accounts and certificates of deposit until they are paid to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. these collections from clients are typically disbursed from one to 30 days after receipt, with some funds being held for up to 120 days. we expect that interest on funds held for clients in other income will increase as we increase our cash and cash equivalents and increase our funds held from clients as we introduce new applications, expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients.

quarterly revenues trends excluding changes in quarterly revenues due to seasonal factors, our quarterly revenues generally increased sequentially for the periods presented due to a combination of factors, including the addition of clients in mature sales offices (those offices that have been open for at least 24 months), the addition of new clients in more recently opened sales offices, the introduction and sale of additional applications to our existing clients and the growth in the number of employees of our clients. in addition, the annual processing of payroll forms were subject to a one-time price increase in conjunction with increased access and review functionality associated with these forms in 2012, which resulted in an increase of less than 1% of recurring revenues for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
there are also seasonal factors that affect our revenues. recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w-2 and form 1099, or payroll form revenues. because these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year, first quarter revenue and margins are generally higher than subsequent quarters.
quarterly expenses trends selling, general and administrative expenses are generally higher in the fourth and first quarters as sales representatives achieve sales goals throughout the year, resulting in higher commission rates. these sales goals reset annually on february 1.
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents which totaled $25.1 million and $13.4 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. our cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of deposit accounts and money market funds. we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months.
we have historically financed our operations from cash flows generated from operations, cash from the sale of debt and equity securities and borrowings under our consolidated loans. since inception, we have raised $125.1 million of equity capital, $64.3 million of which was the net proceeds raised in our initial public offering that closed in april 2014. we have also incurred indebtedness to finance the expansion of our corporate headquarters, which was completed in june 2014, as well as other previously constructed facilities, and incurred related party debt as part of a corporate reorganization that occurred in april 2012 (the april 2012 corporate reorganization), and the 2014 reorganization. we may be required to incur additional indebtedness within the next twelve months to finance the further expansion of our corporate headquarters. as of december 31, 2014, our only outstanding indebtedness consisted of the 2021 consolidated loan, which is discussed in more detail below.
2021 consolidated loan. as of december 31, 2014, we had a term note under the 2021 consolidated loan with an outstanding principal amount of $27.0 million due to kirkpatrick bank that matures on may 30, 2021. under the 2021 consolidated loan, interest is payable monthly and accrues at a fixed rate of 4.75% per annum. the 2021 consolidated loan is secured by a mortgage covering our headquarters buildings and certain personal property relating to our headquarters buildings.
we are required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants under the 2021 consolidated loan, including maintaining a debt coverage ratio of ebitda to indebtedness (defined as current maturities of long-term debt, interest expense and distributions) greater than 1.5 to 1.0. as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the 2021 consolidated loan.
pursuant to the terms of the 2021 consolidated loan, we may not, subject to certain exceptions, until amounts under the 2021 consolidated loan are repaid: (i) create any mortgages or liens, (ii) make any loans, advances or extensions of credit with any affiliate or enter into any other transaction with any affiliate, (iii) lease any mortgaged property, (iv) make any distributions to members as long as an event of default exists, (v) make
49
any material change in methods of accounting, (vi) enter into any sale and leaseback arrangement, (vii) amend, modify, restate, cancel or terminate our organizational documents, (viii) sell, transfer or convey any mortgaged property or (ix) incur funded outside debt.
an event of default under the 2021 consolidated loan includes, among other events, (i) failure to pay principal or interest when due, (ii) breaches of certain covenants, (iii) any failure to meet the required financial covenants and (iv) an institution of a bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership.
cash flow analysis our cash flows from operating activities have historically been significantly impacted by profitability, implementation revenue received but deferred, and our investment in sales and marketing to drive growth. our ability to meet future liquidity needs will be driven by our operating performance and the extent of continued investment in our operations. failure to generate sufficient revenue and related cash flows or to raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives.
as part of our payroll and payroll tax filing services, we collect funds for federal, state and local employment taxes from our clients which we remit to the appropriate tax agencies. we invest these funds in short-term certificates of deposit and money market funds from which we earn interest income during the period between their receipt and disbursement.
as our business grows, we expect our capital expenditures and our investment activity to continue to increase. depending on certain growth opportunities, we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing, acquisitions, technology and services. actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our future revenues, cash from operating activities and the level of expenditures in all areas of our business.

financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014, cash flows provided by financing activities was $208.5 million. the cash flows provided by financing activities resulted primarily from an increase in client funds obligations of $204.8 million related to the collection of client taxes, gross proceeds from our initial public offering of $62.8 million and proceeds from the issuance of debt of $6.5 million, which were partially offset by payments on long-term debt of $65.7 million.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, cash flows provided by financing activities was $131.4 million. the cash flows provided by financing activities resulted primarily from an increase in client funds obligations of $131.5 million related to the collection of client taxes and advances received from long-term debt of $7.0 million, which were partially offset by distributions paid to members of $5.4 million.
contractual obligations our principal commitments primarily consist of long-term debt and leases for office space. we disclose our long-term debt to a related party in note 5 and our commitments and contingencies in note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.

we may continue to lease additional office space to support our growth. in addition, many of our existing lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. our future operating lease obligations include payments due during any renewal period provided for in the lease where the lease imposes a penalty for failure to renew.
the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.

off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2014, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
critical accounting policies and estimates our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, we continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results may materially differ from these estimates made by management under different assumptions and conditions.
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates, and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position, are described below. accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
revenue recognition our total revenues are comprised of recurring revenues, and implementation and other revenues. we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies when all of the following criteria have been met:
   there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;

   the service has been or is being provided to the customer;

   collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and

   the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.

recurring revenues are derived primarily from our talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and hr management applications. these services are rendered during each clients payroll period with the agreed-upon fee being charged and collected as part of the clients payroll. revenues are recognized at time of billing of each clients payroll period. collectability is reasonably assured as the fees are collected through ach as part of the clients payroll cycle or through direct wire transfer, which minimizes the default risk. our implementation and other revenues represent non- refundable conversion fees which are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client set-up and revenues from sale of time clocks as part of our employee time and attendance services. because these conversion fees and sale of time clocks relate to our recurring revenues, we have evaluated such arrangements under the accounting guidance that governs multiple element arrangements.
for arrangements with multiple elements, we evaluate whether each element represents a separate unit of accounting. in order to treat deliverables in a multiple element arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. if the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately and revenue is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered. if one or more of the deliverables does not have standalone value upon delivery, the deliverables that do not have standalone value are generally combined with the final deliverable within the arrangement and treated as a single unit of accounting.
for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we determined that there was no standalone value associated with the upfront conversion fees as they did not have value to our clients on a standalone basis nor were they offered as an individual service; therefore, the conversion fees were deferred and are recognized
52
ratably over the estimated life of our clients, based on our historical client attrition rate, which we estimate to be ten years. revenues from the sale of time clocks are recognized when they are delivered.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized, but we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually, or earlier if, at the reporting unit level, an indicator of impairment arises. the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. if impairment exists, a write-down to fair value (normally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows) is recorded. our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. we have selected june 30 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date and determined there was no impairment as of june 30, 2014. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, there were no indicators of impairment. intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. we have determined that there is no impairment of long-lived assets for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
restricted stock and incentive units given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock and incentive units prior to our initial public offering, and in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants (the aicpa), audit and accounting practice aid series: valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation (the aicpa practice guide), our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our restricted stock and incentive units, including:
   valuation analyses performed by an unrelated third party specialist (including the application of appropriate valuation techniques and inputs);

   characteristics and specific terms of the shares as noted in the equity grant agreements;

   value of the shares as determined by the absence of a liquidation value on the date of grant, the ability to participate in our future profits, growth and appreciation and the lack of an exercise price for the shares;

   lack of marketability of our common stock;

   our actual operating and financial performance;

   our state of development;

   revenue and expense projection;

   likelihood of achieving a liquidating event;

   market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; and

   overall u.s. and global economic and capital market conditions.

53
our simulation model requires various subjective assumptions as inputs, including expected life, volatility, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield. the assumptions used in the simulation model represent our best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment as follows:
   risk-free interest rate  we base the risk-free interest rate used in the monte carlo simulation model on the implied yield available on 5 year u.s. treasury securities with a remaining term equivalent to that of the restricted stock or incentive units as of the valuation date.

                       volatility  we determine the volatility factor based on the historical volatilities of comparable guideline companies. to determine the comparable guideline companies, we consider cloud-based application providers and select those that are similar to us in nature of services provided. we intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until information regarding the volatility of our own pricing changes, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.

   expected term the expected term represents the period that our restricted stock or incentive units are expected to be outstanding. we determined the expected term assumption based on the vesting terms and contractual terms of the restricted stock.

   expected dividend yieldwe have not paid and do not expect to pay dividends in the future and therefore an expected dividend yield of 0% was applied. our directors will determine if and when dividends will be declared and paid in the future based on our financial position at the relevant time.

in addition to assumptions used in the simulation model, we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. our forfeiture estimate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures. we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover, and other factors.

we granted the following management incentive units (the management incentive units), between october 1, 2012 and the date of the 2014 reorganization (in thousands, except per unit amounts):
number of          fair value incentive     per unit (1)(2)
units granted grant date november 19, 2012               200              $11.16
january 7, 2013                 610               $7.92
january 17, 2013              3,000               $8.08
march 28, 2013                  700              $14.04
april 17, 2013                3,000              $14.13
october 14, 2013             18,493              $16.46

(1)   because our management incentive units did not have an exercise price, the intrinsic value of the unit equaled the fair value.

(2)   represents the weighted average fair value per unit, incorporating both time-based and market-based vesting conditions.

there were no other equity instruments granted during the period from october 1, 2012 to the date of the 2014 reorganization. during 2012, management incentive units were issued with a strike price that was based on a $400.0 million company enterprise value. during 2013, management incentive units were issued with a strike price that was based on a $400.0 million and $550.0 million company enterprise value. we also issued incentive units to our chief executive officer (the ceo incentive units), with a strike price that was based on a $550.0 million company enterprise value during 2012. these strike prices are a vesting condition, by which the underlying incentive units did not vest unless the value of our company met or exceeded the specified level. our incentive units did not have an exercise price.
we believe that there is no single event that caused the change in the fair value of our incentive units between the grant dates, but rather a combination of factors described below for the significant difference noted in between certain grants as follow:
   increase in value between the value at the grant date and the value at the initial public offering as a result of improved operating results; and

   increase in the probability assumption of an initial public offering scenario as we approached the estimated initial public offering date.

in connection with the 2014 reorganization, the incentive units we issued as part of the 2009 incentive units plan (the 2009 incentive units), were converted into shares of restricted stock. upon the sale of common stock in the initial public offering, approximately 217,378 shares of restricted common stock that were granted to replace the 2009 incentive units automatically vested.
in connection with the 2014 reorganization, incentive units in holdings were converted into shares of common stock and/or restricted stock. vested incentive units were converted to shares of common stock and restricted stock at various conversion ratios that ranged from approximately 1:0.2 to 1:24. unvested incentive units were converted to shares of restricted stock at various conversion ratios that ranged from 1:24 to 1:47. the conversion to shares of common stock or restricted stock was determined based on the underlying conditions of the pre-conversion incentive units and reflected any pre-existing vesting conditions. this conversion resulted in the issuance of 1,148,520 and 8,121,101 shares of common stock and restricted stock, respectively, on january 1, 2014. the shares of restricted stock are subject to either time-based or performance-based vesting conditions. the fasb accounting standards codification (asc), section 718-20-53-3 indicates that if the terms and conditions of an existing equity incentive compensation plan are to be modified, then an entity should record
55
additional compensation cost for any incremental value associated with the modification. the incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess of the fair value of the modified awards over the fair value of the original awards immediately before its terms are modified. based on the terms of restricted stock, we concluded that there was a modification of the existing equity incentive units. based upon a valuation by an independent third party, management determined there was no additional compensation cost created in the conversion, as the value of the incentive units given up was less than the value of the restricted stock received. as such, there was no additional compensation recorded.
shares of restricted stock that were issued in connection with the 2014 reorganization that were subject to time-based vesting conditions retained substantially the same time-based vesting conditions as the respective tranche of incentive units from which they were converted. for additional information concerning these vesting conditions, see executive compensationnarrative discussion regarding summary compensation tableequity incentive units and restricted stock awards. the following table shows the vesting periods for the outstanding shares of restricted stock subject to time-based vesting conditions that were issued in connection with the 2014 reorganization:

2015                       575,288
2016                       575,426

total                     1,826,761
shares of restricted stock that were issued in connection with the 2014 reorganization that were subject to performance-based vesting conditions vested 50% upon the company reaching a total enterprise value of $1.4 billion on december 1, 2014. the remaining 50% will vest upon the company reaching a total enterprise value of $1.8 billion, provided that the person is employed by us on that date. for additional information concerning these vesting conditions, see executive compensationnarrative discussion regarding summary compensation tableequity incentive units and restricted stock awards. if the companys stock price remains at or near its current price, the company believes that the shares of restricted stock that are subject to the performance-based vesting condition of a total enterprise value of $1.8 billion will vest during the first quarter of 2015.

derivative instruments in april 2012, we entered into the 2022 note with wcas capital iv, a related party. the note contained certain prepayment features related to mandatory redemption upon a liquidation event. as of december 31, 2012, we had identified the prepayment feature of the note as a derivative instrument which is required to be bifurcated and separately accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. refer to note 7 of our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 for further discussion. the following are the significant inputs used to value the derivative instrument as of december 31, 2013 and 2012:

there were no derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31, 2014.
recent accounting pronouncements in february 2013, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued authoritative guidance which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci). the update requires that an entity present either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements, the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of aoci based on its source and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. the amendment is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on after december 15, 2012. we adopted this new guidance as of the year ended december 31, 2013. this guidance has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in february 2013, the fasb issued authoritative guidance, which added new disclosure requirements to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangement for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting date and disclose the arrangements and the total outstanding amount of obligation for all joint parties. these disclosures are in addition to existing related party disclosure requirements. we adopted this new guidance as of the year ended december 31, 2013. this guidance has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in july 2013, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires entities to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. we adopted this new guidance for the year ended december 31, 2013, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which included a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. the new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. accordingly, the standard is effective for us on january 1, 2017. we are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
in june 2014, the fasb issued authoritative guidance for share-based payments which requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. as such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair
57
value of the award. this update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. the new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2015. accordingly, the standard is effective for us on january 1, 2016. we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
non-gaap financial measures we use ebitda, adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income, as supplemental measures to review and assess our performance and planning purposes. we define: (i) ebitda as net income (loss), plus interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization, (ii) adjusted ebitda as net income (loss), plus interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, net loss on early extinguishment of debt and certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations and (iii) non-gaap net income as unaudited pro forma net income (loss) plus tax adjusted stock-based compensation expense, tax adjusted net loss on early extinguishment of debt and certain tax adjusted transaction expenses that are not core to our operations. ebitda, adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income are metrics that we believe are useful to investors in evaluating our performance and facilitating comparison with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-gaap financial measures to supplement results under u.s. gaap.
ebitda, adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income are not measures of financial performance under u.s. gaap, and should not be considered a substitute for net income (loss) or pro forma net income (loss), as applicable, which we consider to be the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures. ebitda, adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider ebitda, adjusted ebitda or non-gaap net income in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, unaudited pro forma net income (loss) or other consolidated statements of income data prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. ebitda, adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income may not be comparable to similar titled measures of other companies and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do.
the following tables reconcile net income (loss) to ebitda and adjusted ebitda and unaudited pro forma net income (loss) to non-gaap net income (loss) (in thousands except per share amounts):

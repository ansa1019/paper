introduction on june 28, 2013, twenty-first century fox, inc. and its subsidiaries (formerly known as news corporation) (together, "twenty-first century fox" or the "company") completed the separation of its business into two independent publicly traded companies (the "separation") by distributing to its stockholders all of the outstanding shares of the new news corporation ("news corp"). the company retained its interests in a global portfolio of media and entertainment assets spanning six continents. news corp holds the company's former businesses including newspapers, information services and integrated marketing services, digital real estate services, book publishing, digital education and sports programming and pay-tv distribution in australia. the company completed the separation by distributing to its stockholders one share of news corp class a common stock for every four shares of the company's class a common stock held on june 21, 2013, and one share of news corp class b common stock for every four shares of the company's class b common stock held on june 21, 2013. the company's stockholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares. following the separation, the company does not beneficially own any shares of news corp class a common stock or news corp class b common stock.
effective june 28, 2013, the separation qualified for discontinued operations treatment in accordance with the requirements of financial accounting standards board's ("fasb") accounting standards codification ("asc") 205-20, "discontinued operations" ("asc 205-20"), and accordingly the company deconsolidated news corp's balance sheet as of june 30, 2013, and presented its results for the fiscal year ended june 30, ("fiscal") 2013 and fiscal 2012 as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. the company has reflected the separation as a distribution on the consolidated statement of equity as of june 30, 2013.  the footnotes to the financial statements have also been revised accordingly for fiscal 2013 and 2012. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations describes the company giving effect to the separation, except where stated otherwise.

overview of the company's business the company is a diversified global media and entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in the following five segments:
·   cable network programming, which principally consists of the production and licensing of programming distributed through cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators and telecommunication companies primarily in the u.s., latin america, europe and asia.

·   television, which principally consists of the broadcasting of network programming in the u.s. and the operation of 28 full power broadcast television stations, including 10 duopolies, in the u.s. (of these stations, 18 are affiliated with the fox broadcasting company ("fox") and 10 are affiliated with master distribution service, inc. ("mynetworktv")).

·   filmed entertainment, which principally consists of the production and acquisition of live-action and animated motion pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all entertainment media worldwide, and the production and licensing of television programming worldwide.

·   direct broadcast satellite television, which consists of the distribution of programming services via satellite, cable and broadband directly to subscribers in italy, germany and austria.

·   other, corporate and eliminations, which principally consists of corporate overhead and eliminations and other businesses.

cable network programming and television the company's cable networks, which target various demographics, derive a majority of their revenues from monthly affiliate fees received from multi-channel video programming distributors ("mvpds") based on the number of their subscribers. affiliate fee revenues are net of the amortization of cable distribution investments (capitalized fees paid to u.s. mvpds to typically facilitate the carriage of a domestic cable network). the company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period. cable television and direct broadcast satellite are currently the predominant means of distribution of the company's program services in the u.s. internationally, distribution technology varies region by region.
the television operations derive revenues primarily from the sale of advertising, and to a lesser extent, retransmission consent revenue. adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising may affect revenues.
u.s. law governing retransmission consent revenue provides a mechanism for the television stations owned by the company to seek and obtain payment from mvpds who carry the company's broadcast signals. retransmission consent revenue consists of per subscriber-based compensatory fees paid to the company by mvpds that distribute the signals of the company's owned and operated television stations. the company also receives compensation
40
from independently-owned television stations that are affiliated with fox and receive retransmission consent fees from mvpds for their signals.
the most significant operating expenses of the cable network programming segment and the television segment are the acquisition and production expenses related to programming and the expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the cable network or broadcaster. other expenses include promotional expenses related to improving the market visibility and awareness of the cable network or broadcaster and its programming. additional expenses include sales commissions paid to the in-house advertising sales force, as well as salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses.
the profitability of u.s. national sports contracts and international sports rights agreements is based on the company's best estimates at june 30, 2014 of attributable revenues and costs; such estimates may change in the future and such changes may be significant. should revenues decline from estimates applied at june 30, 2014, additional amortization of rights may be recorded. should revenues improve as compared to estimated revenues, the company may have improved results related to the contract, which may be recognized over the remaining contract term.
filmed entertainment the filmed entertainment segment derives revenue from the production and distribution of live-action and animated motion pictures and television series. in general, motion pictures produced or acquired for distribution by the company are exhibited in u.s. and foreign theaters, followed by home entertainment, including sale and rental of dvds and blu-rays, licensing through digital distribution platforms, premium subscription television, network television and basic cable and syndicated television exploitation. television series initially produced for the networks and first-run syndication are generally licensed to domestic and international markets concurrently and subsequently released in seasonal dvd and blu-ray box sets and made available via digital distribution platforms. more successful series are later syndicated in domestic markets. the length of the revenue cycle for television series will vary depending on the number of seasons a series remains in active production and, therefore, may cause fluctuations in operating results. license fees received for television exhibition (including international and u.s. premium television and basic cable television) are recorded as revenue in the period that licensed films or programs are available for such exhibition, which may cause substantial fluctuations in operating results.
the revenues and operating results of the filmed entertainment segment are significantly affected by the timing of the company's theatrical and home entertainment releases, the number of its original and returning television series that are aired by television networks and cable channels and the number of its television series in off-network syndication. theatrical and home entertainment release dates are determined by several factors, including timing of vacation and holiday periods and competition in the marketplace. the distribution windows for the release of motion pictures theatrically and in various home entertainment products and services (including subscription rentals, rental kiosks and digital distribution platforms), have been compressing and may continue to change in the future. a further reduction in timing between theatrical and home entertainment releases could adversely affect the revenues and operating results of this segment.
the company enters into arrangements with third parties to co-produce many of its theatrical productions. these arrangements, which are referred to as co-financing arrangements, take various forms. the parties to these arrangements include studio and non-studio entities, both domestic and foreign. in several of these agreements, other parties control certain distribution rights. the filmed entertainment segment records the amounts received for the sale of an economic interest as a reduction of the cost of the film, as the investor assumes full risk for that portion of the film asset acquired in these transactions. the substance of these arrangements is that the third-party investors own an interest in the film and, therefore, receive a participation based on the respective third-party investor's interest in the profits or losses incurred on the film. consistent with the requirements of fasb asc 926, "entertainment-films" ("asc 926"), the estimate of a third-party investor's interest in profits or losses on the film is based on total estimated ultimate revenues.
operating costs incurred by the filmed entertainment segment include: exploitation costs, primarily theatrical prints and advertising and home entertainment marketing and manufacturing costs; amortization of capitalized
41
production, overhead and interest costs; and participations and talent residuals. selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead.
direct broadcast satellite television the direct broadcast satellite television ("dbs") segment derives revenues principally from subscriber fees. the company believes that the quality and variety of programming, audio and interactive programming including personal video recorders, quality of picture including high definition channels, access to services, customer service and price are the key elements for gaining and maintaining market share.
the dbs segment's most significant operating expenses are those related to the acquisition of entertainment, movie and sports programming and subscribers and the expenses related to operating the technical facilities. operating expenses related to sports programming are generally recognized over the course of the related sport season, which may cause fluctuations in the operating results of this segment.
the continued challenging economic environment in europe has contributed to a reduction in consumer spending and has posed challenges for subscriber retention and growth. if this trend continues, it could have a material effect on the operating results of the dbs segment.
other, corporate and eliminations the other, corporate and eliminations segment consists primarily of corporate overhead and eliminations and other businesses.
other business developments cable network programming in september 2013, the company acquired the 22% interest it did not already own in latin america pay television ("laptv"), an entity that distributes premium and basic television channels in latin america, for approximately $75 million in cash. as a result of this transaction, the company now owns 100% of laptv.

filmed entertainment in may 2014, the company and certain funds managed by apollo global management ("apollo") entered into a preliminary agreement, subject to a number of conditions, to form a joint venture to which the company will contribute its interests in the shine group. the joint venture is expected to be comprised of the shine group, endemol, and the core media group and will be jointly owned and managed by the company and the funds managed by apollo. if the

overview - the company's revenues increased 15% for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to increases in subscription, affiliate fees, content and advertising revenues. the increase in subscription revenues was primarily due to the effect of the consolidation of sky deutschland from january 2013. the increase in affiliate fees for fiscal 2014 was principally attributable to higher average rates per subscriber across most cable channels, including the conversion and related launch of new channels, and the acquisition of majority interests in the yes network, fox sports asia (formerly espn star sports) and eredivisie media & marketing cv ("emm") (collectively the "acquisitions"). also contributing to the increase in affiliate fees for fiscal 2014 were higher retransmission consent revenues. the increase in content revenues was primarily due to higher sales of television and motion picture productions. the increase in advertising revenue for fiscal 2014 was principally attributable to revenues arising from the broadcast of super bowl xlviii in february 2014, growth at the cable network programming segment including the conversion and related launch of new channels, fox sports 1, star sports networks and fxx, and the acquisitions. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies (non-euro) resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $285 million for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, partially offset by the effect of the weakening of the u.s. dollar against the euro of approximately $225 million.
operating expenses increased 21% for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the increases at the dbs, cable network programming and filmed entertainment segments of approximately $1,490 million, $1,070 million and $975 million, respectively. the operating expense increase at the dbs segment was primarily
44
due to the effect of the consolidation of sky deutschland from january 2013. the increase at the cable network programming segment for fiscal 2014 was primarily related to higher programming costs, the continued investments in the new channels, fox sports 1, star sports networks and fxx, and the acquisitions. the increase at the filmed entertainment segment was primarily related to an increase in production amortization and participation costs related to the television programming and motion picture production businesses and higher theatrical marketing costs as a result of the increase in the number of significant theatrical releases in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the increases at the cable network programming and dbs segments of approximately $85 million and $75 million, respectively. the increase at the cable network programming segment for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to higher personnel costs and the effect of the acquisitions. the increase at the dbs segment was primarily due to the effect of the consolidation of sky deutschland from january 2013.
depreciation and amortization, including the amortization of acquired identifiable intangible assets, increased 43% for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the consolidation of sky deutschland and the acquisition of the majority interest in the yes network.
equity earnings of affiliates - equity earnings of affiliates decreased $33 million for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, due to the decreases at the dbs equity affiliates primarily related to lower results and gains at bskyb, partially offset by the absence of equity losses due to the consolidation of sky deutschland from january 2013. the gains from the company's participation in bskyb's share repurchase program declined by approximately $170 million during fiscal 2014. partially offsetting the net decreases at the dbs equity affiliates were increases at the other equity affiliates, led by hulu llc ("hulu"), and the cable channel equity affiliates. hulu's results benefited from higher subscription and advertising revenues and the effect of the charges recorded during fiscal 2013 for the redemption of providence equity partners' equity interest in october 2012. the increase at the cable channel equity affiliates was led by higher contributions from the yes network, which was an affiliate until the date of its acquisition.

income tax expense - the company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 25% for fiscal 2014 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 7% rate reduction from our foreign operations due to tax credits and deductions arising from a corporate restructuring as well as the effect of income attributable to non-controlling interests. the balance of the difference in the rate was primarily attributable to the company's ability to utilize the domestic production activities deduction and the recognition of a deferred tax asset for additional tax basis.
in connection with the pending disposition of sky italia and sky deutschland pursuant to sale agreements with bskyb, the company plans to use most of its u.s. capital loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits carryforwards to offset a substantial amount of the gain which is likely to be recognized. a benefit equal to the loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards utilized is expected to be recognized at that time, as a valuation allowance is currently recorded against these assets. the agreements are subject to regulatory approvals, the approval of bskyb stockholders and customary closing conditions.
the company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 19% for fiscal 2013 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 7% rate reduction as a result of adjustments to valuation allowances for the utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards in connection with the nds group limited ("nds") transaction and the consolidation of sky deutschland, which, in accordance with asc 740, "income taxes" ("asc 740"), reduced income tax expense due to the removal of a historical valuation allowance. in addition, there is a 4% rate reduction resulting from the sale of interests in subsidiaries and the non-taxable gain on the consolidation of fox sports asia, as well as a 2% rate reduction from our foreign operations due to tax credits and deductions arising from a corporate restructuring. the effect of foreign operations was lower than in fiscal 2012 as a result of the substantial increase in income from continuing operations.
46
income from discontinued operations, net of tax - for fiscal 2014, the company recorded income from discontinued operations of $729 million as compared to income of $277 million in fiscal 2013. the change was primarily due to the absence of income from discontinued operations as a result of the separation in fiscal 2013 and the recognition in fiscal 2014 of a tax refund paid to news corp and then transferred to the company in accordance with the tax sharing and indemnification agreement. a subsidiary of news corp, prior to the separation, had filed for refunds to claim certain losses in a foreign jurisdiction. during fiscal 2014, the foreign jurisdiction notified news corp that it had accepted its claims and refunded the taxes plus interest to news corp.
net income - net income decreased for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the absence of the gain recorded upon the consolidation of sky deutschland in fiscal 2013 and the absence of the gain related to the sale of nds, partially offset by an increase in total segment oibda (as defined in "segment analysis").
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests - net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of the noncontrolling interests' share of sky deutschland's net losses on its consolidation.

overview - the company's revenues increased 10% for fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, as a result of higher affiliate fee, subscription and content revenues. the increase in affiliate fee revenues was attributable to
47
higher average rates per subscriber across most channels, the consolidations of fox sports asia and fox pan american sports llc, doing business as fox sports latin america ("fsla"), the acquisition of emm and higher retransmission consent revenues. the increase in subscription revenue was due to the consolidation of sky deutschland in january 2013, partially offset by lower subscription revenue at sky italia. the higher content revenue was due to an increase in worldwide theatrical revenues. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $370 million for fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012.
operating expenses increased 12% for fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to increased operating expenses at the dbs, cable network programming and filmed entertainment segments of $850 million, $770 million and $210 million, respectively. the increase at the dbs segment was primarily the result of the consolidation of sky deutschland and higher programming costs while the increase at the cable network programming segment was primarily due to the consolidations of fox sports asia and fsla, the acquisition of emm, new cricket contracts in india and the launch of new channels. the increase at the filmed entertainment segment was primarily due to higher theatrical marketing costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8% for fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to increased expenses at the cable network programming, filmed entertainment and television segments of approximately $160 million, $70 million and $36 million, respectively. the increase at the cable network programming segment was primarily due to the consolidations of fox sports asia and fsla, the acquisition of emm and the launch of new channels. the increase at the filmed entertainment and television segments was primarily due to higher personnel costs and higher legal expenses for cases relating to the protection of the company's intellectual property rights.
depreciation and amortization increased 12% for fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to consolidations of sky deutschland, fox sports asia and fsla and the acquisition of emm.
impairment charges - during fiscal 2013 and 2012, the company recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $35 million and $201 million, respectively, related to the sale of a business in its digital media group in fiscal 2013.
equity earnings of affiliates - equity earnings of affiliates increased $19 million for fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to improved results at the dbs equity affiliates of $168 million partially offset by losses at the other equity affiliates. the improvement in the dbs equity affiliates' results was driven by the absence of approximately $85 million in losses as a result of the consolidation of sky deutschland and improved results of approximately $75 million from bskyb. these improvements were partially offset by lower contributions of approximately $70 million from hulu, as a result of the redemption of providence equity partners' equity interest in october 2012 and the absence of approximately $55 million in equity earnings resulting from the sale of the company's investment in nds in july 2012.

income tax expense - the company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 19% for fiscal 2013 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 7% rate reduction as a result of adjustments to valuation allowances for the utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards in connection with the nds transaction and the consolidation of sky deutschland, which, in accordance with asc 740, reduced income tax expense due to the removal of a historical valuation allowance. in addition, there was a 4% rate reduction resulting from the sale of interests in subsidiaries and the non-taxable gain on the consolidation of fox sports asia, as well as a 2% rate reduction from the company's foreign operations due to tax credits and deductions arising from a corporate restructuring. the effect of foreign operations was lower than in fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of the substantial increase in income from continuing operations.
the company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 25% for fiscal 2012 was lower than the u.s. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 6% rate reduction from the company's foreign operations due to tax credits and deductions arising from a corporate restructuring as well as a 4% rate reduction resulting from the sale of interests in subsidiaries and the non-taxable gain on the consolidation of fsla.
income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax - for fiscal 2013, the company recorded income from discontinued operations of $277 million as compared to a loss of $1,997 million in fiscal 2012. this improvement was due to lower restructuring and impairment charges and a non-taxable gain from news corp's revaluation of its previously held equity interest in foxtel, as a result of the acquisition of consolidated media holdings ltd. these improvements were partially offset by transaction costs related to the separation.
net income - net income increased for fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the gain on the sky deutschland transaction as well as the gains on the sale of the company's investment in nds and improved results from continuing and discontinued operations.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests - net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased for fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher results at the company's majority-
49
owned businesses and the issuances of additional noncontrolling interests at the company's cable businesses. these increases were partially offset by the noncontrolling interests' share of sky deutschland's net losses.
segment analysis the company's operating segments have been determined in accordance with the company's internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. the company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment oibda. due to the integrated nature of the operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses.
segment oibda is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. segment oibda does not include: amortization of cable distribution investments, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, equity earnings of affiliates, interest expense, net, interest income, other, net, income tax expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. management believes that segment oibda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the company's business segments because it is the primary measure used by the company's chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources within the company's businesses.
management believes that information about total segment oibda assists all users of the company's consolidated financial statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the company's portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. total segment oibda provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the company's business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors' data, although historical results, including segment oibda and total segment oibda, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).
total segment oibda is a non-gaap measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). in addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the company's financial performance.

cable network programming (39% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2014 and 2013)
for fiscal 2014, revenues at the cable network programming segment increased $1,392 million, or 13%, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to higher affiliate fee and advertising revenues as shown below:
fiscal 2014
% increase

affiliate fees        15        %
advertising            9        %
other                  3        %
total                 13        %
the 13% increase in total cable network programming segment revenue is net of a 2% decline due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies, and the absence of distributor credits recorded in fiscal 2013.
domestic affiliate fee revenues increased 14% for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. over 55% of the increase during fiscal 2014 was due to higher average rates per subscriber across most channels led by the rsns, fox news channel ("fox news"), fx networks, llc ("fx"), which includes fxx, and the conversion and related launch of fox sports 1. in addition, over 15% of the increase in affiliate fee revenues during fiscal 2014 was due to growth in subscribers, led by the conversion and related launch of new channels. the balance of the growth was primarily attributable to the impact resulting from the acquisition of the majority interest in the yes network in february 2014 and the absence of distributor allowances resulting from the 2012-2013 national hockey league ("nhl") lockout in fiscal 2013. domestic advertising revenues increased 8% for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. approximately 65% of the increase in domestic advertising revenues is primarily due to higher pricing and volume, at fx, which includes fxx, at the national geographic channels and the conversion and related launch of fox sports 1. the balance of the growth in domestic advertising revenue was primarily attributable to the contributions from the yes network and additional nhl games in fiscal 2014.
for fiscal 2014, international affiliate fee revenues increased 19% and international advertising revenues increased 9% as compared to fiscal 2013. for fiscal 2014, the increase in international affiliate fee revenues was substantially led by local currency growth, primarily at fox international channels ("fic"), as a result of higher pricing in latin america and increase in subscribers in latin america and asia. the increase in international advertising revenues in fiscal 2014 was significantly driven by local currency growth at fic and star due to higher pricing and volume in latin america, higher pricing at star's entertainment channels and star sports' broadcast of the asia cup and international cricket council cricket tournaments. also contributing to the increase in international affiliate fee and advertising revenues for fiscal 2014 was the conversion and related launch of star sports, the consolidation of fox sports asia and the acquisition of emm. the international affiliate fee and advertising revenue increases in local currencies, for fiscal 2014, were partially offset by the adverse impact of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies, primarily in india and latin america.
for fiscal 2014, segment oibda at the cable network programming segment increased $230 million, or 6%, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher expenses of $1,162 million, or 17% as compared to fiscal 2013. operating expenses increased by approximately $1,070 million for fiscal 2014. approximately one-half of this increase was due to the continued investment in new channels and the acquisitions. the remaining increase was primarily due to higher programming costs at fic, the rsns and fx. these increases were due to a combination of continued investment in new shows and sports programming and additional nhl games broadcast by the rsns in fiscal 2014. selling, general and administrative expenses increased for fiscal 2014 by approximately $85 million primarily due to higher personnel costs and the effect of the acquisitions. the increase in segment oibda for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, is net of a decrease of approximately $130 million due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies.
52
television (17% and 18% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively)
for fiscal 2014, revenues at the television segment increased $436 million, or 9%, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to higher advertising revenues and affiliate fees. advertising revenues increased 5% for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the revenues arising from the broadcast of super bowl xlviii in february 2014 of approximately $350 million and from higher pricing and ratings driven by the strong national football league ("nfl") regular and post season and the major league baseball ("mlb") post season, including the two additional mlb world series games in fiscal 2014. these increases were partially offset by the effect of lower primetime ratings, led by declines at american idol and x-factor, and lower political advertising due to the absence of the benefit in fiscal 2013 from the 2012 elections. affiliate fee revenues increased as a result of higher retransmission consent revenues for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.
for fiscal 2014, segment oibda at the television segment increased $27 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above partially offset by higher expenses of $409 million, or 10%, as compared to fiscal 2013. operating expenses increased by approximately $365 million for fiscal 2014. this increase was primarily due to the broadcast of super bowl xlviii in february 2014 and higher primetime programming costs led by increased licensing fees for returning series and higher programming costs related to the new season of 24 and gang related. also contributing to the increase were higher advertising and marketing costs to support the fall 2013 launch of new television series and higher sports programming costs primarily related to the two additional mlb world series games in fiscal 2014. selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $45 million for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to higher legal fees and costs associated with the television station transactions.
filmed entertainment (30% and 31% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively)
for fiscal 2014, revenues at the filmed entertainment segment increased $1,037 million, or 12%, as compared to fiscal 2013. the increase in revenues was primarily due to higher worldwide theatrical revenues, an increase in network and syndication revenues, led by modern family, and higher digital distribution revenues from the licensing of television productions. the increase in digital distribution revenue was primarily due to the licensing of online and mobile rights for various productions led by the licensing of series to amazon, which includes 24 and the americans. fiscal 2014 revenues included the worldwide theatrical success of x-men: days of future past and rio 2 and the worldwide theatrical, home entertainment and pay television performance of the wolverine and the heat, as compared to fiscal 2013 which included the worldwide theatrical and home entertainment success of ice age: continental drift, life of pi and taken 2 and the worldwide theatrical success of the croods.
for fiscal 2014, segment oibda at the filmed entertainment segment increased $50 million, or 4%, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above partially offset by higher expenses of $987 million, or 13%, as compared to fiscal 2013. operating expenses increased by approximately $975 million for fiscal 2014 primarily due to increases in production amortization and participation costs, largely due to the mix of theatrical films released in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, as well as increases related to television productions. also contributing to the operating expense increase was higher theatrical marketing costs as a result of the increase in the number of significant theatrical releases in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, including x-men: days of future past, rio 2, the secret life of walter mitty and dreamworks animation's mr. peabody and sherman and how to train your dragon 2.
direct broadcast satellite television (19% and 16% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively)
for fiscal 2014, revenues at the dbs segment increased $1,591 million, or 36%, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of revenues resulting from the consolidation of sky deutschland from january 2013 and greater contribution from sky italia primarily due to the broadcast of the 2014 international federation of football association ("fifa") world cup. the weakening of the u.s. dollar against the euro also contributed to a revenue increase of approximately $225 million for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.
53
sky italia's ending and average subscriber base of 4.7 million subscribers for fiscal 2014 decreased from 4.8 million subscribers in fiscal 2013. the total churn for fiscal 2014 was approximately 495,000 subscribers, as compared to a churn of approximately 684,000 subscribers in fiscal 2013. sky deutschland's ending subscriber base for fiscal 2014 was 3.8 million subscribers as a result of a net increase of approximately 360,000 subscribers during fiscal 2014. the total churn for fiscal 2014 was approximately 368,000 subscribers on an average subscriber base of 3.6 million subscribers as compared to a churn of approximately 179,000 subscribers on an average subscriber base of 3.4 million subscribers in fiscal 2013. subscriber churn for the period represents the number of subscribers whose service was disconnected during the period.
sky italia's average revenue per subscriber ("arpu") of approximately €43 per month for fiscal 2014 increased from approximately €42 per month in fiscal 2013, primarily due to higher pricing and upgrades in services. sky deutschland's arpu of approximately €35 per month for fiscal 2014 increased from approximately €34 per month in fiscal 2013, primarily due to upgrades in services. arpu is calculated by dividing total subscriber-related revenues for the period by the average subscribers for the period and dividing that amount by the number of months in the period. subscriber-related revenues are comprised of total subscription revenue, pay-per-view revenue and equipment rental revenue, if any, for the period. average subscribers are calculated for the respective periods by adding the beginning and ending subscribers for the period and dividing by two.
sky italia's subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber ("sac") of approximately €410 for fiscal 2014 increased from approximately €350 for fiscal 2013, primarily due to increased advertising and marketing costs on a per subscriber basis. sac is calculated by dividing total subscriber acquisition costs for a period by the number of gross subscribers added during the period. subscriber acquisition costs include the cost of the commissions paid to retailers and other distributors, the cost of equipment sold directly to subscribers and the costs related to installation and acquisition advertising net of any upfront activation fee. sac excludes the value of equipment capitalized under equipment lease programs, as well as payments and the value of returned equipment related to disconnected lease program subscribers.
for fiscal 2014, segment oibda at the dbs segment increased $27 million, or 7%, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above partially offset by higher expenses of $1,564 million, or 39%, as compared to fiscal 2013. operating expenses increased by approximately $1,490 million for fiscal 2014 primarily due to the full year inclusion of sky deutschland. also contributing to the operating expense increase were higher programming costs associated with the bundesliga soccer rights and the broadcasts of the sochi olympics, the fifa world cup and formula one, partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the broadcast of the london olympics in fiscal 2013. selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $75 million for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of sky deutschland. for fiscal 2014, the weakening of the u.s. dollar against the euro contributed approximately $20 million to increase segment oibda, as compared to fiscal 2013.
other, corporate and eliminations ((5)% and (4)% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively)
for fiscal 2014, the change in revenues at the other, corporate and eliminations segment, as compared to fiscal 2013, was primarily due to intercompany transactions and the absence of revenues from the company's digital media business, as it was disposed in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
for fiscal 2014, the improvement in the segment oibda results at the other, corporate and eliminations segment, as compared to fiscal 2013, was primarily due to lower compensation expenses and legal and professional fees.

cable network programming (39% and 37% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively)
for fiscal 2013, revenues at the cable network programming segment increased $1,557 million, or 17%, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher net affiliate fee revenues of approximately $1,075 million and advertising revenues of approximately $300 million, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations at fic and star. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $175 million for fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012.
domestic affiliate fee revenues increased 12% for fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher average rates per subscriber across most channels, additional subscribers due to the acquisition of an rsn in ohio and the launch of fox sports san diego. for fiscal 2013, domestic advertising revenues increased 6%, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher pricing and ratings at fx and the national geographic channels, which comprised 80% of the growth.
for fiscal 2013, international affiliate fee revenues increased 35% and international advertising revenues increased 20%, as compared to fiscal 2012. over half of the international affiliate fee revenues' increase and three-quarters of the international cable channels' advertising revenues' growth were due to local currency growth at the non-sports channels at fic and star. the balance of the growth was attributable to the international sports channels, including fsla, fox sports asia, emm, the launch of new channels and the new contracts to broadcast cricket matches in india. these increases in international advertising revenues and international affiliate fee revenues were partially offset by an 8% and 7% adverse impact from the strengthened u.s. dollar, respectively.
for fiscal 2013, segment oibda at the cable network programming segment increased $628 million, or 18%, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by expense increases of $929 million. this increase was due to higher operating expenses primarily due to increased programming costs from the inclusion of expenses from fox sports asia, fsla and emm and the new cricket contracts in india which accounted for 60% of this increase. the launch of new channels, as noted above, and higher programming costs accounted for 30% of this increase. the higher programming cost was a result of new shows launched on fx and new contracts for mixed martial arts matches, u.s. college football games and higher national basketball association ("nba") costs due to the nba lockout in fiscal 2012, partially offset by reduced nhl costs resulting from the nhl lockout in fiscal 2013. the balance of the increase was due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses primarily related to higher personnel costs as a result of the expansion of the business. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a segment oibda decrease of approximately $80 million for fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012.
television (18% and 19% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively)
for fiscal 2013, revenues at the television segment increased $57 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher affiliate fee revenues resulting from higher retransmission consent revenues which more than doubled in comparison to fiscal 2012, partially offset by decreased advertising revenues of approximately $190 million. the decrease in advertising revenues was due to lower primetime ratings driven by declines at x-factor and american idol.
for fiscal 2013, segment oibda at the television segment increased $64 million, or 8%, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above and lower operating expenses of $43 million due to reduced entertainment programming costs as a result of the final season of house in fiscal 2012 and lower licensing fees for returning series. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $36 million primarily due to higher legal expenses for cases relating to the protection of the company's intellectual property rights.
filmed entertainment (31% and 33% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively)
for fiscal 2013, revenues at the filmed entertainment segment increased $279 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher worldwide theatrical revenues of approximately $420 million. these revenue
56
increases were partially offset by decreased home entertainment revenues of approximately $135 million. fiscal 2013 included the worldwide theatrical and home entertainment success of ice age: continental drift, life of pi and taken 2, the worldwide theatrical success of the croods, a product of the company's dreamworks animation distribution deal, and the worldwide home entertainment and pay television performance of prometheus, as compared to fiscal 2012 which included the successful worldwide theatrical and home entertainment release of rise of the planet of the apes and alvin and the chipmunks: chipwrecked, the worldwide theatrical success of prometheus and the home entertainment and pay television performances of rio and x-men: first class.
for fiscal 2013, segment oibda at the filmed entertainment segment was consistent with fiscal 2012, as the revenue increases were offset by higher expenses. operating expenses increased by approximately $210 million primarily due to higher theatrical marketing costs associated with the theatrical releases noted above as well as the initial pre-launch costs for wolverine, and the distribution of turbo for dreamworks animation. selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $70 million primarily due to higher personnel costs.
direct broadcast satellite television (16% and 15% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively)
for fiscal 2013, revenues at the dbs segment increased $699 million, or 19%, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the inclusion of $900 million in revenues resulting from the consolidation of sky deutschland, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $200 million in revenues at sky italia. the decrease at sky italia was primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro, which resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $120 million as compared to fiscal 2012 and the balance of the change was primarily due to a decrease in activation, advertising and subscription revenues.
sky italia had a net decrease of approximately 146,000 subscribers during fiscal 2013, which decreased sky italia's total subscriber base to 4.8 million at june 30, 2013, reflecting the continued challenging economic environment in italy. the total churn for fiscal 2013 was approximately 684,000 subscribers on an average subscriber base of 4.8 million, as compared to churn of approximately 641,000 subscribers on an average subscriber base of 4.9 million in fiscal 2012. during fiscal 2013, sky deutschland had a net increase of approximately 90,000 subscribers, which increased sky deutschland's total subscriber base to 3.5 million. the total churn for fiscal 2013 was approximately 179,000 subscribers on an average subscriber base of 3.4 million, as compared to churn of approximately 159,000 subscribers on an average subscriber base of 3.1 million in fiscal 2012.
sky italia's arpu of approximately €42 per month in fiscal 2013 remained relatively consistent with the corresponding period of fiscal 2012. sky deutschland's arpu of approximately €34 per month in fiscal 2013 increased from approximately €32 per month reported in fiscal 2012, primarily due to a higher incremental increase in total subscriber-related revenues.
sky italia's sac of approximately €350 in fiscal 2013 decreased from approximately €400 in fiscal 2012, due to lower commissions and installation costs on a per subscriber basis. the lower commissions were a result of a change in the sales channel mix and the lower installation costs were a result of fewer customers taking up the full subscription offer.
for fiscal 2013, segment oibda at the dbs segment decreased $164 million, or 29%, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher programming expenses of approximately $150 million at sky italia associated with the broadcast of the olympics and expanded uefa champions and europa league, and formula one coverage. this decrease in segment oibda was partially offset by the consolidation of sky deutschland. during fiscal 2013, the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro resulted in a segment oibda decrease of approximately $12 million as compared to fiscal 2012.
other, corporate and eliminations ((4)% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2013 and 2012)
the other, corporate and eliminations segment contains the company's corporate entities and intercompany eliminations and other businesses. for fiscal 2013 revenues related to business activities at the other, corporate and
57
eliminations segment decreased as compared to fiscal 2012, due to the exclusion of revenues from the disposition of the company's digital media businesses in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
for fiscal 2013, segment oibda related to business activities at the other, corporate and eliminations segment decreased, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher compensation expense.
liquidity and capital resources current financial condition the company's principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds. the company also has a five-year unused $2 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in may 2017, and has access to various film co-production alternatives to supplement its cash flows. in addition, the company has access to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions. as of june 30, 2014, the company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the revolving credit facility, and it does not anticipate any violation of such covenants. the company's internally generated funds are highly dependent upon the state of the advertising markets and public acceptance of its film and television productions.
as of june 30, 2014, the company's consolidated assets included $5.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1.1 billion was held by the company's foreign subsidiaries. the company earns income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign jurisdictions. the company does not currently intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. should the company require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by or available to its domestic operations, the company could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions which may result in higher effective tax rates and higher cash paid for income taxes for the company.
the principal uses of cash that affect the company's liquidity position include the following: investments in the production and distribution of new motion pictures and television programs; the acquisition of and payments under programming rights for entertainment and sports programming; operational expenditures including employee costs; capital expenditures; interest expenses; income tax payments; investments in associated entities; dividends; acquisitions; debt repayments; and stock repurchases.
the company entered into a separation and distribution agreement with news corp ("separation and distribution agreement") pursuant to which the company agreed to provide a cash contribution to news corp, immediately prior to the separation, so that as of the separation, news corp would have approximately $2.6 billion of cash on hand. accordingly, immediately prior to the separation, the company distributed approximately $2.4 billion to news corp, which was comprised of $1.6 billion in cash funding and approximately $800 million that was held by news corp's subsidiaries immediately prior to the separation. the company made a final cash distribution of $217 million in september 2013, pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement.
in july 2014, the company participated in bskyb's equity offering by purchasing approximately $900 million of additional shares in bskyb and maintained the company's 39% ownership interest. bskyb's share repurchase program was suspended in july 2014. (see note 3 - acquisitions, disposals and other transactions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox)
in addition to the acquisitions, sales and possible acquisitions disclosed elsewhere, the company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the company's securities or the assumption of additional indebtedness.

net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2014 was relatively consistent with net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013. during fiscal 2014, higher receipts, primarily related to increases in affiliate fees and subscription collections, were offset by higher programming spending, production spending and participation payments.

for the years ended june 30,            2014                2013

net cash used in financing activities       $(3,776     )       $(4,571     )
the change in net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, was primarily due to the absence of the $2.6 billion cash contribution, in fiscal 2013, to news corp as part of the separation partially offset by an increase in cash used for share repurchases of approximately $1.7 billion.
in august 2014, the company announced that the board approved an additional $6 billion authorization to the company's stock repurchase program for the repurchase of class a common stock. the company intends to complete this stock repurchase program by august 2015.
the program may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time.

based on the number of shares outstanding as of june 30, 2014 and a similar dividend rate as in fiscal 2014, the total aggregate cash dividends expected to be paid to stockholders in fiscal 2015 is approximately $550 million.

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, was primarily due to higher receipts at the cable network programming segment driven by higher segment oibda of $628 million, lower pension contributions of $112 million and higher cash distributions received from affiliates of $43 million. this increase was partially offset by higher payments for film and television production costs in the filmed entertainment segment, higher sports program rights payments in the television segment, higher program
59
rights payments in the dbs segment principally from the consolidation of sky deutschland and higher cash taxes paid of $164 million.

the increase in net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, was primarily due to the sale of the 49% investment in nds for approximately $1.9 billion in total consideration, partially offset by additional cash utilized for acquisitions, property, plant and equipment and the purchase of a 49% equity interest in the yes network.

("jpmorgan chase") and citibank, n.a. as co-administrative agents, jpmorgan chase as designated agent and bank of america, n.a. as syndication agent. the credit agreement provides a $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a sub-limit of $400 million (or its equivalent in euros) available for the issuance of letters of credit and a maturity date of may 2017. under the credit agreement, the company may request an increase in the amount of the credit facility up to a maximum amount of $2.5 billion and the company may request that the maturity date be extended for up to two additional one-year periods. borrowings are issuable in u.s. dollars only, while letters of credit are issuable in u.s. dollars or euros. the material terms of the agreement include the requirement that the company maintain specific leverage ratios and limitations on secured indebtedness. fees under the credit agreement will be based on the company's long-term senior unsecured non-credit enhanced debt ratings. given the current debt ratings, 21cfa pays a facility fee of 0.125% and an initial drawn cost of libor plus 1.125%.
commitments and guarantees the company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements ("firm commitments") to make future payments. these firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations. the following table summarizes the company's material firm commitments as of june 30, 2014.

other commitments and contractual obligations primarily includes obligations relating to distribution agreements, marketing agreements and television rating services.
hulu indemnity see note 16 - commitments and contingencies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox.
pension and other postretirement benefits and unrecognized tax benefits the table excludes the company's pension, other postretirement benefits ("opeb") obligations and the gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing. the company made contributions of $100 million and $95 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. the majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, interest rates and statutory requirements. assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company's expected plan returns in fiscal 2015 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the company would not be required to make any material contributions to its u.s. pension plans for the immediate future. required pension plan contributions for the next fiscal year are not expected to be material but the company may make voluntary contributions in future periods. payments due to participants under the company's pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts. payments due under the company's opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the company's pension plans. the company does not expect its net opeb payments to be material in fiscal 2015. (see note 17 - pension and other postretirement benefits to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox for further discussion of the company's pension and opeb plans)
contingencies other than as disclosed in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox, the company is party to several other purchase and sale arrangements which become exercisable by the company or the counter-party to the agreement. none of these arrangements that become or are exercisable in the next twelve months are material. equity purchase arrangements that are exercisable by the counter-party to the agreement, and that are outside the sole control of the company, are accounted for in accordance with asc 480-10-s99-3a, "distinguishing liabilities from equity." accordingly, the fair values of such equity purchase arrangements are classified in redeemable noncontrolling interests.
u.s. regulators and governmental authorities continue to conduct investigations initiated in 2011 with respect to the u.k. newspaper matters. the company is cooperating with these investigations. it is not possible at this time to estimate the liability, if any, of the company relating to these investigations.
in connection with the separation, the company and news corp agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that the company will indemnify news corp, on an after-tax basis, for payments made after the separation arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to the u.k. newspaper matters, as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the related criminal matters, other than fees, expenses and costs relating to employees who are not (i) directors, officers or certain designated employees or (ii) with respect to civil matters, co-defendants with news corp (the "indemnity") (see note 16 - commitments and contingencies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox). if additional information becomes available and as payments are made, the company will update the liability provision for the indemnity. any changes to the liability provision for the indemnity in the future will impact the results of operations for that period.
the company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when the company determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. once established, accruals are adjusted from
63
time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. the amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. it is possible that these proceedings and any adverse resolution thereof, including any fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlements which might be incurred by the company in connection with the various proceedings could damage the company's reputation, impair its ability to conduct its business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.
the company's operations are subject to tax in various domestic and international jurisdictions and as a matter of course, the company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity.
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company's financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the company's board of directors. for the company's summary of significant accounting policies, see note 2 - summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox.
use of estimates see note 2 - summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox.
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fees are fixed or determinable, the product or service has been delivered and collectability is reasonably assured. the company considers the terms of each arrangement to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.
cable network programming, television and direct broadcast satellite television advertising revenue is recognized as the commercials are aired, net of agency commissions. subscriber fees received from mvpds for cable network programming and television are recognized as affiliate fee revenue in the period services are provided. direct broadcast satellite television subscription and pay-per-view revenues are recognized when programming is broadcast to subscribers, while fees for equipment rental are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
the company classifies the amortization of cable distribution investments (capitalized fees paid to mvpds to facilitate carriage of a cable network) against affiliate fee revenue in accordance with asc 605-50, "revenue recognition-customer payments and incentives." the company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
filmed entertainment revenues from distribution of motion pictures and television programming are recognized in accordance with asc 926. revenues from the theatrical distribution of motion pictures are recognized as they are exhibited, and revenues from home entertainment sales, net of a reserve for estimated returns, are recognized on the date that dvd and blu-ray units are made widely available for sale by retailers or when made available for viewing via digital distribution platforms and all company-imposed restrictions on the sale or availability have expired. revenues from television distribution are recognized when the motion picture or television program is made available to the licensee for broadcast.
64
management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each film on the historical performance of similar films, incorporating factors such as the past box office record of the lead actors and actresses, the genre of the film, pre-release market research (including test market screenings) and the expected number of theaters in which the film will be released. management updates such estimates based on information available on the actual results of each film through its life cycle.
license agreements for the broadcast of motion pictures and television programming in the broadcast network, syndicated television and cable television markets are routinely entered into in advance of their available date for broadcast. cash received and amounts billed in connection with such contractual rights for which revenue is not yet recognizable is classified as deferred revenue. because deferred revenue generally relates to contracts for the licensing of theatrical and television productions which have already been produced, the recognition of revenue for such completed product is principally only dependent upon the commencement of the availability period for broadcast under the terms of the related licensing agreement.
the company earns and recognizes revenues as a distributor on behalf of third parties. in such cases, determining whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on management's assessment of whether the company acts as the principal or agent in the transaction. to the extent the company acts as the principal in a transaction, revenues are reported on a gross basis. determining whether the company acts as principal or agent in a transaction involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of whether we have the substantial risks and rewards of ownership under the terms of an arrangement.
filmed entertainment costs and programming rights accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with asc 926, which requires management's judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program or its license period. these judgments are used to determine the amortization of capitalized filmed entertainment and television programming costs, the expensing of participation and residual costs associated with revenues earned and any fair value adjustments.
in accordance with asc 926, the company amortizes filmed entertainment and television programming costs using the individual-film-forecast method. under the individual-film-forecast method, such programming costs are amortized for each film or television program in the ratio that current period actual revenue for such title bears to management's estimated ultimate revenue as of the beginning of the current fiscal year to be recognized over approximately a six year period or operating profits to be realized from all media and markets for such title. management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each film on factors such as historical performance of similar films, the star power of the lead actors and actresses and, once released, actual results of each film. for each television program, management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue on the performance of the television programming in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell additional episodes of the program and the past performance of similar television programs. management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a title-by-title basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the asset to fair value.
original cable programming is amortized on an accelerated basis. management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a contract basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the asset to fair value.
the costs of national sports contracts at fox and the national sports channels are charged to expense and allocated to segments based on the ratio of each current period's attributable revenue for each contract to the estimated total remaining attributable revenue for each contract. estimates can change and accordingly, are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted as necessary. such changes in the future could be material.
the costs of local and regional sports contracts for a specified number of events are amortized on an event-by-event basis, while costs for local and regional sports contracts for a specified season are amortized over the season on a straight-line basis.
65
goodwill and intangible assets the company has a significant amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, film and television libraries, federal communications commission ("fcc") licenses, mvpd affiliate agreements and relationships and trademarks and other copyrighted products. intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill is recorded as the difference between the consideration paid to acquire an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment. the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income.
the company accounts for its business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles. amounts recorded as goodwill are assigned to one or more reporting units. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method.
carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with asc 350 "intangibles-goodwill and other." the company's impairment review is based on, among other methods, a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgments. the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired.
the company uses direct valuation methods to value identifiable intangibles for acquisition accounting and impairment testing. the direct valuation method used for fcc licenses requires, among other inputs, the use of published industry data that are based on subjective judgments about future advertising revenues in the markets where the company owns television stations. this method also involves the use of management's judgment in estimating an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risk of a market participant in the u.s. broadcast industry. the resulting fair values for fcc licenses are sensitive to these long-term assumptions and any variations to such assumptions could result in an impairment to existing carrying values in future periods and such impairment could be material.
during fiscal 2014, the company determined that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of twenty-first century fox as of june 30, 2014 were not impaired. the company determined there are no reporting units with goodwill considered to be at risk and will continue to monitor its goodwill and intangible assets for possible future impairment.
see note 10 - goodwill and other intangible assets to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox for further discussion on the annual impairment review.
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. the company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the company's tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties under asc 740.
66
the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. in making this assessment, management analyzes future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, the company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income.
employee costs the measurement and recognition of costs of the company's various pension and opebs require the use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation and other actuarial assumptions.
the company participates in and/or sponsors various pension, savings and postretirement benefit plans covering a significant number of its employees and retirees. the major pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are closed to new participants (with the exception of groups covered by collective bargaining agreements). in connection with the separation, the company entered into an employee matters agreement (as defined in note 4 - discontinued operations to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox) with news corp which provides that employees of news corp no longer participate in benefit plans sponsored or maintained by the company as of the separation date. upon separation, the company's plans transferred assets and obligations to news corp resulting in a net decrease in sponsored pension and postretirement plan obligations of $558 million. additionally, as a result of the separation, deferred items of approximately $500 million were transferred to news corp.
for financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations, an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality. the company considers current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, in making these assumptions. in developing the expected long-term rate of return, the company considered the pension portfolio's past average rate of returns, and future return expectations of the various asset classes. the expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 48% equity securities, 37% fixed-income securities and 15% in cash and other investments. the mortality assumption reflects the experience of recent studies which indicate improvements in mortality. the assumption selected by the company assumes there will be continuous improvement in future mortality.
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on the company's annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year. the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. the rate was determined by matching the company's expected benefit payments for the primary plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred high-quality corporate bonds.
67
the key assumptions used in developing the company's fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 net periodic pension expense for its plans consist of the following:
2014                                              2013                  2012

(a)   due to the separation in fiscal 2013, information presented for fiscal 2014 and 2013 does not have any expected returns or actual returns related to discontinued operations. fiscal 2012 includes expected returns and actual returns from discontinued operations of $82 million and $39 million, respectively.

the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the u.s. and europe as of the measurement date. the company will utilize a weighted average discount rate of 4.5% in calculating the fiscal 2015 net periodic pension expense for its plans. the company will use a weighted average long-term rate of return of 7.0% for fiscal 2015 based principally on a combination of asset mix and historical experience of actual plan returns. the accumulated net pre-tax losses on the company's pension plans at june 30, 2014 were $794 million which increased from approximately $625 million at june 30, 2013. this increase of $169 million was primarily due to the change in the discount rate partially offset by higher asset performance. the accumulated pre-tax net losses at june 30, 2014 were primarily the result of changes in discount rates and deferred asset losses. lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company's deferred losses and also increase subsequent-year pension expense. higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company's accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequent-year pension expense. these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with asc 715, "compensation-retirement benefits." unrecognized losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans' projected benefit obligation ("pbo") are recognized over the average future service of the plan participants or average future life of the plan participants.
the company made contributions of $100 million, $95 million, and $255 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively of which $100 million, $95 million, and $207 million related to continuing operations, respectively. the majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans which were impacted by the economic conditions noted above. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and interest rate movements. assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the company's expected plan returns in fiscal 2015 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the company would not be required to make any material statutory contributions to its primary u.s. pension plans for the immediate future. the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve funded status.
68
changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in the company's expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company's pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant:
changes in assumption                            impact on annual         impact on pbo pension expense

0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate   increase $10 million   increase $112 million
0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate   decrease $10 million   decrease $105 million
0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets   increase $5 million    -

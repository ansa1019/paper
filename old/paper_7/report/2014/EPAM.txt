for 2014, we reported results of operations consistent with the continued execution of our strategy. in 2014, our operating expenses increased in line with increase in revenues. we continue to invest in our people, processes and infrastructure to support our goal to deliver high-quality offerings that meet the needs of our customers, differentiate our value proposition from that of our competition, and drive scale and growth.
the key highlights of our consolidated results for 2014 and 2013 were as follows:
•   the european segment continued its strong performance, generating revenue growth of $95.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2014, or 46.6% over 2013;
•   revenue increased in all our key verticals in 2014 as compared to 2013, specifically within the banking and financial services and travel and consumer verticals, which grew $59.1 million and $40.5 million respectively.
•   our organic growth was complemented by four strategic acquisitions completed during 2014, which expanded our highly skilled employee base, geographic footprint and service capabilities. through acquisitions, we added capabilities in the healthcare and life sciences industries, forming a foundation for emerging verticals.
•   income from operations grew by 12.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared with 2013 while income from operations as a percentage of revenues decreased by 2.0%. the decrease was due to a combination of factors, including an increase of $11.5 million in stock-based compensation expense, a $2.6 million increase in amortization and depreciation expenses related to our 2014 acquisitions, a $2.6 million write-down of prepaid assets to adjust the book value of prepaid construction costs to an estimated recoverable amount and a $1.1 million write-down of construction in progress costs, as well as a $2.2 million write off due to goodwill impairment in the russia segment.
•   net income increased by 12.3% during 2014 compared with 2013. expressed as a percentage of revenues, net income decreased by 1.7% due to the items noted above, as well as the effects of significant adverse foreign exchange rate changes to several currencies, specifically the russian ruble, in 2014 as compared to 2013.
the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.

in our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls, we discuss the following key measures that are not calculated according to u.s.gaap:
•   non-gaap income from operations is the income from operations as reported on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income exclusive of certain expenses and benefits.
•   non-gaap operating margin is the non-gaap income from operations as a percentage of reported revenues.
we believe that these non-gaap measures help illustrate trends in our core business and we use these measures to establish budgets and operational goals, manage our business and evaluate our performance. we exclude certain expenses and benefits from non-gaap income from operations that we believe are not reflective of these underlying business trends and are not useful measures in determining our operational performance and overall business strategy. because our reported non-gaap financial measures are not calculated according to gaap, these measures are not comparable to gaap and may not be comparable to similarly described non-gaap measures reported by other companies within our industry. consequently, our non-gaap financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation from or supplant comparable gaap measures, but, rather, should be considered together with our financial statements, which are prepared according to gaap. the following table presents a reconciliation of income from operations as reported on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income to non-gaap income from operations and non-gaap operating margin for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012:

from time to time, we acquire businesses and as such incur operating expenses, which are not related to our core company or segment operations and may include acquisition-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets. these costs vary with the size and complexity of the related acquisition and are generally inconsistent in amount and frequency, therefore, the size, complexity and volume of past acquisitions, which often drive the magnitude of acquisition-related costs, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and volume of future transactions and costs.
amortization of purchased intangible assets is excluded from our non-gaap measures to allow management to evaluate our operating results as if these assets have been developed internally rather than acquired in a business combination. we believe this approach provides a supplemental measure of performance in which the acquired intangible assets are treated in a manner comparable to the internally developed assets.
stock-based compensation expense is excluded from our non-gaap measures because we believe such exclusion allows for a more accurate comparison of our operating results among the periods, as well as enhances comparability with operating results of peer companies.
we also exclude certain other expenses and one-time charges that we believe are not indicative of what we consider to be organic continuing operations. such items include impairment write-offs of goodwill and other assets, legal settlement expenses, and certain other non-cash one-time charges and write offs.
see our "results of operations" section below for a more detailed discussion and analysis of these charges.
we have significant international operations, and we earn revenues and incur expenses in multiple currencies. when important to management's analysis, operating results are compared in "constant currency terms", a non-gaap financial

measure that excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. the effect of rate fluctuations is excluded by translating the current period's revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison. see item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" of this report for a discussion of our exposure to exchange rates.
effects of inflation economies in cis countries such as belarus, russia, kazakhstan and ukraine have periodically experienced high rates of inflation.
ukraine has been experiencing heightened political and economic turmoil with no improvement as of the date of this report. various news sources estimate that inflation has been increasing and the rate of increase has been accelerating throughout 2014. according to news reports, the peace talks continue and efforts to improve the government are in progress, however, the cost of the continuing crisis is severely impacting the ukrainian economy. the ukrainian currency has been weakened and the negative outlook in the ukrainian economy continues. the functional currency for financial reporting purposes in ukraine is us dollars.
due to russia's annexation of crimea, which was a part of ukraine, the united states and the european union have imposed and expanded sanctions targeting russian government and government-controlled interests and certain government officials. the expanded sanctions issued by the us department of treasury and the european union also restrict involvement in certain extensions of credit and financing activities for russian debtors and restrict certain business activities in sectors such as off-shore oil and defense. we believe these sanctions do not prevent us from providing our services to our customers.
in february 2014, the government of kazakhstan devalued the local currency, the tenge, by 19%. the government kept inflation for 2014 within forecasted range of 6% to 8% with forecast of around 7% for 2015 with a steady decrease towards 6% later that year. however, political and economic instability in the region may contribute to the economic uncertainty in kazakhstan.
belarus over the last several years has been experiencing hyperinflation. the measures currently used by the belarusian government to control this recent inflation include monetary policy and pricing instruments, including increasing interest rates and the use of anti-monopoly laws to prevent the increase in pricing of goods, as well as privatization and using foreign borrowings to replenish the budget and stabilize the local currency. inflation, government actions to combat inflation and public speculation about possible additional actions have also contributed to economic uncertainty in belarus. belarus may experience high levels of inflation in the future. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we had approximately $1.5, or 0.2%, of our revenues denominated in belarusian rubles. the functional currency for financial reporting purposes in belarus is us dollars.
periods of higher inflation may slow economic growth in those countries. inflation also is likely to increase some of our costs and expenses, which we may not be able to pass on to our clients and, as a result, may reduce our profitability. inflationary pressures could also affect our ability to access financial markets and lead to counter-inflationary measures that may harm our financial condition, results of operations or adversely affect the market price of our securities.
results of operations the following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated. this information should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.

revenues by client location our revenues are sourced from three geographic markets: north america, europe and cis. in 2014, we established a new geographic market in the apac region as a result of an acquisition. we present and discuss our revenues by client location based on the location of the specific client site that we serve, irrespective of the location of the headquarters of the client or the location of the delivery center where the work is performed. revenue by client location is different from the revenue by reportable segment in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. segments are not based on the geographic location of the clients but are rather based on the geography of the management responsible for a particular client regardless of client's physical location. the following table sets forth revenues by client location by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated:

revenues by contract type our services are performed under both time-and-material and fixed-price arrangements. our engagement models depend on the type of services provided to a client, the mix and locations of professionals involved and the business outcomes our clients are looking to achieve. historically, the vast majority of our revenues have been generated under time-and-material contracts. under time-and-material contracts, we are compensated for actual time incurred by our it professionals at negotiated hourly, daily or monthly rates. fixed-price contracts require us to perform services throughout the contractual period and we are paid in installments on pre-agreed intervals. we expect time-and-material arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the future.

revenues by client concentration we have grown our revenues from our clients by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements, and we have grown our key client base through internal business development efforts and several strategic acquisitions.
our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of 93.1% and 81.5% of our revenues in 2014 coming from clients that had used our services for at least one and two years, respectively. in addition, we have significantly grown the size of existing accounts. the number of clients that accounted for over $5.0 million in annual revenues increased to 24 in 2014 from 10 in 2010, and the number of clients that generated at least $0.5 million in revenues increased to 181 in 2014 from 72 in 2010.

operating expenses cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)
the principal components of our cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are salaries, employee benefits, stock compensation expense, travel costs and subcontractor fees for it professionals and subcontractors that are assigned to client projects. salaries and other compensation expenses of our it professionals are reported as cost of revenue regardless of whether they are actually performing client services during a given period.
the cost of revenues are dependent on utilization levels. our ability to manage our utilization levels depends significantly on our ability to hire and train high-performing it professionals and to staff projects appropriately. our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services. some of our it professionals are specifically hired and trained to work for specific clients or on specific projects, and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific clients or specific projects.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and general administrative functions of our business. these expenses include senior management, administrative personnel and sales and marketing personnel salaries; stock compensation expense, related fringe benefits, commissions and travel costs for those employees; legal and audit expenses, insurance, operating lease expenses, and the cost of advertising and other promotional activities. in addition, we pay a membership fee of 1% of revenues collected in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus hi-tech park.
our selling, general and administrative expenses have increased primarily as a result of our expanding operations, acquisitions, and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth. we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but will generally remain steady or slightly decrease as a percentage of our revenues.

provision for income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. as a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. during 2014, 2013 and 2012, we had $94.2, $69.8 million, and $56.6 million, respectively, in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions. the statutory tax rate in our foreign jurisdictions is lower than the statutory u.s. tax rate. additionally, we have secured special tax benefits in belarus and hungary as described below. as a result, our provision for income taxes is low in comparison to income before taxes due to the benefit received from increased income earned in low tax jurisdictions. the foreign tax rate differential represents this significant reduction. changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate.
our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related net interest. tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we cannot assure you that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hi-tech park, in which member technology companies are 100% exempt from the current belarusian income tax rate of 18%. the "on high-technologies park" decree, which created the belarus hi-tech park, is in effect for a period of 15 years from july 1, 2006.
our subsidiary in hungary benefits from a tax credit of 10% of annual qualified salaries, taken over a four-year period, for up to 70% of the total tax due for that period. we have been able to take the full 70% credit for 2007 to 2012. the hungarian tax authorities repealed the tax credit beginning with 2012. credits earned in years prior to 2012, however, were allowed through 2014. we have utilized up to the 70% limit until 2014.
our domestic income before provision for income taxes differs from the north america segment income before provision for income taxes because segment operating profit is a management reporting measure, which does not take into account most corporate expenses, as well as the majority of non-operating costs and stock compensation expenses. we do not hold our segment managers accountable for these expenses, as they cannot influence these costs within the scope of their operating authority, nor do we believe it is practical to allocate these costs to specific segments, as they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. all our segments are treated consistently with respect to such expenses when determining segment operating profit.
2014 compared to 2013
during 2014, our revenues grew in excess of 30.0% over 2013, from $555.1 million to a record $730.0 million. the increase was attributable to a combination of factors, including deeper penetration to existing customers and attainment of new customers, both organically and through acquisitions. in 2014, revenue from new customers was $49.7 million, primarily resulting from our 2014 acquisitions, and does not include new clients that are affiliates of existing customers. our 2014 acquisitions increased our total revenues by $39.8 million, however, some of the acquired clients are affiliated with our existing clients and, therefore, we consider them an expansion of existing business. in addition, total revenues in 2014 and 2013 included $8.4 million and $7.6 million of reimbursable expenses and other revenues, respectively, which increased by 10.3% in 2014 as compared to 2013, but remained relatively flat as a percentage of revenues.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, revenues in our largest geography, north america, grew $85.8 million, or 30.4%, as compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. expressed as a percentage of consolidated revenues, the north america geography accounted for 50.4% in 2014, which represented a decrease of 0.4% over 2013. the slight decrease was primarily a result of accelerated growth in the european geography.
revenues from all verticals in north america grew during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. the largest growth was in the north america's other vertical due to acquiring new clients in the healthcare, insurance and life sciences industries through a 2014 acquisition as well as creating synergies with existing customers in those markets. during the year ended december 31, 2014 combined revenue growth from customers in the other vertical accounted for $33.8 million, representing a 94.3%, growth over prior year.
our travel and consumer vertical in north america geography increased by $15.0 million, or 28.4%, as compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in this vertical was primarily driven by the rapid expansion of our strategic
39
relationship with a large retail chain, a relationship we acquired in 2012. during the year ended december 31, 2014, revenues from the business information and media vertical in north america increased by $12.5 million, or 21.8%, as compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. the growth in this vertical in 2014 was attributable to resumed growth in revenues from certain long-time major customers who had decreased demand for our services in 2013. north america's largest vertical, isvs and technology, experienced growth of $19.8 million or 16.2% during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared with the year ended december 31, 2013.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, our banking and financial services vertical remained our dominant vertical in europe geography. in 2014 revenues from the banking and financial services vertical increased by $42.5 million, or 39.9%, respectively, over the corresponding periods of 2013. continued solid performance of the banking and financial services vertical was attributable to an increased demand for our services and ongoing relationships with existing top customers located in europe. we experienced increased business from our top customer located in switzerland, nearly doubling the revenue during 2014 as compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. furthermore, we continue to see growing demand for our services from european-based customers within the travel and consumer and business information and media verticals. during the year ended december 31, 2014 combined revenues from these verticals increased by $30.9 million, respectively, year ended december 31, 2014 and accounted for 36.4% of total growth in this geography during periods indicated. europe's other vertical grew 65.0% or $8.0 million in 2014, mainly due to addition of new clients through our 2014 acquisitions.
revenues in the cis geography showed a decrease of $9.8 million or 14.9% on a year-to-date bases compared to 2013. the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to budgetary delays with certain customers located in russia, as well as a decline in business from one of our largest customers in kazakhstan. additionally, significant foreign currency fluctuations in russia and cis countries had a material negative impact on the revenues from those locations.
cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)
during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was $456.5 million and $347.7 million, respectively, representing an increase of 31.3% for the year ended december 31, 2014 over the corresponding period of 2013, mainly due to increase in hiring of revenue generating professionals. as a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), decreased 0.1% over the corresponding period of 2013, to 62.5% of consolidated revenues.
the increase in cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in 2014 was primarily driven by a $107.9 million increase in personnel-related costs, the main component of cost of revenue, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expense for our revenue generating it professionals of $3.8 million. the increases in all of these costs were the result of organic increase in headcount as well as personnel additions from acquisitions.
selling, general and administrative expenses we continued to invest in key areas, including sales, infrastructure, industry expertise, and other functions supporting global operations.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $163.7 million, representing an increase of 40.5% from $116.5 million during 2013. as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses represent 22.4% of consolidated revenues, an increase of 1.4% over last year. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2014 was primarily driven by a $30.2 million increase in total personnel-related costs, which include stock based compensation relating to the non-production personnel impact of the four 2014 acquisitions. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we incurred $13.4 million of selling, general and administrative costs related to our 2014 acquisitions, including $4.1 million of stock-based compensation expense, which resulted in a 1.8% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues.
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense was $17.5 million in 2014, representing an increase of $2.4 million over 2013. expressed as a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense totaled 2.4% and remained at the same level compared with 2013.
goodwill impairment loss we performed an annual goodwill impairment test as of october 31, 2014 in accordance with prescribed guidance. in assessing impairment both qualitatively and quantitatively based on the total of the expected future discounted cash flows directly related to the reporting unit, the company determined that the fair value of the russia reporting unit was below the carrying value of the reporting unit. the company completed the second step of the goodwill impairment test, resulting in an
40
impairment charge of $2.2 million as of december 31, 2014. all assets that related to the russia segment, excluding goodwill and including any unrecognized intangible assets, were assessed by management and deemed to not be impaired.
other operating expenses, net during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded a $2.6 million write-down in prepaid assets and a 1.1 million write-down of capitalized costs related to the construction of our corporate facilities in belarus. please see note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
interest and other income, net net interest and other income was $4.8 million in 2014, representing an increase of 55.0% from $3.1 million received in 2013. the increase was primarily driven by interest received on cash accounts in belarus and, to a lesser extent, interest earned on employee housing loans.
provision for income taxes the company's effective tax rate was 19.9% and 19.2% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the primary factors that caused this increase in the rate for the above-mentioned periods are: (a) the four acquisitions completed during 2014, which added other tax jurisdictions into the company's worldwide effective tax rate analysis; (b) a larger portion of the company's pre-tax profits attributable to tax jurisdictions with relatively higher effective tax rates (as compared to effective tax rates within the cis region) were seen in 2014 and (c) a relative shift in offshore services that were performed in belarus to other countries in the cis region (specifically ukraine and, to a lesser extent, russia). both of those locations have higher income tax rates than belarus, where the company is currently entitled to a 100% exemption from belarusian income tax.
2013 compared to 2012
revenues revenues were $555.1 million and $433.8 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, representing an increase of 28.0%. the increase was attributable to a combination of factors, including higher sales to existing and acquisition of new customers, which contributed $98.4 million and $21.7 million, respectively, to consolidated revenue growth. in addition, total revenues in 2013 and 2012 included $7.6 million and $6.4 million of reimbursable expenses and other revenues, respectively, which increased by 18.8% in 2013 as compared to 2012, but remained relatively flat as a percentage of revenues.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, north america, our largest geography, grew $74.8 million, or 36.2%, as compared with the year ended december 31, 2012. as a percentage of revenues, our north american geography accounted for 50.8% in 2013, which represented an increase of 3.1% over 2012. the growth in north america was driven by many realized opportunities in virtually every vertical. in particular, our isvs and technology vertical grew 30.0% as compared to 2012, primarily driven by an expansion of existing client relationships, which accounted for $25.9 million, or 91.6%, of the growth of this vertical over 2012. solid performance of our north american geography was also a reflection of additional revenue streams created by our 2012 acquisitions. this was especially noticeable in the business information and media vertical, which grew 8.9% in 2013 as compared to 2012 despite a significant decrease in revenues from one of our largest customers, thomson reuters. without the impact of declining revenues from this customer, the business information and media vertical increased $11.6 million, or 43.6% in 2013 over the corresponding periods of 2012. additionally, our travel and consumer vertical grew $18.7 million, or 55.1%, in 2013 as compared to 2012 and accounted for 25.0% of total growth in our north american geography in 2013. most of this increase was attributable to revenues from one of our strategic customers acquired in 2012, which had been on our "top ten" customer list since the second quarter of 2013. during the year ended december 31, 2013, revenues from this customer accounted for 20.7% of total revenue growth in north america, respectively.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, the banking and financial services vertical remained our dominant vertical in europe and accounted for 78.9% of total revenue growth in this geography. in 2013, revenues from banking and financial services vertical increased $35.5 million, or 49.8%, over 2012. it was also our largest and fastest growing vertical on a consolidated basis. strong performance of this vertical can be attributed to an increased demand for our services and ongoing relationship with existing customers located in europe. in particular, 29.5% of total revenue growth during 2013 over the 2012 results was attributable to increased business from certain of our largest banking and financial services customers located in the united kingdom and switzerland. additionally, over the course of the year ended december 31, 2013, our business information and media vertical grew significantly into the european markets. during the year ended december 31, 2013, this vertical increased $7.3 million, or 86.5%, over 2012, and accounted for 16.2% of the total growth in the european geography.
revenues in the cis geography increased $0.3 million, or 0.5%, in 2013 as compared to 2012. a slower growth rate as compared with the performance of other geographies in 2013 was due to a combination of factors. following the addition of a
41
number of new customers in the fourth quarter of 2012, revenues from our travel and consumer vertical increased $2.7 million, or 49.1%, in 2013 as compared with 2012. however, that growth in the travel and consumer vertical was more than offset by a lower growth rate in the banking and financial services vertical, the largest vertical in this geography, which increased $2.6 million, or 8.1%, in 2013 over 2012. in addition, included in 2012 results were $4.0 million of revenues recognized upon completion of a fixed-priced project that did not recur in 2013.
cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)
during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was $347.7 million and $270.4 million, respectively, representing an increase of 28.6% in 2013 over the corresponding period of 2012.
the increase in cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily driven by a net increase of 845 it professionals, from 8,495 as of december 31, 2012, to 9,340 as of december 31, 2013, to support the growth in demand for our services. as a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by 0.3% in 2013, as compared to the corresponding period of 2012, primarily as a result of higher compensation and benefits of our it professionals.
selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31, 2013, selling, general and administrative expenses were $116.5 million, representing an increase of 35.7% from $85.9 million in 2012. as a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 21.0% in 2013, or 1.2%, compared to 2012. most of this increase was attributable to higher compensation and benefits of our non-production staff in 2013 as compared to 2012 as we continued to invest into key areas, including sales, industry expertise, and other functions supporting global operations. in addition, selling, general and administrative expenses included $3.3 million of additional stock-based compensation expense related to our 2012 acquisitions, which caused our selling, general, and administrative expenses to increase by 0.5% as a percentage of revenues in 2013 over 2012.
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense was $15.1 million in 2013, representing an increase of $4.2 million over 2012. the increase was driven by additional capital expenditures to support headcount growth. as a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense increased to 2.7% in 2013 from 2.5% in 2012 primarily as a result of $1.9 million of additional expenses related to amortization of purchased intangible assets acquired in 2012.
other operating (income)/ expenses, net net other operating income was $0.6 million in 2013 as compared to $0.7 million of expenses recorded in the corresponding period of 2012. net other operating expenses recorded in 2012 were primarily attributable to the issuance of 53,336 shares of common stock to instant information inc., a 2010 asset acquisition, upon the completion of our initial public offering in the first quarter of 2012, which did not recur in 2013. additionally, during 2013 we received $0.8 million in connection with prior-year write-offs of other assets.
interest and other income, net net interest and other income was $3.1 million in 2013, representing an increase of 58.5% from $1.9 million received in 2012. the increase was largely driven by an increase in interest income earned on cash accounts in belarus and, to a lesser extent, interest earned on employee housing loans in 2013 which accounted for $0.3 million.
provision for income taxes our worldwide effective tax rate was 19.2% and 17.3% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in the worldwide effective tax rate in 2013, as compared to the corresponding period of 2012, was primarily due to (a) a higher portion of pre-tax profits attributable to our north american tax jurisdiction as a result of an acquisition completed in the second half of 2012; and (b) a relative shift in offshore services performed in belarus, where we currently entitled to a 100% exemption from belarusian income tax, to ukraine, and, to a lesser extent, russia, both of which have higher income tax rates.
results by business segment our operations consist of four reportable segments: north america, europe, russia and other. the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available that is used on a regular basis by our chief executive
42
officer, who is also our chief operating decision maker ("codm"), in determining how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. this determination is based on the unique business practices and market specifics of each region and that each region engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses. our reportable segments are based on managerial responsibility for a particular client. because managerial responsibility for a particular client relationship generally correlates with the client's geographic location, there is a high degree of similarity between client locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments. in some specific cases, however, managerial responsibility for a particular client is assigned to a management team in another region, usually based on the strength of the relationship between client executives and particular members of our senior management team. in a case like this, the client's activity would be reported through the management team's reportable segment. our codm evaluates the company's performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit.
segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to similar factors, pressures and challenges. expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses. we use globally integrated support organizations to realize economies of scale and efficient use of resources. as a result, a majority of our expenses is shared by all segments. these shared expenses include delivery, recruitment and development, sales and marketing, and support functions such as it, finance, legal, and human resources. generally, shared expenses are allocated based on measurable drivers of expense, e.g., recorded hours or headcount. however, certain expenses are not specifically allocated to specific segments, as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. further, stock based compensation expense is not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as "unallocated" and adjusted only against our total income from operations.
revenues from external clients and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the north america, europe, russia and other reportable segments for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

2014 compared to 2013
north america segment during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 revenues from our north america segment were 51.3% and 51.3% of total revenues representing an increase of $89.9 million, or 31.6%, over the corresponding period in 2013. the north america segment's operating profits increased by $23.8 million, or 35.6%, as compared to the same period of 2013, to $90.6 million net operating profit.
the increase in revenues during the year ended december 31, 2014, was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships, as well, as our recent acquisitions. the largest growth was in the other vertical due to acquiring new clients in the healthcare, insurance and life sciences industries through a 2014 acquisition as well as creating synergies with existing customers in those markets. during the year ended december 31, 2014, combined revenue growth from customers in the other vertical accounted for $34.8 million, representing a 97.4% growth over prior year.
43
all other verticals in the north america segment experienced revenue growth and increases in operating profit in 2014 as compared to 2013, mainly due to increased business from our long term clients with some contribution from the clients acquired in connection with acquisitions. the largest vertical, the isvs and technology, grew revenues by $22.1 million, or 18.6%, in 2014 as compared to the corresponding period of 2013. revenues from our travel and consumer vertical in 2014 increased by $14.6 million, or 26.7%, as compared to the corresponding period in 2013. banking and financial services had an increase in revenue of $5.9 million or 45.4%, and operating profit increased by 104.9% in this vertical in 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. business information and media grew in revenue $12.5 million or 20% for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013.
europe segment during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, revenues from our europe segment were 41.0% and 36.8% of total segment revenues, respectively, representing an increase of $95.1 million, or 46.6%, in 2014 over the 2013 results. during 2014, the europe segment's operating profits increased by $15.6 million, or 45.2%, as compared to the corresponding period of 2013, to $50.2 million net profit from the segment's operations.
europe continues to be a rapidly growing segment in our portfolio, given our nearshore delivery capabilities, and our value proposition in delivering quality software engineering solutions and services. our business model continues to gain considerable traction with european-based clients primarily in the banking and financial services and travel and consumer verticals. furthermore, our europe segment benefited from the acquisition of jointech, a company with locations in south-east asia, which created a new value proposition for our existing customers within the banking and financial services vertical, particularly in the areas of investment banking, wealth and asset management, and extended our reach into new geography. we expect that many of our new and existing customers in other business verticals will use our services in that fast-growing region resulting in possible revenue and operating profit increases to the europe segment.
russia and other segments during the years ended december 31, 2014, revenues from the russia and other operating segments decreased by $5.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively, over corresponding period of 2013. operating profits of the russia segment showed no changes when compared with the operating profits of this segment in 2013, while profits of other segments decreased $4.1 million compared to 2013.
revenues and operating profits in the russia and other segments are subject to volatility resulting from revenue recognition delays related to finalizing budgets for certain arrangements with major customers in those segments. as a result, we recorded the cost related to the performance of services in 2014 with no associated revenues recognized in the period that services were rendered. these business arrangements were further exacerbated by strong foreign currency fluctuations in the fourth quarter of 2014, negatively impacting our business in russia and cis countries.
2013 compared to 2012
north america segment during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, revenues from the north america segment were 51.3% and 45.5% of total segment revenues, respectively, representing an increase of $87.4 million, or 44.3%, in 2013 over the 2012 results. the north america segment's operating profits increased by $28.1 million, or 72.8%, as compared to the corresponding period of 2012, to $66.8 million net profit from the segment's operations.
the increase in revenues during year ended december 31, 2013, was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing client relationships, as well as by revenues contributed by new clients, including through the acquisitions of thoughtcorp and empathy lab completed in 2012. within the segment, revenue from our isvs and technology vertical increased $29.0 million, or 32.3%, in 2013 as compared to the corresponding period of 2012, representing 33.2% of the overall segment growth. our travel and consumer vertical was the fastest growing vertical in 2013 with revenues increasing by $26.5 million, or 94.6%, in 2013 as compared to the corresponding period in 2012. the increase in the segment's operating profit in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily driven by increased revenues and improved profitability, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits of our it professionals primarily as a result of added headcount to support our revenue growth and continued demand for onsite resources.
europe segment during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, revenues from our europe segment were 36.8% and 38.9% of total segment revenues, respectively, representing an increase of $35.2 million, or 20.9%, in 2013 over the 2012 results. during
44
2013, the europe segment's operating profits increased by $1.8 million, or 5.6%, as compared to the corresponding period of 2012, to $34.6 million net profit from the segment's operations.
europe continues to be a rapidly growing segment in our portfolio, given our nearshore delivery capabilities, and our value proposition in delivering quality software engineering solutions and services is continuing to gain considerable traction with european-based clients. within the segment, growth was the strongest in our banking and financial services vertical, with 2013 revenues increasing by approximately $36.9 million, or 52.0%, over the corresponding period of 2012. the decrease in the segment's operating profit as a percentage of the european segment's revenues in 2013 as compared to 2012, was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense relative to recognized service revenues in 2013 as compared to 2012.
russia segment during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, revenues from our russia segment were 10.0% and 11.7% of total segment revenues, respectively. in 2013, revenues from the russia segment were $55.8 million, representing an increase of $5.2 million, or 10.3%, over the 2012 results. during 2013, our russia segment's operating profits decreased by $2.0 million, or 21.8%, as compared to the corresponding period of 2012, to $7.1 million net profit from the segment's operations.
within the segment, 2013 revenues from the banking and financial services and travel and consumer verticals increased $2.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, accounting for most of the segment's growth in the period indicated. the decrease in operating profits of the russia segment in 2013 when compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to revenue recognition delays related to fixed-price projects. revenue recognition on such projects is susceptible to timing delays. as a result, there may be instances where we record the cost related to the performance of services with no associated revenue recognized in the period that services were rendered. in particular, we estimate a total of $2.5 million of revenues remained unrecognized as of december 31, 2013 in the russia segment, with related costs reflected in the segment's operating results for the year then ended. similarly, we may record revenue in a period where the underlying expenses have been recorded in a previous period, which would significantly improve the operating margin of the russia segment in the period of recognition. consequently, a higher concentration of fixed-price projects in the russia segment affects the period-over-period comparability of the segment's operating results.
other segment during the year ended december 31, 2013, revenues from the other segment were $10.5 million, or 1.9% of total segment revenues, representing a decrease of $6.5 million, or 38.2%, from the 2012 results. during 2013, our other segment's operating profits decreased by $6.1 million, as compared to the corresponding period of 2012, to $0.8 million.
the decrease in revenues and operating profits of the other segment in 2013, as compared to 2012, was primarily attributable to a completion of a large fixed-priced project in 2012 with $4.6 million revenues and $2.5 million operating profit recognized in 2012 that did not recur in 2013. in addition, the fourth quarter of 2012 benefited significantly from fixed-priced project with one of our largest customers in that segment that did not recur in 2013.
liquidity and capital resources capital resources at december 31, 2014, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $220.5 million, and $100.0 million of available borrowings under our revolving line of credit. as of that date, $176.3 million of our total cash and cash equivalents was held outside the united states. of this amount, $33.8 million was held in u.s. dollar denominated accounts in belarus, including deposits that accrued interest at an average interest rate of 4.1% during 2014. also, at december 31, 2014, $75.8 million in us dollars was held in a bank in uk by our cyprus entity, which was repatriated from belarus earlier in the year, and $14.4 million in russia. our subsidiaries in the cis or apac regions do not maintain significant balances denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollars.
the cash and cash equivalents held at locations outside of the united states are for future operating expenses and we have no intention of repatriating those funds. however, if necessary, there are no restrictions on repatriating those funds back to the united states. if we decide to remit funds to the united states in the form of dividends, $176.3 million would be subject to foreign withholding taxes, of which $168.6 million would also be subject to u.s. corporate income tax. we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents held in the united states and cash flow to be generated from domestic operations will be adequate to satisfy our domestic liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flows increase, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s. and the
45
availability of public and private debt and equity financing. to the extent we pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions, we may incur debt or sell additional equity to finance those acquisitions.
on september 12, 2014, we entered into a new agreement establishing a revolving credit facility with pnc bank, national association; santander bank, n.a; and silicon valley bank (collectively the "lenders"). this credit facility (the "2014 credit facility") consists of a $100.0 million revolving line of credit, with a maturity date of september 12, 2019. there is potential to increase the credit facility up to $200.0 million if certain conditions are met. borrowings under the 2014 credit facility may be denominated in united states dollars or, up to a maximum of $50.0 million in british pounds sterling, canadian dollars, euros or swiss francs (or other currencies as may be approved by the lenders). borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at either a base rate or euro-rate plus a margin based on the company's leverage ratio. base rate is equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds open rate, plus 0.5%, (b) the prime rate, and (c) the daily libor rate, plus 1.0%. the 2014 credit facility is secured by: (a) all tangible and intangible assets of the company, and its u.s.-based subsidiaries including all accounts, general intangibles, intellectual property rights and equipment; and (b) all of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity interests in u.s.-based subsidiaries of the company, and 65% of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity interests in certain of the company's foreign subsidiaries.
the line of credit also contains customary financial and reporting covenants and limitations. we are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our revolving line of credit and believe that our revolving line of credit provides sufficient flexibility such that we will remain in compliance with its terms in the foreseeable future. at december 31, 2014, we had no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit.

operating activities net cash provided by operations during the year ended december 31, 2014 increased $46.6 million to $104.9 million, as compared to $58.2 million net cash provided by operations in 2013. during 2014, operating cash flows benefited, in part, from our strong focus on improving working capital efficiencies during the latter part of 2013, including focus on reducing days outstanding for our billed and unbilled receivables. this emphasis more than offset the higher working capital requirements associated with increased revenues, including growth in total compensation and benefits of our it professionals, overhead expenses, and higher tax payments.
net cash provided by operations increased by $9.7 million to $58.2 million in 2013 from $48.5 million net cash provided by operations in 2012. for 2013, net cash provided by operations was primarily comprised of net income of $22.3 million before accounting for non-cash items such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, bad debt expense, and other items aggregating to $14.8 million. net increase in operating assets and liabilities in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily related to a reduction in prepaid and other assets by approximately $1.9 million as a result of non-recurring purchases made in 2012 coupled with a net increase in accrued expenses and trade payables of $2.0 million mainly due to a decrease in third party contractor expenses. this increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by higher billed and unbilled receivables of $7.6 million, which was mainly driven by increased volumes and higher ratio of fixed-priced projects in 2013 as compared to 2012, and a $6.1 million decrease in other net liabilities. the decrease in other net liabilities includes the effects of a higher portion of december salaries and related taxes released before the year-end in 2013 when compared to 2012 and a reduction in warranty revenues of $1.6 million related to several large non-recurring projects completed in prior periods.

investing activities net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2014 increased $31.1 million to $52.9 million as compared to $21.8 million used in investing activities during the corresponding period of 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to $37.1 million spent on acquisitions of businesses, partially offset by a net $6.2 million decrease in loans issued under the employee housing program compared to the corresponding period last year.
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2013 decreased by $37.8 million to $21.8 million, as compared to $59.6 million of net cash used in investing activities in 2012. the decrease in cash spent on investing activities in 2013 as compared to 2012, was primarily attributable to an $11.1 million decrease in payments made in connection with the construction of corporate facilities in belarus combined with a $32.9 million decrease in payments made in connection with our 2012 acquisitions. the decrease was partly offset by net payments of $5.8 million made by us in relation to employee loans issued under the employee housing program.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2014 was $10.3 million, a decrease of $5.2 million from the same period in 2013 primarily due to payment of deferred consideration in the amount of $4 million as well as a decrease in excess tax benefit on stock-based compensation plans, partly offset by higher proceeds from stock option exercises.
net cash provided by financing activities in 2013 decreased by $23.3 million to $15.5 million, as compared to $38.8 million provided by financing activities in 2012. this was primarily due to a net $30.6 million received in connection with our initial public offering of common stock in the first quarter of 2012 that did not recur in 2013, partially offset by an increase of $7.3 million in proceeds received by us in 2013 as a result of stock option exercises and associated tax benefits.

(1)   as of december 31, 2014, we estimated up to $8.2 million of additional investment could be required to complete construction of a 14,071 square meter office building within the high technologies park in minsk, belarus. please see note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
(2)   in the third quarter of 2012, our board of directors approved the employee housing program, which assists employees in purchasing housing in belarus. as part of the program, we will extend financing to employees up to an aggregate amount of $10.0 million.
future capital requirements we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives, including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future. our ability to generate cash, however, is subject to our performance, general economic conditions, industry trends and other factors. to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur. if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness, we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business. there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all.

off-balance sheet commitments and arrangements we do not have any obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k. we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us.
critical accounting policies we prepare our audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), which require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect: (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions, which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources. since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements, you should consider (i) our selection of critical accounting policies, (ii) the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our audited consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management.
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the audited consolidated financial statements. we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements. you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this annual report.
revenue recognition - we recognize revenue when realized or realizable and earned, which is when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. if there is an uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. at the time revenues are recognized, we provide for any contractual deductions and reduce revenues accordingly. we defer amounts billed to our clients for revenues not yet earned. such amounts are anticipated to be recorded as revenues as services are performed in subsequent periods. unbilled revenues represent services provided which are billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms.
we derive our revenues from a variety of service offerings, which represent specific competencies of our it professionals. contracts for these services have different terms and conditions based on the scope, deliverables, and complexity of the engagement, which require management to make judgments and estimates in determining appropriate revenue recognition pattern. fees for these contracts may be in the form of time-and-materials or fixed-price arrangements.
the majority of our revenues (84.7% of revenues in 2014, 82.3% in 2013 and 84.1% in 2012) are generated under time-and-material contracts whereby revenues are recognized as services are performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues when incurred. the majority of such revenues are billed on an hourly, daily or monthly basis whereby actual time is charged directly to the client.
revenues from fixed-price contracts (13.6% of revenues in 2014, 15.7% in 2013 and 13.7% in 2012) are determined using the proportional performance method. in instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the client, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. in absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenue is recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the client. in order to estimate the amount of revenue for the period under the proportional performance method, we determine the percentage of actual labor hours incurred as compared to estimated total labor hours and apply that percentage to the consideration allocated to the deliverable. the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related
48
expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. a number of internal and external factors can affect such estimates, including labor hours and specification and testing requirement changes. the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known. no significant revisions occurred in each of the three years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. our fixed price contracts are generally recognized over a period of 12 months or less.
we report gross reimbursable "out-of-pocket" expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income as these expenses are billable to our clients.
fair value of financial instruments - we make significant assumptions about fair values of its financial instruments. fair value is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. we utilize the following fair value hierarchy in determining fair values:
level 1 - quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices within level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates or yield curves.
level 3 - unobservable inputs reflecting our view about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
where the fair values of financial assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet cannot be derived from an active market, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques. these valuation techniques include a net present value technique, comparison to similar instruments with market observable inputs, options pricing models and other relevant valuation models. inputs into these models are taken from observable market data whenever possible, but in instances where it is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required to establish fair values.
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31, 2014, contingent liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis comprised contingent consideration payable in cash and stock, performance-based awards issued to certain former owners of acquired businesses in exchange for future services, and certain other contractual liabilities.
we estimate the fair value of contingent liabilities based on certain performance milestones of the acquired businesses, and estimated probabilities of achievement, then discount the liabilities to present value using our cost of debt for the cash component of contingent consideration, and risk free rate for the stock component of a contractual contingency. contingent liabilities are valued using significant inputs that are not observable in the market which are defined as level 3 inputs pursuant to fair value measurement accounting. we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, however, there is significant judgment involved. changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the timing and amount of specific milestone estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earnout criteria. these changes could cause a material impact to, and volatility in our operating results.
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis we issue loans to our employees under the employee housing program ("housing loans"). housing loans are issued in u.s. dollars with a 5-year term and carry an interest rate of 7.5%. the program was designed to be a retention mechanism for our employees in belarus.
although permitted by authoritative guidance, we did not elect a fair value option for these financial instruments. these housing loans are measured at fair value upon initial recognition and subsequently carried at amortized cost less allowance for loan losses. any difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a loan upon initial recognition ("day-one" recognition) is charged to expense.
the housing loans were classified as level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using significant unobservable inputs. the estimated fair value of these housing loans upon initial recognition was computed by projecting the future contractual cash flows to be received from the loans and discounting those projected net cash flows to a present value, which is the estimated fair value (the "income approach"). in applying the income approach, we analyzed similar loans offered by third-party financial institutions in belarusian rubles ("byr") and adjusted the interest rates charged on such loans to exclude the effects of underlying economic factors, such as inflation and currency devaluation. we also assessed the probability of future defaults and associated cash flows impact. in addition, we separately analyzed the rate of return that market participants in belarus would require when investing in unsecured usd-denominated government bonds
49
with similar maturities (a "risk-free rate") and evaluated a risk premium component to compensate the market participants for the credit and liquidity risks inherent in the loans' cash flows, as described in the following paragraph. as a result of the analysis performed, we determined the carrying values of the housing loans issued during the year ended december 31, 2014 approximated their fair values upon initial recognition. we also estimated the fair values of the housing loans that were outstanding as of december 31, 2014 using the inputs noted above and determined their fair values approximated the carrying values as of that date.
repayment of housing loans is primarily dependent on personal income of borrowers obtained through employment with epam, which income is set in u.s. dollars and is not closely correlated with common macroeconomic risks existing in belarus, such as inflation, local currency devaluation and decrease in the purchasing power of the borrowers' income. given a large demand for the program among our employees and its advantages as compared to alternative methods of financing available on the market, we expect the borrowers to fulfill their obligations, and we estimate the probability of voluntary termination of employment among the borrowers as de minimis. additionally, housing loans are capped at $50 thousand per loan and secured by real estate financed through the program. we establish a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 70% and expect a decrease in the ratio over the life of a housing loan due to on-going payments by employees.
business combinations - we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method, which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired, including related goodwill and other intangible assets. we identify and attribute fair values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired and allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. there are different valuation models for each component, the selection of which requires considerable judgment. these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable, but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain.
if initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs, provisional amounts are reported for which the accounting is incomplete, with retrospective adjustment made to such provisional amounts during the measurement period to present new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. once the measurement period ends, and in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date, revisions of the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings.
all acquisition-related costs, other than the costs to issue debt or equity securities, are accounted for as expense in the period in which they are incurred. changes in fair value of contingent consideration arrangements that are not measurement period adjustments are recognized in earnings. payments to settle contingent consideration, if any, are reflected in cash flows from financing activities and the changes in fair value are reflected in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets, as the principal assets typically acquired are customer relationships, trade names, non-competition agreements, and workforce. as a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.
goodwill and other intangible assets - goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are treated consistently with asc 350. they are tested annually for impairment and are not amortized. events or circumstances that might require impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations.
intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. when facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment of amortizable intangible assets, we evaluate the recoverability of the asset's carrying value, using estimates of undiscounted future cash flows that utilize a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model over the remaining asset life. the estimates of future cash flows attributable to intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results. any impairment loss is measured by the excess of carrying value over fair value.
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, all of our intangible assets had finite lives and we did not incur any impairment losses in respect of our intangible assets during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.
effective in the fourth quarter of 2013, we changed the annual goodwill impairment assessment date for all of our reporting units from december 31st to october 31st, which represented a voluntary change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date.  we are also required to assess the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment between annual assessment dates
50
when events or circumstances dictate. we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level and we had three reporting units that had recorded goodwill, which were subject to the annual impairment testing in 2014. our annual impairment review as of october 31, 2014 resulted in an impairment charge for the russian reporting unit. there was no impairment charge for any of these reporting units as of october 31, 2013.
for our annual impairment test, we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying values in order to determine if impairment is indicated. if so, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared to its carrying amount, and the impairment loss is measured by the excess of the carrying value over fair value. the fair values are estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings multiples based on market data. these valuations are considered level 3 measurements under fasb asc topic 820. we utilize estimates to determine the fair value of the reporting units such as future cash flows, growth rates, capital requirements, effective tax rates and projected margins, among other factors. estimates utilized in the future evaluations of goodwill for impairment could differ from estimates used in the current period calculations.
when facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment of amortizable intangible assets, we evaluate the recoverability of the asset's carrying value, using estimates of undiscounted future cash flows that utilize a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model over the remaining asset life. the estimates of future cash flows attributable to intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results. any impairment loss is measured by the excess of carrying value over fair value.
income taxes - the provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the audited consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes. we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings. any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. once a valuation allowance has been established, it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. a pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance. if the allowance is reversed in a future period, the income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced. accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings.
changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future. the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 (the "act") was signed into law on january 2, 2013. because a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment, certain provisions of the act benefiting our 2012 u.s. federal taxes, including the subpart f controlled foreign corporation look-through exception were not recognized in our 2012 financial results and instead were reflected in our 2013 financial results.
stock-based compensation - equity-based compensation cost relating to the issuance of share-based awards to employees is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant, which is expensed ratably over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate. therefore, changes in the forfeiture assumptions may affect the timing of the total amount of expense recognized over the vesting period. the service period is the period over which the employee performs the related services, which is normally the same as the vesting period. equity-based awards that do not require future service are expensed immediately. equity-based awards that do not meet criteria for equity classification are recorded in liabilities and adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period. distributions associated with liability-classified awards not expected to vest are accounted for as compensation expense in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 13 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for information regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our audited consolidated financial statements.

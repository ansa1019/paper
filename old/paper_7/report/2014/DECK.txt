item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation.
references to "deckers," "we," "us," "our," or similar terms refer to deckers outdoor corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries. unless otherwise specifically indicated, all amounts herein are expressed in thousands, except for share quantity, per share data, and selling prices. the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our accompanying consolidated financial statements in part iv of this annual report and the accompanying notes to those statements included in part iv of this annual report.
overview we are a global leader in designing, marketing and distributing innovative footwear, apparel and accessories developed for both everyday casual lifestyle use and high performance activities.  we market our products primarily under three proprietary brands:
•   ugg®: premier brand in luxurious comfort footwear, handbags, apparel, home and cold weather accessories;
•   teva®: born from the outdoors, active lifestyle footwear for the adventurous spirit; and
•   sanuk®: innovative action sport footwear brand rooted in the surf community.
our financial condition and results of operations include the operations of hoka one one® (hoka) beginning september 27, 2012, the acquisition date. in addition to our primary brands, our other brands include ahnu®, a line of outdoor performance and lifestyle footwear; hoka, a line of footwear for all capacities of runners designed with a unique performance midsole geometry, oversized midsole volume and active foot frame; mozo®, a line of footwear crafted for culinary professionals that redefines the industry's dress code; and tsubo®, a line of mid and high-end dress and dress casual comfort footwear that incorporates style and function with maximum comfort.
we sell our brands through quality domestic retailers and international distributors and retailers, as well as directly to our end-user consumers through our e-commerce business and retail stores. independent third parties manufacture all of our products.
our business has been and we expect that it will continue to be impacted by what we believe are several important trends:
•   sales of our products are highly seasonal and are sensitive to weather conditions, which are beyond our control. even though we are creating more year-round styles for our brands, the effect of favorable or unfavorable weather on sales can be significant.
•   continuing uncertainty surrounding us and global economic conditions has adversely impacted businesses worldwide. some of our customers have been, and more may be, adversely affected, which in turn has, and may continue to, adversely impact our financial results.
•   the sheepskin used in certain ugg products is in high demand and limited supply, and there have been significant fluctuations in the price of sheepskin over the years as the demand from competitors for this material has changed.
•   our use of uggpure®, real wool woven into a durable backing used as an alternative to table grade sheepskin, in select products, primarily in linings and foot beds, continues to grow.
•   the markets for casual, outdoor, and athletic footwear have grown significantly during the last decade. we believe this growth is a result of the trend toward casual dress in the workplace, increasingly active outdoor lifestyles, and a growing emphasis on comfort.
•   consumers are more often seeking footwear designed to address a broader array of activities with the same quality, comfort, and high performance attributes they have come to expect from traditional athletic footwear.
•   consumers have narrowed their footwear product breadth, focusing on brands with a rich heritage and authenticity as market category creators and leaders.
•   consumers have become increasingly focused on luxury and comfort, seeking out products and brands that are fashionable while still comfortable.
25
•   there is an emerging sustainable lifestyle movement happening all around the world, and consumers are demanding that brands and companies become more environmentally responsible.
•   consumers are following a recent trend of buy now, wear now. this trend entails the consumer waiting to purchase shoes until they will actually wear them, contrasted with a tendency in the past to purchase shoes they did not plan to wear until later.
by emphasizing our brands' images and our focus on comfort, performance and authenticity, we believe we can continue to maintain a loyal consumer following that is less susceptible to fluctuations caused by changing fashions and changes in consumer preferences. we have also responded to consumer focus on sustainability by establishing objectives, policies, and procedures to help us drive key sustainability initiatives around human rights, environmental sustainability, and community affairs.
we have experienced significant cost fluctuations over the past several years, notably with respect to sheepskin. we attempt to cover the full amount of our sheepskin purchases under fixed price contracts. we continually strive to contain our material costs through increasing the mix of non-sheepskin products, exploring new footwear materials and new production technologies, and utilizing lower cost production. also, refer to part ii, item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for further discussion of our commodity price risk.
below is an overview of the various components of our business, including some key factors that affect each business and some of our strategies for growing each business.
ugg brand overview the ugg brand is one of the most iconic and recognized brands in the global footwear industry and highlights our successful track record of building niche brands into lifestyle market leaders. with loyal consumers around the world, the ugg brand has proven to be a highly resilient line of premium footwear, with expanded product offerings and a growing global audience that attracts women, men and children. ugg brand footwear continually earns media exposure from numerous outlets both organically and from strategic public relations efforts, including an increasing amount of exposure internationally. the ugg brand has invested in creating holistic, impactful integrated campaigns across paid, earned and owned media channels, including mobile, digital, social, out-of-home (ooh) and print, which are globally scalable, contributing to broader public awareness of the brand.
we believe the increased global media focus and demand for ugg products has been driven by the following:
•   high consumer brand loyalty, due to over 35 years of delivering quality and luxuriously comfortable ugg footwear;
•   continued innovation of new product categories and styles, including those beyond footwear such as loungewear, handbags, cold-weather accessories and a new home offering;
•   a more robust footwear offering, including transitional products that bridge the seasons between spring and fall;
•   expanded slipper category showing incremental growth with added styles for both women, men and children;
•   growing direct-to-consumer platform and enhanced omnichannel capabilities that enable us to increasingly engage existing and prospective consumers in a more connected environment to introduce our evolving product lines;
•   product customization with our ugg by you program allows for deeper connection with brand and products;
•   focus on mobile consumers with responsive website design providing shoppers access to the brand from their mobile devices;
•   year-round holistic paid advertising approach for women, men and children in targeted digital, high-end print, ooh and across multiple social media platforms;
•   holiday and winter focused advertising campaign to drive important seasonal sales;
•   continued creation of targeted ugg for men campaigns;
26
•   targeted e-commerce based marketing to existing and prospective consumers through integrated outreach including email blasts, interactive website design and search engine optimization based content;
•   continued partnerships with high-end retailers such as nordstrom, dillard's and bloomingdales;
•   expanded product assortments from existing accounts;
•   adoption by high-profile celebrities as a favored footwear brand;
•   continued media attention that has enabled us to introduce the brand to consumers much faster than we would have otherwise been able to;
•   increased exposure to the brand driven by our concept stores that showcase all of our product offerings; and
•   continued expansion of worldwide retail through new ugg stores.
we believe the luxurious comfort of ugg products will continue to drive long-term consumer demand. recognizing that there is a significant fashion element to ugg footwear and that footwear fashions fluctuate, our key strategies include presenting ugg as a year-round global, premium lifestyle brand with a broad product line suitable for wear in a variety of climates and occasions and limiting retail distribution. as part of this strategic approach, we have increased our product offerings, including a growing transitional collections and spring line, an expanded men's line, a fall line that consists of a range of luxurious collections for both genders, an expanded kids' line, as well as home, handbags, cold weather accessories, and apparel products. we have also recently expanded our marketing and promotional efforts, which we believe has contributed, and will continue to contribute, to our growth. we believe that the evolution of the ugg brand and our strategy of product diversification will also help decrease our reliance on sheepskin, which is in high demand and subject to price volatility. nonetheless, we cannot assure investors that our efforts will continue to provide ugg brand growth.
teva brand overview for 30 years teva has fueled the expression of freedom through the adventure lifestyle around the globe. teva pioneered the sport sandal category in 1984. we believe that teva's originals collection is a key platform in driving market penetration for the brand. the originals collection honors the heritage of teva by revamping the styles the brand was founded on by blending their original simplicity with modern sophistication. in the us, our focus will be to bolster our leadership position in sandals and grow our market share through casual category extensions. globally, we seek to establish the originals collection as a catalyst for the teva brand's success across warm-weather climates.
within the us, we expect that teva will grow its position as a market leader within the sport sandal category. growth opportunities within our current core channels of distribution - outdoor specialty, sporting goods and family footwear retail chains - will be pursued through deepening penetration with evolved and expanded product offerings. teva plans to support its channel expansion beyond present distribution with focused investments in targeted, solution-driven marketing programs in order to attract new lifestyle consumers to the brand. however, we cannot assure investors that these efforts will be successful.
sanuk brand overview the sanuk brand was founded 17 years ago, and from its origins in the southern california surf culture, has grown into a global brand with an expanding fan base and growing presence in the relaxed casual shoe and sandal categories. the sanuk brand's use of unexpected materials and unconventional constructions combined with its fun and funky branding has contributed to the brand's identity and growth since its inception, and led to successful products such as the yoga mattm sandal collection and the patented sidewalk surfers®.  we believe that the sanuk brand provides substantial growth opportunities, especially within the casual sneaker markets, supporting our strategic initiatives spanning new product launches, and omnichannel development and global expansion. however, we cannot assure investors that our efforts to grow the brand will be successful.
other brands overview our other brands consist of ahnu, hoka, mozo and tsubo. our other brands are sold through most of our distribution channels, primarily through wholesale channels.
ahnu is an authentic performance footwear brand that makes footwear for fashion-minded people who prefer trails, yoga mats, and hybrid fitness workouts. ahnu's products feature après-yoga styling, innovative trail and city hikers, and everyday casual shoes and sandals.  ahnu's go-anywhere approach blurs the lines between performance and fashion through modern color and material stories infused with numentum® performance technology.
27
the hoka brand focuses on designing shoes with a unique performance midsole geometry, oversized midsole volume and an active foot frame. we believe runners from around the world are experiencing the benefits of hoka brand products. these shoes are used by marathon runners, and even ultra-marathon runners as well as every day runners to enjoy running.
with respect to ahnu and hoka, we expect to leverage our design, marketing, and distribution capabilities. nevertheless, we cannot assure investors that our efforts to grow these brands will be successful.
with respect to mozo and tsubo, we are seeking strategic alternatives for these businesses.
e-commerce overview our e-commerce business, which sells all of our brands, allows us to build our relationship with the consumer and is a key component of our integrated omnichannel strategy. e-commerce enables us to meet the growing demand for our products, sell the products at retail prices, and provide significant incremental operating income. the e-commerce business provides us an opportunity to communicate to the consumer with a consistent brand message that is in line with our brands' promises, drives awareness of key brand initiatives, and offers targeted information to specific consumer segments. our websites also drive wholesale and distributor sales through brand awareness and directing consumers to retailers that carry our brands, including our own retail stores. in recent years, our e-commerce business has had significant revenue growth, much of which occurred as the ugg brand gained popularity and as consumers continued to increase internet usage for footwear and other purchases.
managing our e-commerce business requires us to focus on the latest trends and techniques for web design and marketing, to generate internet traffic to our websites, to effectively convert website visits into orders, and to maximize average order sizes. we plan to continue to grow our e-commerce business through improved website features and performance, increased marketing, expansion into more international markets, and utilization of mobile and tablet technology. nevertheless, we cannot assure investors that revenue from our e-commerce business will continue to grow.
retail stores overview our retail stores are predominantly ugg concept stores and ugg outlet stores. in 2013, we expanded our fleet and opened our first sanuk (two concept, one outlet) stores. our retail stores enable us to directly impact our customers' experience, meet the growing demand for these products, sell the products at retail prices and generate strong annual operating income. in addition, our ugg concept stores allow us to showcase our entire product line including footwear, accessories, handbags, home, outerwear, lounge and retail exclusive items; whereas, a wholesale account may not represent all of these categories. through our outlet stores, we sell some of our discontinued styles from prior seasons, as well as full price in-line products, and products made specifically for the outlet stores. through our integrated omnichannel strategy, we believe that consumers try on products in our retail stores, perform further online research and order products online and, conversely, e-commerce fuels our retail locations. as a result, we believe that our stores and websites are mutually dependent in a way that will allow us to view them on a combined basis. further, a number of our stores allow the consumer to buy through our e-commerce channel using internet capable devices in our stores.
as of march 31, 2015, we had a total of 142 retail stores worldwide. these stores are company-owned and operated and include our china stores, which prior to april 2, 2012 were owned and operated with our joint venture partner. on april 2, 2012, we purchased the remaining interest in our chinese joint venture. during fiscal year 2016, we plan to open additional company-owned retail stores worldwide.
during the year ended march 31, 2015, we converted seven of our retail stores in china to partner retail stores, whereby, upon conversion, the stores became wholly-owned and operated by local, third-party companies within china.  these conversions included the assignment of the lease and the sale of both our on-hand inventory and store leasehold improvements to the operator.  as of the date of conversion, partner retail stores sales are included in our ugg brand wholesale segment and not included in our retail stores segment. during fiscal year 2016, we plan to convert additional retail stores in china to partner retail stores.
seasonality our business is seasonal, with the highest percentage of ugg brand net sales occurring in the quarters ending september 30 and december 31, and the highest percentage of teva and sanuk brand net sales occurring in the quarters ending march 31 and june 30 of each year. our other brands are not significantly impacted by the season.
in february 2014, our board of directors approved a change in the company's fiscal year end from december 31 to march 31. the change is intended to better align our planning, financial and reporting functions with the seasonality of our business. the fiscal 2015 and 2013 years ended on march 31, 2015 and december 31, 2013, respectively. the 2014 transition period was the quarter ended march 31, 2014 to coincide with the change in our fiscal year end.

with the large growth in the ugg brand over the past several years, net sales in the quarters ending september 30 and december 31 have exceeded net sales in the quarters ending march 31 and june 30. we currently expect this trend to continue. nonetheless, actual results could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences, availability of product, competition, and our wholesale and distributor customers continuing to carry and promote our various product lines, among other risks and uncertainties. see part i, item 1a, "risk factors" for a further discussion of our risk factors.

in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, throughout this annual report we provide certain financial information on a "constant currency basis", which is in addition to the actual financial information presented. in order to calculate our constant currency information, we translate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period. however, constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to us dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles.
we experienced an increase in net sales in all brands and distribution channels with the largest impact due to increased ugg brand sales through our wholesale channel, retail stores and e-commerce websites, as well as increased other brands sales through our wholesale channel. on a constant currency basis, net sales increased by 18.0% to approximately $1,837,000. we experienced an increase in the number of pairs sold in all segments. this resulted in a 17.6% overall increase in the volume of footwear sold for all brands and channels to approximately 30.7 million pairs for the year ended march 31, 2015 compared to approximately 26.1 million pairs for the year ended december 31, 2013. our weighted-average wholesale selling price per pair decreased to $46.53 for the year ended march 31, 2015 from $46.87 for the year ended december 31, 2013. the decreased average selling price was primarily due to our teva and sanuk wholesale segments, partially offset by an increase in the average selling price in our other brands wholesale segment.
30
wholesale net sales of our ugg brand increased primarily due to an increase in the volume of pairs sold, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. on a constant currency basis, wholesale sales of our ugg brand increased by 11.1% to approximately $909,000. for ugg wholesale net sales, the increase in volume had an impact of approximately $89,000, including approximately $5,000 related to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
wholesale net sales of our teva brand increased primarily due to an increase in the volume of pairs sold, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted-average wholesale selling price per pair. the decrease in average selling price was primarily due to a shift in product mix and an increased impact from closeout sales. for teva wholesale net sales, the increase in volume had an impact of approximately $15,000 and the decrease in average selling price had an impact of approximately $7,000.
wholesale net sales of our sanuk brand increased primarily due to an increase in the volume of pairs sold, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted-average wholesale selling price per pair. the decrease in average selling price was primarily due to a shift in product mix. for sanuk wholesale net sales, the increase in volume had an impact of approximately $14,000 and the decrease in average selling price had an impact of approximately $5,000.
wholesale net sales of our other brands increased due to an increase in the volume of pairs sold as well as an increase in the weighted-average wholesale selling price per pair. the increase in average selling price was primarily due to a shift in brand mix. the increase in volume of pairs sold had an impact of approximately $36,000 and the increase in average selling price had an impact of approximately $2,000.
net sales of our e-commerce business increased due to an increase in the number of pairs sold, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted-average selling price per pair. the decrease in the average selling price was primarily due to a shift in product mix and increased sales discounts. for e-commerce net sales, the increase in volume had an impact of approximately $63,000 and the decrease in average selling price had an impact of approximately $2,000.
net sales of our retail store business, which are primarily ugg brand sales, increased largely due to the addition of new stores opened since december 31, 2013, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. on a constant currency basis, net sales of our retail store business increased by 20.7% to approximately $394,000. a large majority of the new stores were in the us and china, with the remaining new stores in japan, canada and hong kong. same store sales for the 52 weeks ending march 29, 2015 decreased 8.4% compared to the 52 weeks ended december 29, 2013. the decrease in same store sales is primarily due to a shift in sales of our classic styles to online from in-store, as well as a shift in product mix whereby we sold more casual styles, which generally carry lower price points.  for retail same store sales, we experienced a decrease in weighted-average selling price of approximately $19,000. as we continue to increase the number of retail stores, each new store will have less significant impact on our growth rate.
international sales, which are included in the segment sales above, for all of our products combined increased by 26.7% for the year ended march 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. on a constant currency basis, international sales increased by 30.5% to approximately $671,000. international sales represented 35.9% and 33.0% of worldwide net sales for the years ended march 31, 2015 and december 31, 2013, respectively. the increase in international sales as a percentage of worldwide net sales was largely due to the continued growth in our ugg brand internationally across all channels of approximately $122,000.
foreign income before income taxes was $95,850 and $60,851, and worldwide income before income taxes was $221,139 and $205,557 for the years ended march 31, 2015 and december 31, 2013, respectively. foreign income before income taxes represented 43.3% and 29.6% of worldwide income before income taxes for the years ended march 31, 2015 and december 31, 2013, respectively. the increase in foreign income before income taxes as a percentage of worldwide income before income taxes was primarily due to increased compensation earned by our foreign-based global product sourcing organization as a result of a strategic supply chain reorganization completed during the year ended march 31, 2015.
we expect that our foreign income before income taxes will fluctuate from year to year based on several factors, including our expansion initiatives. in addition, we believe that the continued evolution and geographic scope of the ugg brand, our continuing strategy of enhancing product diversification, and our expected growth in our international retail and e-commerce business, will result in increases in foreign income before income taxes as a percentage of worldwide income before income taxes in future years.
gross profit.  overall gross margin increased 100 basis points, primarily due to an increase in the mix of retail and e-commerce sales, which generally carry higher margins than our wholesale segments. the increased mix of retail and e-commerce sales contributed approximately 70 basis points to the overall increase in gross margin. an increase in the ugg brand wholesale gross margin, primarily related to the july 2014 acquisition of our ugg brand distributor in germany, contributed approximately
31
20 basis points to the overall increase in gross margin.  the factors discussed above include the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors including the factors discussed above.
selling, general and administrative expenses.    the change in sg&a expenses was primarily due to:
•   increased retail costs of approximately $44,000 largely related to new retail stores that were not open as of december 31, 2013 and related corporate infrastructure;
•   increased expenses of approximately $20,000 for marketing and promotions related to our wholesale business, primarily for the hoka and ugg brands;
•   increased e-commerce expenses of approximately $18,000 largely related to increased marketing and advertising and the expansion of our e-commerce business;
•   increased expenses of approximately $16,000 for corporate infrastructure to support our international wholesale expansion and omnichannel transformation;
•   increased information technology costs of approximately $8,000, in part due to accelerating the amortization expense for certain software projects that will not be used;
•   increased sales and commission expenses of approximately $8,000 largely driven by the increase in wholesale sales;
•   increased us distribution center costs of approximately $7,000, largely driven by the increase in sales and our new moreno valley distribution center; and
•   increased expenses of approximately $7,000 related to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
these increases were partially offset by decreased recognition of performance-based cash compensation of approximately $8,000.
performance-based compensation as noted above, the recognition of performance-based cash compensation decreased by approximately $8,000 over the prior fiscal year period. as of march 31, 2015, the target level of the performance objectives relating to our fiscal year 2015 performance-based cash awards was only partially achieved, and we have recognized the expense accordingly. in contrast, as of december 31, 2013, we achieved above the target level of the performance objectives relating to our 2013 performance-based cash awards and we recognized expense for those 2013 awards accordingly at that time.
at the beginning of each fiscal year, our compensation committee reviews our operating results from the prior fiscal year, as well as the financial and strategic plan for the next fiscal year and for subsequent fiscal years. the committee then establishes specific annual company financial goals and specific strategic goals for each executive. performance-based cash compensation awards for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2013 were earned above target levels, and performance-based cash compensation awards for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015 were only partially earned, based on our achievement of certain targets for annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda), as well as achievement of pre-determined individual financial and non-financial performance goals that are tailored to individual employees based on their role and responsibilities at the company. the performance objectives and goals, as well as the targets, differ each year and are based upon many factors, including the company's current business stage and strategies, recent company financial and operating performance, expected growth rates over prior year's performance, business and general economic conditions and market and peer group analysis. for example, in evaluating targets for the 2013 fiscal year, our compensation committee reviewed, among other things, our ebitda for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2012, which was approximately $229.7 million, and, in evaluating targets for the 2015 fiscal year, our compensation committee reviewed, among other things, our ebitda for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2013, which was approximately $251.8 million. performance objectives for the 2015 fiscal year were based, in part, upon the expected achievement of growth in the company's ebitda for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015 as compared to the company's ebitda for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2013. the company's higher ebitda for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the fiscal year ended december 31, 2012 resulted in fiscal year 2015 ebitda targets that were higher than the 2013 ebitda targets.
32
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we recognize performance-based compensation expenses when it is deemed probable that the applicable performance-based goal will be met. we evaluate the probability of achieving performance-based goals on a quarterly basis. our assessment of the probability of achieving specified goals can fluctuate from quarter to quarter as we assess our projected achievement as compared to specified performance targets. as a result, the compensation expense we recognize may also fluctuate from period to period.

income from operations increased due to the increase in sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher sg&a expenses as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. on a constant currency basis, income from operations increased by 13.5% to approximately $236,000.
the increase in income from operations of ugg brand wholesale was primarily the result of the increase in net sales as well as a 3.1 percentage point increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of approximately $16,000 including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. the increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in higher-margin wholesale sales, largely related to the acquisition of our ugg brand distributor in germany. the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to marketing and promotions, amortization and sales and commissions.
the increase in income from operations of teva brand wholesale was primarily the result of a decrease in operating expenses of approximately $5,000 as well as the increase in net sales, partially offset by a 3.1 percentage point decrease in gross margin. the decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreased design and sales and commission expenses. the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an increased impact from closeout sales.
the increase in income from operations of sanuk brand wholesale was primarily the result of the increase in net sales as well as a decrease in operating expenses of approximately $2,000, partially offset by a 4.8 percentage point decrease in gross margin. the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a shift in sales mix as well as an increased impact from closeout sales.
loss from operations of our other brands wholesale was comparable to the prior period.
the increase in income from operations of our e-commerce business was primarily due to the increase in net sales. this increase was partially offset by an overall increase in operating expenses of approximately $9,000 as well as a 3.0 percentage point decrease in gross margin. the overall increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased marketing and advertising and the expansion of our e-commerce business of approximately $18,000, partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the current year of approximately $7,000 compared to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $2,000 in the prior period. the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales discounts.
the decrease in income from operations of our retail store business, which primarily relates to the ugg brand, was primarily due to increased operating expenses of approximately $43,000, largely offset by the increase in net sales, and includes the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. the increase in operating expenses largely related to our new store openings
33
and related corporate infrastructure.  on a constant currency basis income from operations of our retail store business decreased 2.6% to approximately $64,000.
the increase in unallocated overhead costs was primarily due to (1) expense related to increased corporate infrastructure of approximately $16,000 to support our omnichannel transformation and international wholesale expansion, (2) the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $16,000, (3) increased information technology costs of approximately $8,000, (4) increased us distribution center costs of approximately $7,000 and (5) increased depreciation expenses of approximately $4,000 related to our corporate headquarters buildings, partially offset by a reduction in performance-based compensation of approximately $5,000.
other expense, net.    the increase in other expense, net was primarily due to an increase in interest expense.
income taxes.    income tax expense and effective income tax rates were as follows:
years ended
3/31/2015            12/31/2013
income tax expense            $59,359               $59,868
effective income tax rate        26.8     %   29.1              %
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of annual pre-tax income. this decrease was partially offset by overall discrete tax liabilities of approximately $1,600 recognized during the year ended march 31, 2015 compared to overall discrete tax benefits of approximately $900 recognized during the year ended december 31, 2013. the discrete tax liabilities relate to provisions recorded for unrecognized tax benefits as well as prior year us federal and state tax adjustments. the discrete tax benefits relate to a combination of prior year us federal, state and foreign tax adjustments. for the fiscal year 2015, we generated approximately 25.0% of our pre-tax earnings from a country which does not impose a corporate income tax. unremitted earnings of non-us subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested outside of the us indefinitely. such earnings would become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these subsidiaries or upon the remittance of dividends. as of march 31, 2015, we had approximately $132,000 of cash and cash equivalents outside the us that would be subject to additional income taxes if it were to be repatriated. we have no plans to repatriate any of our foreign cash.
net income.    our net income increased as a result of the items discussed above. our diluted earnings per share increased primarily as a result of the increase in net income, as well as by a reduced number of diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. the reduction in the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding was the result of our share repurchases during the year ended march 31, 2015. the weighted-average impact of the share repurchases was a reduction of approximately 200,000 shares.

overview.  the increase in overall net sales was primarily due to an increase in our ugg brand sales through our retail stores and e-commerce sites as well as an increase in our other brands wholesale sales, partially offset by a decrease in teva wholesale sales.  we experienced a loss from operations during the three months ended march 31, 2014 compared to income from operations for the three months ended march 31, 2013. the change resulted from higher sg&a expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross profit.

the increase in overall net sales was primarily due to an increase in our ugg brand sales through our retail stores and e-commerce sites. in addition, net sales increased from our other brands sales through the wholesale channel, increased sanuk brand sales through our retail stores, increased other brands sales through our e-commerce sites, and increased ugg brand wholesale sales. these increases were partially offset by decreased wholesale sales of our teva brand and our sanuk brand.  on a constant currency basis, net sales increased by 12.4% to approximately $296,000. we experienced an increase in the number of pairs sold in the retail, other brands wholesale and e-commerce segments, partially offset by a decrease in the number of pairs sold in the teva brand, sanuk brand and ugg brand wholesale segments.  this resulted in an increase in the overall volume of footwear sold for all brands of 3.3% to approximately 6.2 million pairs sold for the three months ended march 31, 2014 from approximately 6.0 million pairs for the three months ended march 31, 2013.
35
wholesale net sales of our ugg brand increased primarily due to an increase in the weighted-average wholesale selling price, partially offset by a decrease in the volume of pairs sold.  the increase in average selling price was primarily due to a shift in product mix of cold weather shoe products that generally carry higher price points and higher average closeout prices.  for ugg wholesale net sales, the increase in average selling price had an impact of approximately $1,000 and the decrease in volume had an impact of approximately $500.
wholesale net sales of our teva brand decreased due to a decrease in the weighted-average wholesale selling price per pair as well as a decrease in volume of pairs sold.  the decrease in average selling price was primarily due to a shift in product mix.  for teva wholesale net sales, the decrease in average selling price had an impact of approximately $3,000 and the decrease in volume had an impact of approximately $2,000.
wholesale net sales of our sanuk brand decreased primarily due to a decrease in the volume of pairs sold outside the us as well as a decrease in the weighted-average wholesale selling price per pair, partially offset by an increase in the volume of pairs sold in the us. the decrease in average selling price was primarily due to increased closeout sales.  for sanuk wholesale net sales, the decrease in volume of pairs sold outside the us had an impact of approximately $3,000, the decrease in average selling price had an impact of approximately $2,000 and the increase in volume of pairs sold in the us had an impact of approximately $4,000.
wholesale net sales of our other brands increased due to an increase in the volume of pairs sold of approximately $8,500. the increase in volume was primarily due to the continued growth of the hoka brand. the change in average selling price had no material impact on sales.
net sales of our e-commerce business increased due to an increase in the number of pairs sold as well as an increase in the weighted-average selling price per pair. for e-commerce net sales, the increase in volume had an impact of approximately $8,000 and the increase in average selling price had an impact of approximately $2,000.
net sales of our retail store business, which are primarily ugg brand sales, increased largely due to the addition of 42 new stores opened since march 31, 2013, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  on a constant currency basis, net sales of our retail store business increased by 28.3% to approximately $82,000. over half of these new stores were in asia, primarily in china and japan, with the remaining new stores in the us and europe. same store sales for the thirteen weeks ended march 30, 2014 increased by 4.0% compared to the same period in 2013.  for retail same store sales, we experienced an increase in volume of approximately $4,000 partially offset by a decrease in weighted-average selling price of approximately $2,000. as we continue to increase the number of retail stores, each new store will have less significant impact on our growth rate.
international sales, which are included in the segment sales above, for all of our products combined increased by 18.9% for the three months ended march 31, 2014 as compared to the three months ended march 31, 2013, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. on a constant currency basis, international sales increased by 21.0% to approximately $98,000. international sales represented 32.7% and 30.7% of worldwide net sales for the three months ended march 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  the increase in international sales as a percentage of worldwide net sales was primarily due to the continued growth in our ugg brand's international retail and e-commerce business of approximately $16,000.
foreign loss before income taxes and worldwide loss before income taxes was $3,631 and $742, respectively, during the three months ended march 31, 2014, as compared to foreign income before income taxes and worldwide income before income taxes of $335 and $2,510, respectively, during the three months ended march 31, 2013. the change from foreign income before income taxes to a foreign loss before income taxes was primarily due to an increase in foreign operating expenses of approximately $14,000, which is primarily related to the expansion of our international retail and e-commerce operations. the increase in foreign operating expenses was partially offset by an increase in foreign gross margin of 2.2 percentage points, which was primarily related to the increase in international retail and e-commerce sales which generally carry higher margins than wholesale sales.
we expect that our foreign income before income taxes will continue to fluctuate from year to year based on several factors, including our expansion initiatives. in addition, we believe that the continued evolution and geographic scope of the ugg brand, our continuing strategy of enhancing product diversification, and our expected growth in our international retail and e-commerce business, will result in improved foreign operating results in future years.
gross profit.  as a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased compared to the same period in 2013 due to reduced sheepskin costs and increased use of uggpure, real wool woven into a durable backing used as an alternative to table grade sheepskin in select linings and foot beds, as well as an increased mix of retail and e-commerce sales, which generally carry higher
36
margins than our wholesale segments. the change in sales between our wholesale customers and distributors was immaterial to gross margin.
selling, general and administrative expenses.  the change in sg&a expenses was primarily due to:
•   increased retail costs of approximately $14,000, largely related to 42 new retail stores that were not open as of march 31, 2013 and related corporate infrastructure;
•   increased e-commerce costs of approximately $5,000, largely related to marketing and advertising, the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and increased expenses related to the international expansion of our e-commerce business; and
•   increased expenses of approximately $3,000 for marketing and promotions, largely related to the ugg and hoka brands.

we experienced a loss from operations during the three months ended march 31, 2014 compared to income from operations during the three months ended march 31, 2013 due to increased sg&a expenses as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by increased gross profit.  on a constant currency basis, income from operations decreased by 59.2% to approximately $1,000.
the slight decrease in income from operations of ugg brand wholesale was primarily the result of an increase in operating expenses of approximately $2,000 as well as the negative impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations of approximately $300, partially offset by a 2.0 percentage point increase in gross margin, primarily due to decreased sheepskin costs.
the decrease in income from operations of teva brand wholesale was primarily the result of a 5.8 percentage point decrease in gross margin as well as the decrease in net sales, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of approximately $1,000. the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a shift in sales mix as well as increased freight expense.
the decrease in income from operations of sanuk brand wholesale was primarily the result of the decrease in net sales, as well as increased operating expenses of approximately $1,000.
the decrease in loss from operations of our other brands wholesale was primarily the result of the increase in net sales as well as a 7.8 percentage point increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of approximately $2,000. the increase in sales and gross margin is largely due to the continued growth of the hoka brand which generally carries higher margins than the other brands included in this segment.
the increase in income from operations of our e-commerce business was primarily due to the increase in net sales as well as a 5.7 percentage point increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of approximately $5,000. the increase in gross margin was largely due to the reduced sheepskin costs related to our ugg brand products. the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased expenses related to marketing and advertising, the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased expenses related to the international expansion of our e-commerce business.
37
income from operations of our retail store business, which primarily relates to the ugg brand, decreased primarily due to increased operating expenses of approximately $14,000 largely related to our new store openings and related corporate infrastructure, as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $1,000.  these results were partially offset by increased gross profit of approximately $12,000.
unallocated overhead costs were comparable to the same period in 2013.
other expense, net.  the increase in other expense, net was primarily due to expenses related to our credit facilities.
income taxes. income taxes for the three months ended march 31, 2014 are computed using the actual tax rate for the transition period (see note 1 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in part iv of this annual report for an explanation of our change in fiscal year). income taxes for the three months ended march 31, 2013 were computed using the effective tax rate estimated to be applicable for the full fiscal year ended december 31, 2013. income tax expense and effective income tax rates were as follows:
three months ended march 31,
2014                                                         2013 (unaudited)
income tax expense               $1,943                        $1,503
effective income tax rate        (261.9     )%   59.9                       %
we recognized income tax expense of $1,943 on a pre-tax loss of $742 for the three months ended march 31, 2014 compared to income tax expense of $1,503 on pre-tax earnings of $2,510 for the three months ended march 31, 2013. the income tax expense of $1,943 primarily relates to taxable income in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions during the three months ended march 31, 2014.  the pre-tax loss of $742 includes the loss of a foreign subsidiary in a jurisdiction with no corporate income tax, therefore providing no tax benefit from the loss that was recognized.
net (loss) income.  we experienced a net loss for the three months ended march 31, 2014 compared to net income for the three months ended march 31, 2013 as a result of the items discussed above. as a result of the net loss for the three months ended march 31, 2014, we recognized a loss per share compared to diluted earnings per share during the three months ended march 31, 2013.

overview.    the increase in net sales was primarily due to increased ugg brand sales through our retail stores and e-commerce sites. in addition, net sales increased from our other brands, sanuk brand and teva brand sales through our wholesale channel, and increased sanuk brand sales through our e-commerce sites and retail stores. the increase in income from operations resulted from increased sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher sg&a expenses.

the increase in net sales was primarily due to increased ugg brand sales through our retail stores and e-commerce sites. in addition, net sales increased from our other brands, sanuk brand and teva brand sales through our wholesale channel and increased sanuk brand sales through our e-commerce sites and retail stores. on a constant currency basis, net sales increased by 11.1% to approximately $1,571,000. we experienced an increase in the number of pairs sold in all segments. this resulted in a 10.1% overall increase in the volume of footwear sold for all brands and channels to approximately 26.1 million pairs for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to approximately 23.7 million pairs for 2012. our weighted-average wholesale selling price per pair decreased to $46.87 for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $49.17 for 2012. the decreased average selling price was primarily due to our ugg, teva and sanuk wholesale segments, partially offset by an increase in the average selling price in our other brands wholesale segment. our overall weighted-average selling price per pair across all channels decreased to $59.63
39
for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $60.12 for 2012. the decrease in overall average selling price per pair was primarily due to the decreased weightedaverage wholesale selling price per pair, partially offset by the increased mix of direct-to-consumer sales which carry higher price points.
wholesale net sales of our ugg brand decreased primarily due to a decrease in the weighted-average wholesale selling price per pair as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by an increase in the volume of pairs sold. on a constant currency basis, wholesale sales of our ugg brand increased by 0.6% to approximately $824,000. the decrease in average selling price was primarily due to increased closeout sales at a lower price, as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. for ugg wholesale net sales, the decrease in average selling price had an estimated impact of approximately $28,000, including approximately $6,000 related to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by an increase in volume of approximately $27,000.
wholesale net sales of our teva brand increased primarily due to an increase in the volume of pairs sold, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted-average wholesale selling price per pair. the decrease in average selling price was largely due to a higher proportion of the sales coming from sandals which carry lower average selling prices. for teva wholesale net sales, the increase in volume had an estimated impact of approximately $4,000 and the decrease in average selling price had an estimated impact of approximately $3,000.
wholesale net sales of our sanuk brand increased primarily due to an increase in the volume of pairs sold, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted-average wholesale selling price per pair. the decrease in average selling price was primarily due to an increased impact of closeout sales. for sanuk wholesale net sales, the increase in volume had an estimated impact of approximately $10,000 and the decrease in average selling price had an estimated impact of approximately $5,000.
wholesale net sales of our other brands increased due to an increase in the weighted-average wholesale selling price per pair, as well as an increase in the volume of pairs sold. the increase in average selling price was primarily due to the addition of the hoka brand, which carries higher average selling prices than the other brands included in this segment. the increase in volume of pairs sold was primarily due to the addition of the hoka brand. hoka sales are included from our acquisition date of september 27, 2012 and, therefore, comparable sales amounts are not included in the sales for the year ended december 31, 2012. excluding the hoka brand, our other brands' wholesale net sales increased by approximately $4,000 due to an increase in sales of approximately $5,000 from an increase in the volume of pairs sold, partially offset by a decrease in sales of approximately $1,000 due to a decrease in the average selling price. the decrease in average selling price was primarily due to the increased impact of closeout sales.
net sales of our e-commerce business increased due to an increase in the volume of pairs sold primarily attributable to the ugg brand. for e-commerce net sales, the increase in volume had an impact of approximately $39,000. the change in average selling price had no material impact on net sales.
net sales of our retail store business, which are primarily ugg brand sales, increased largely due to the addition of 40 new stores opened since december 31, 2012, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. on a constant currency basis, net sales of our retail store business increased by 36.4% to approximately $335,000. over half of the new stores were in asia, primarily in china and japan, with the remaining new stores in the us and europe. same store sales for the 52 weeks ending december 29, 2013 increased 2.8% compared to the same period in 2012. for retail same store sales, we experienced an increase in volume of approximately $4,500 partially offset by a decrease in weighted-average selling price of approximately $500. as we continue to increase the number of retail stores, each new store will have less significant impact on our growth rate.
international sales, which are included in the segment sales above, for all of our products combined increased by 16.5% for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2012, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. on a constant currency basis, international sales increased by 19.9% to approximately $529,000. international sales represented 33.0% and 31.2% of worldwide net sales for the year ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in international sales as a percentage of worldwide net sales was largely due to the continued growth in our ugg brand's international retail and e-commerce business of approximately $65,000, as well as increased sales to our distributors throughout asia and latin america of approximately $8,000 and wholesale customers in france of approximately $7,000, partially offset by decreased sales to our distributors in canada and europe of approximately $11,000.
foreign income before income taxes was $60,851 and $51,409, and worldwide income before income taxes was $205,557 and $184,118 for the year ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. foreign income before income taxes represented 29.6% and 27.9% of worldwide income before income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in foreign income before income taxes as a percentage of worldwide income before income taxes was primarily due to a 16.5% international sales growth rate compared to a 7.1% us sales growth rate, as well as an increase in gross margin earned
40
on foreign sales. these increases were primarily related to the increase in international retail and e-commerce sales which generally carry higher margins than wholesale sales.
we expect that our foreign income before income taxes will continue to fluctuate from year to year based on several factors, including our expansion initiatives. in addition, we believe that the continued evolution and geographic scope of the ugg brand and our continuing strategy of enhancing product diversification will contribute to growth in our international retail and e-commerce business in future years.
gross profit.    as a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased in the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. gross profit increased by approximately 1.5 percentage points due to reduced sheepskin costs and increased use of uggpure, real wool woven into a durable backing used as an alternative to table grade sheepskin in select linings and foot beds, as well as an increased mix of retail and e-commerce sales, which generally carry higher margins than our wholesale segments, of approximately 1.2 percentage points. these increases were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of approximately 30 basis points. the change in sales between our wholesale customers and distributors is immaterial to gross margin. our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, and we expect our gross margin to increase for the full year 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to realizing a full year of reduced sheepskin prices, the increased use of uggpure and an increase in the proportion of direct-to-consumer sales which generally carry higher margins.
selling, general and administrative expenses.    sg&a expenses increased primarily from:
•   increased retail costs of approximately $53,000 largely related to 40 new retail stores that were not open as of december 31, 2012 and related corporate infrastructure;
•   increased recognition of performance-based compensation of approximately $17,000;
•   increased e-commerce expenses of approximately $13,000 largely related to increased marketing and advertising; and
•   increased expenses of approximately $9,000 for the hoka brand which we acquired on september 27, 2012.
these increases were partially offset by decreased expense related to the fair value of the sanuk contingent consideration liability of approximately $8,000 primarily due to changes made during 2012 to the brand's forecast of sales and gross profit through 2015, which increased the expense in 2012 without a comparable increase in 2013.
performance-based compensation as noted above, the recognition of performance-based compensation increased by approximately $17,000 for the year ended december 31, 2013 over the prior year period. as of december 31, 2013, the target level of the performance objectives relating to our 2013 performance-based cash awards was achieved, and we have recognized the expense accordingly. in contrast, as of december 31, 2012, we did not achieve the same level of the performance objectives relating to our 2012 performance-based cash awards and we recognized expense for those 2012 awards accordingly at that time.
at the beginning of each year, our compensation committee reviews our operating results from the prior fiscal year, as well as the financial and strategic plan for the next fiscal year and for subsequent years. the committee then establishes specific annual company financial goals and specific strategic goals for each executive. performance-based cash compensation awards for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2012 were only partially earned, and performance-based cash compensation awards for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2013 were earned at higher levels, based on our achievement of certain targets for annual ebitda, as well as achievement of pre-determined individual financial and non-financial performance goals that are tailored to individual employees based on their role and responsibilities at the company. the performance objectives and goals, as well as the targets, differ each year and are based upon many factors, including the company's current business stage and strategies, recent company financial and operating performance, expected growth rates over prior year's performance, business and general economic conditions and market and peer group analysis. for example, in evaluating targets for the 2012 fiscal year, our compensation committee reviewed, among other things, our ebitda for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2011, which was approximately $314.6 million, and, in evaluating targets for the 2013 fiscal year, our compensation committee reviewed, among other things, our ebitda for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2012, which was approximately $229.7 million. performance objectives for the 2013 fiscal year were based, in part, upon the expected achievement of growth in the company's ebitda for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the company's ebitda for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2012. while expected growth rates over prior year performance were not reduced, the company's lower ebitda for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2012 as compared to the fiscal year ended december 31, 2011 resulted in 2013 ebitda targets that were lower than the 2012 ebitda targets.
41
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we recognize performance-based compensation expenses when it is deemed probable that the applicable performance-based goal will be met. we evaluate the probability of achieving performance-based goals on a quarterly basis. our assessment of the probability of achieving specified goals can fluctuate from quarter to quarter as we assess our projected achievement as compared to specified performance targets. as a result, the compensation expense we recognize may also fluctuate from period to period.

income from operations increased due to the increase in sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher sg&a expenses and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. on a constant currency basis, income from operations increased by 13.7% to approximately $213,000.
the increase in income from operations of ugg brand wholesale was primarily the result of a 2.1 percentage point increase in gross margin primarily related to decreased sheepskin costs of approximately $18,000, as well as reduced operating expenses of approximately $2,000, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. on a constant currency basis, income from operations of ugg brand wholesale increased 11.0% to approximately $229,000.
income from operations of teva brand wholesale was comparable to the same period in 2012.
the increase in income from operations of sanuk brand wholesale was primarily the result of decreased expense related to the fair value of the sanuk contingent consideration liability of approximately $8,000, which was primarily due to changes made during 2012 to the brand's forecast of sales and gross profit through 2015, which increased the expense in 2012 without a comparable increase in 2013. in addition, income from operations increased due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by a 1.4 percentage point decrease in gross margin due to increased closeout sales as well as an increase in sales expenses of approximately $2,000.
the increase in loss from operations of our other brands wholesale was primarily the result of the activity of our hoka brand, which we purchased on september 27, 2012, and includes initial costs to expand the brand.
the increase in income from operations of our e-commerce business was primarily the result of the increase in net sales and resulting gross profit, partially offset by increased operating expenses of approximately $15,000. the increased operating expenses were largely due to increased marketing and advertising costs.
income from operations of our retail store business, which primarily involves the ugg brand, increased due to the increase in net sales, largely offset by increased operating expenses of approximately $53,000 primarily attributable to 40 new stores opened during the year as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. on a constant currency basis, income from operations of our retail store business increased 7.9% to approximately $68,000.
the increase in unallocated overhead costs resulted most significantly from an increase of approximately $8,000 in the recognition of performance-based compensation that was not allocated to any of our reportable segments.
42
other expense, net.    other expense, net decreased primarily due to a decrease in interest expense related to our short-term borrowings.
income taxes.    income tax expense and effective income tax rates were as follows:
years ended december 31,
2013                                                           2012
income tax expense            $59,868                 $55,104
effective income tax rate        29.1     %              29.9     %
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in our annual foreign income before income tax as a percentage of worldwide income before income tax, as income generated in the foreign jurisdictions is taxed at significantly lower rates than the us. for the full year 2013, we generated approximately 11.0% of our earnings before income tax from a country which does not impose a corporate income tax.
net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest.    prior to april 2, 2012, we owned 51% of a joint venture with an affiliate of stella international holdings limited (stella international) for the primary purpose of opening and operating retail stores for the ugg brand in china. stella international is also one of our major manufacturers in china. on april 2, 2012, we purchased the 49% noncontrolling interest owned by stella international for a total purchase price of $20,000. prior to this purchase, we already had a controlling interest in this entity, and therefore, the subsidiary had been and continues to be consolidated with our operations.
net income attributable to deckers outdoor corporation.    our net income increased as a result of the items discussed above. our diluted earnings per share increased primarily as a result of the increase in net income, as well as by a reduced number of diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. the reduction in the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding was the result of our share repurchases which commenced during the year ended december 31, 2012. the weighted-average impact of the share repurchases was a reduction of approximately 2,600,000 shares.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have off-balance sheet arrangements.
liquidity and capital resources we finance our working capital and operating needs using a combination of our cash and cash equivalents balances, cash generated from operations, and as needed, the credit available under our credit agreement. in an economic recession or under other adverse economic conditions, our cash generated from operations may decline, and we may be unable to realize a return on our cash and cash equivalents, secure additional credit on favorable terms, or renew or access our existing credit. these factors may impact our working capital reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business.
our cash flow cycle includes the purchase of or deposits for raw materials, the purchase of inventories, the subsequent sale of the inventories, and the eventual collection of the resulting accounts receivable. as a result, our working capital requirements begin when we purchase, or make deposits on, raw materials and inventories and continue until we ultimately collect the resulting receivables. the seasonality of our ugg brand business requires us to build fall and winter inventories in the quarters ending june 30 and september 30 to support sales for the ugg brand's major selling seasons, which historically occur during the quarters ending september 30 and december 31; whereas, the teva and sanuk brands build inventory levels beginning in the quarters ending december 31 and march 31 in anticipation of the spring selling season that occurs in the quarters ending march 31 and june 30. given the seasonality of our ugg, teva, and sanuk brands, our working capital requirements fluctuate significantly throughout the year. the cash required to fund these working capital fluctuations has been provided using our internal cash flows and short-term borrowings. we borrow funds under our credit agreement as needed.
the following table summarizes our cash flows:

cash from operating activities.  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended march 31, 2015 resulted primarily from net income and an increase in trade accounts payable, long-term liabilities and accrued expenses. the increase in long-term liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deferred rent. the increase in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases and payments. the increase in long-term liabilities was primarily related to non-current tax liabilities. these increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by increases in trade accounts receivable, inventories, income tax receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets. the increase in trade accounts receivable was primarily related to increased wholesale sales in the three months ended march 31, 2015 as compared to the three months ended march 31, 2014.  the increase in inventory was primarily related to efforts to manage inventory levels relative to expected future sales and the timing of our inventory purchases and payments. the increase in income tax receivable was primarily related to estimated tax payments made in prior periods. the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to deposits for future leather purchases. net working capital increased as of march 31, 2015 from december 31, 2013, primarily as a result of lower trade accounts payable and lower income taxes payable, partially offset by lower other current assets, lower trade accounts receivable and lower inventories. changes in working capital are due to the items discussed above, as well as our normal seasonality and timing of cash receipts and cash payments.
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2013 resulted primarily from net income, a decrease in inventories, and increases in accrued expenses, income taxes payable and trade accounts payable. the decrease in inventories was primarily related to efforts to manage inventory levels relative to expected future sales and the timing of our inventory purchases and payments. the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to larger payroll accruals, including performance-based compensation for the year ended december 31, 2013 versus 2012, as well as increased value added tax (vat) accruals. the increase in income taxes payable was due to the increase in earnings. the increase in trade accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases and payments. these increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. the increase in prepaid and other current assets was primarily due to deposits paid in accordance with our contracts to purchase sheepskin. net working capital increased as of december 31, 2013 from december 31, 2012, primarily as a result of higher cash and cash equivalents balances and higher prepaid and other current assets, partially offset by higher other current liabilities, lower inventories and higher accounts payable. changes in working capital are due to the items discussed above, as well as our normal seasonality and timing of cash receipts and cash payments.
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2012 resulted primarily from net income, a decrease in prepaid and other current assets and an increase in trade accounts payable. the decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to refunds of deposits received in accordance with our contracts to purchase sheepskin. the increase in trade accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases and payments. these increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by an increase in inventories. the increase in inventories was primarily related to expected future sales and the timing of our inventory purchases and payments. net working capital decreased as of december 31, 2012 from december 31, 2011, primarily as a result of lower cash and prepaid and other current assets, and increased short-term borrowings and accounts payable, partially offset by higher inventories. changes in working capital are due to the items discussed above, as well as our normal seasonality and timing of cash receipts and cash payments.
wholesale accounts receivable turnover and inventory turnover both improved in the twelve months ended march 31, 2015 compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2013, and did not have a material impact on our liquidity.

cash from investing activities.  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended march 31, 2015 resulted primarily from the purchases of property and equipment and purchase of intangibles. the capital expenditures were primarily related to infrastructure improvements to support our omnichannel transformation and international expansion, the build out of our distribution center and retail stores, and purchases of computer hardware and software. the purchase of intangible and other assets, net was related to the acquisition of our ugg brand distributor that sold to retailers in germany.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2013 resulted primarily from the purchases of property and equipment. the capital expenditures included the build out of our new corporate facilities and retail stores, and purchases of computer hardware and software. the new corporate facilities replaced several leased spaces.
for the year ended december 31, 2012, net cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from the purchases of property and equipment, as well as our acquisitions of the hoka brand and an intangible asset for lease rights for a retail store location in france. capital expenditures in fiscal year 2012 included the build out of new retail stores and our corporate facilities.
as of march 31, 2015, we had approximately $8,000 of material commitments for future capital expenditures primarily related to equipment costs of our new distribution center. we estimate that the capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 including
44
the aforementioned commitments will range from approximately $65,000 to $70,000. we anticipate these expenditures will primarily include information technology and related infrastructure improvements to support our omnichannel transformation and international expansion, the build out of our retail stores and equipment costs of our new distribution center. the actual amount of capital expenditures for the year may differ from this estimate, largely depending on the timing of new store openings or any unforeseen needs to replace existing assets and the timing of other expenditures.
cash from financing activities.    for the year ended march 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from repayments of short-term borrowings and cash paid for repurchases of common stock. this was partially offset by short-term borrowings provided by our lines of credit and funding received from the mortgage obtained on our corporate headquarters property.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, net cash used in financing activities was comprised primarily of repayments of short-term borrowings, as well as contingent consideration paid related to our sanuk acquisition. the cash used was partially offset by cash from our short-term borrowings.
for the year ended december 31, 2012, net cash used in financing activities was comprised primarily of repayments of short-term borrowings and repurchases of our common stock, as well as contingent consideration paid related to our sanuk acquisition, and the purchase of the remaining 49% noncontrolling interest in our joint venture with stella international. the cash used was partially offset by cash from our short-term borrowings.
in june 2012, the company approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $200,000 of the company's common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. the program did not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may have been suspended at any time at the company's discretion. as of february 28, 2015, the company had repurchased approximately 3,823,000 shares under this program, for approximately $200,000, or an average price of $52.31 per share. as of february 28, 2015, the company had repurchased the full amount authorized under this program.
in january 2015, the company approved a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $200,000 of the company's common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. the program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at the company's discretion. as of march 31, 2015, the company has repurchased approximately 377,000 shares under this program for approximately $27,900, or an average price of $74.09 per share, leaving the remaining approved amount at $172,100.
in august 2011 we entered into a credit agreement (credit agreement) with jpmorgan chase bank, national association (jpmorgan) as the administrative agent, comerica bank (comerica) and hsbc bank usa, national association (hsbc), as co-syndication agents, and the lenders party thereto.  in august 2012, we amended and restated the credit agreement in its entirety(amended and restated credit agreement).  in june 2013, we amended the amended and restated credit agreement to permit additional borrowings in china of $12,500 and revised certain financial covenants including an increase in the maximum amount permitted to be spent on the headquarters building from $75,000 to $80,000. in august 2013, one of our subsidiaries entered into a new credit agreement in china (china credit facility).  in november 2014, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with jpmorgan as the administrative agent, comerica and hsbc as co-syndication agents, and the lenders party thereto. the second amended and restated credit agreement amends and restates, in its entirety, the amended and restated credit agreement. the second amended and restated credit agreement is a five-year, $400,000 secured revolving credit facility. refer to note 5 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in part iv of this annual report for further information on our second amended and restated credit agreement and china credit facility.  at march 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under the second amended and restated credit agreement and outstanding letters of credit of approximately $100, leaving an unused balance of approximately $399,900 under the second amended and restated credit agreement.  at march 31, 2015, we had approximately $4,900 of outstanding borrowings under the china credit facility. as of march 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants and we remain in compliance as of june 1, 2015.
in july 2014, we obtained a mortgage on our corporate headquarters property for approximately $33,900.  at march 31, 2015 the outstanding balance under the mortgage is $33,600. the mortgage has a fixed interest rate of 4.928%.  payments include interest and principal in an amount that will amortize the principal balance over a 30-year period. minimum principal payments over the next 5 years are approximately $2,700. the loan will mature and have a balloon payment due in 15 years of approximately $23,400.  the loan will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. in december 2014 the mortgage financial covenants were amended to be consistent with the financial covenants of the second amended and restated credit agreement.
contractual obligations.    the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at march 31, 2015 and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods.

(1)   our operating lease obligations consist primarily of building leases for our retail locations, distribution centers, and regional offices, and include the cash lease payments of deferred rents.
(2)   our purchase obligations consist mostly of open purchase orders. they also include capital expenditures, service contracts and promotional expenses. outstanding purchase orders are primarily with our third-party manufacturers and are expected to be paid within one year. these are outstanding open orders and not minimum purchase obligations. our promotional expenditures and service contracts are due periodically through fiscal years 2016 and 2017.
we have also entered into minimum purchase commitments with certain suppliers (see note 6 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in part iv of this annual report). certain of the agreements require that we advance specified minimum payment amounts. we have included the total remaining cash commitments under these agreements, net of deposits, as of march 31, 2015 in this table. we expect our sheepskin purchases will eventually exceed the minimum commitment levels; therefore we believe the deposits will become fully refundable, and thus, we believe this will not materially affect our results of operations, as it is in the normal course of our business.
(3)   our mortgage obligation consists of a mortgage secured by our corporate headquarters property. the mortgage has a fixed interest rate of 4.928%. payments include interest and principal in an amount that amortizes the principal balance over a 30-year period, however the loan will mature and have a balloon payment due in 15 years of approximately $23,400. for a further discussion, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in part iv of this annual report.
(4)   our contingent consideration obligations consist of estimated contingent consideration payments for the acquisitions of the sanuk and hoka brands. for additional information, see the "commitments and contingencies" section below and notes 1 and 6 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in part iv of this annual report.
(5)   the unrecognized tax benefits are related to uncertain tax positions taken in our income tax return that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. see note 4 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in part iv of this annual report.
commitments and contingencies.    the following reflect the additional commitments and contingent liabilities that may have a material impact on liquidity and cash flow in future periods.
in july 2011, the company acquired the sanuk brand, and the total purchase price included contingent consideration payments.  as of march 31, 2015, the remaining contingent consideration payment, which has no maximum, is 40.0% of the sanuk brand gross profit in calendar year 2015 and is to be paid within 60 days following the end of the performance period. estimated contingent consideration payments of approximately $24,200 are included within other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet as of march 31, 2015, and are not included in the table above. see note 6 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in part iv of this annual report.
the purchase price for the hoka brand, acquired in september 2012, also includes contingent consideration through 2017, with a maximum of $2,000, of which approximately $500 has been paid. estimated future contingent consideration payments of approximately $1,500 are included within other accrued expenses and long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of march 31, 2015, and are not included in the table above. see note 6 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in part iv of this annual report.

we believe that cash generated from operations, the available borrowings under our existing second amended and restated credit agreement, and our cash and cash equivalents will provide sufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. however, risks and uncertainties that could impact our ability to maintain or grow our cash position include our earnings growth rate, the continued strength of our brands, our ability to respond to changes in consumer preferences, our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner, our ability to effectively manage our inventories, our ability to generate returns on our acquisitions of businesses, and market volatility, among others. see part i, item 1a, "risk factors" for a discussion of additional factors that may affect our cash position and liquidity. furthermore, we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. if these sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell debt securities or additional equity securities or to obtain a new credit agreement or draw on our existing second amended and restated credit agreement. the sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. the incurrence of indebtedness would result in incurring debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. in addition, there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. although there are no other material present understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to the acquisition of any other businesses, we may evaluate acquisitions of other businesses or brands.
impact of inflation we believe that the rates of inflation in the three most recent fiscal years have not had a significant impact on our net sales or profitability.
critical accounting policies and estimates refer to note 1 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in part iv of this annual report for a discussion of our significant accounting policies. those policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our accompanying consolidated financial statements in part iv of this annual report are revenue recognition; use of estimates, which includes the below reserves and allowances; inventories; accounting for long-lived assets; goodwill and other intangible assets; fair value of contingent consideration; and stock compensation.
use of estimates.    the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts during the reporting period. management reasonably could use different estimates and assumptions, and changes in estimates and assumptions could occur from period to period, with the result in each case being a potential material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. we have historically been materially accurate in our estimates used for the reserves and allowances below.
the following table summarizes data related to the critical accounting estimates for accounts receivable allowances and reserves, which are discussed below:

allowance for doubtful accounts.    we provide a reserve against trade accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from customers' inability to pay. we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts,
47
aged trade accounts receivables, economic conditions and forecasts, historical experience and the customers' credit-worthiness. trade accounts receivable that are subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve. the reserve includes specific reserves for accounts, which all or a portion of are identified as potentially uncollectible, plus a non-specific reserve for the balance of accounts based on our historical loss experience. reserves have been established for all projected losses of this nature. our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results. for example, a 1.0% change in the rate used to estimate the reserve for the accounts we consider to have credit risk and are not specifically identified as uncollectible would change the allowance for doubtful accounts at march 31, 2015 by approximately $1,000.
allowance for sales discounts.    a significant portion of our wholesale sales and resulting trade accounts receivable reflects a discount that our customers may take, generally based upon meeting certain order, shipment and payment timelines. we use the amount of the discounts that are available to be taken against the period-end trade accounts receivable to estimate and record a corresponding reserve for sales discounts.
allowance for estimated chargebacks.    when our wholesale customers pay their invoices, they often take deductions for chargebacks against their invoices, which are often valid. therefore, we record an allowance for the balance of chargebacks that are outstanding in our accounts receivable balance as of the end of each period, along with an estimated reserve for chargebacks that have not yet been taken against outstanding accounts receivable balances. this estimate is based on historical trends of the timing and amount of chargebacks taken against invoices.
allowance for estimated returns and estimated returns liability.    we record an allowance for anticipated future returns of goods shipped prior to period end and a liability for anticipated returns of goods sold direct to consumers. in general, we accept returns for damaged or defective products. we also have a policy whereby we accept returns from our retail and e-commerce customers for a thirty day period. we base the amounts of the allowance and liability on any approved customer requests for returns, historical returns experience, and any recent events that could result in a change from historical returns rates, among other factors. the allowance for estimated returns as a percentage of net sales was comparable to the same period in the prior year. our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results. for example, a 1.0% change in the rate used to estimate the percentage of sales expected to ultimately be returned would change the allowance and liability reserves for returns in total at march 31, 2015 by approximately $2,000. our historical estimates for returns have been reasonably accurate.
inventory write-downs.    we review the various items in inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete, and impaired inventory. in doing so, we write the inventory down to the lower of cost or expected future net selling prices. inventories were stated at $238,911, $211,519 and $260,791 net of inventory write-downs of $3,601, $4,843 and $6,142 at march 31, 2015, march 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. the decrease in inventory write-downs at march 31, 2015 compared to march 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 was primarily due to lower write-downs of certain ugg and other brand styles that are not being continued. the amount of inventory write-downs as a percentage of inventory were 1.5%, 2.2% and 2.4% as of march 31, 2015, march 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results. for example, a 10.0% change in the estimated selling prices of our potentially obsolete inventory would change the inventory write-down reserve at march 31, 2015 by approximately $1,000.
valuation of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets.    we assess the impairment of goodwill, intangible, and other long-lived assets on a separate asset basis based on assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying amount of these assets individually.
we performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets. we evaluated our ugg, sanuk and other brands' goodwill and our teva trademarks. based on the carrying amounts of the ugg, teva, sanuk and other brands' goodwill, trademarks, and net assets, the brands' fiscal year 2015 sales and operating results, and the brands' long-term forecasts of sales and operating results as of their evaluation dates, we concluded that the carrying amounts of the ugg, sanuk and other brands' goodwill, as well as the teva trademarks, were not impaired. our teva trademarks were evaluated under accounting standards update, testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, and we concluded, based on an evaluation of all relevant qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, financial performance, entity-specific events, and legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors, that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the teva trademarks is less than its carrying amount, and accordingly we did not perform a quantitative impairment test for the teva trademarks. our goodwill balance at march 31, 2015 represents goodwill in the ugg, sanuk and other brands' reporting units. we believe that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the ugg reporting unit's fair value and the other brands' reporting units' fair value are less than their respective carrying values. the ugg and other brands' goodwill was evaluated based on qualitative analyses.
we performed a qualitative analysis of the sanuk reporting unit's fair value as of october 31, 2014, and concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit's fair value was less than the carrying value, and, therefore, no additional sensitivity analysis was performed.
48
we also evaluated amortizable long-lived assets, including intangible assets as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013. during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015, we recorded immaterial impairment losses for four of our retail stores for which the fair values did not exceed their carrying values. as of december 31, 2013, we recorded immaterial impairment losses for three of our retail stores for which the fair values did not exceed their carrying values. our other valuation methodologies used as of march 31, 2015 did not change from the prior years.
fair value of contingent consideration.    we have entered into contingent consideration arrangements when we have acquired brands. the fair value of our sanuk brand contingent consideration is material and highly subjective. it is based on estimated future sales, gross profits, and discount rates, among other variables and estimates (see note 1 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in part iv of this annual report). these are evaluated each reporting period and the contingent consideration is adjusted accordingly. our estimated revenue forecasts include a compound annual growth rate of 14.6% from calendar year 2014 through calendar year 2015, the final year of the contingent consideration arrangement. our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results. for example, a 5.0% change in the estimated compound annual growth rate would change the total liability balance at march 31, 2015 by approximately $2,000.

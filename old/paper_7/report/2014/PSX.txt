business environment and executive overview phillips 66 is an energy manufacturing and logistics company with midstream, chemicals, refining, and marketing and specialties businesses. at december 31, 2014, we had total assets of $48.7 billion.
the separation on april 4, 2012, the conocophillips board of directors approved the separation of its downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company named phillips 66. in accordance with the separation and distribution agreement, the two companies were separated by conocophillips distributing to its stockholders all 625,272,302 shares of common stock of phillips 66 after the market closed on april 30, 2012 (the separation). each conocophillips stockholder received one share of phillips 66 stock for every two shares of conocophillips stock. following the separation, conocophillips retained no ownership interest in phillips 66, and each company has separate public ownership, boards of directors and management.
executive overview in 2014, we reported earnings of $4.8 billion, generated $3.5 billion in cash from operating activities, and received $1.2 billion from asset dispositions, primarily reflecting the sale of our interest in the malaysian refining company sdn. bdh. (mrc) and a special distribution from wrb refining. we used available cash primarily to fund capital expenditures and investments of $3.8 billion, pay dividends of $1.1 billion, repurchase $2.3 billion of our common stock and finance $450 million of the phillips specialty products inc. (pspi) share exchange. we issued $2.5 billion of debt, and ended 2014 with $5.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $4.9 billion of total capacity under our available liquidity facilities.

index to financial statements we continue to focus on the following strategic priorities:
•   maintain strong operating excellence. safety and reliability are our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. continuous improvement in safety, environmental stewardship, reliability and cost efficiency is a fundamental requirement for our company and employees. we employ rigorous training and audit programs to drive ongoing improvement in both personal and process safety as we strive for zero incidents. since we cannot control commodity prices, controlling operating expenses and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. we actively monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management. we are committed to protecting the environment and strive to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our operations. optimizing utilization rates at our refineries through reliable and safe operations enables us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. during 2014, our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 94 percent, compared with 93 percent in 2013.
•   deliver profitable growth. we have budgeted $4.6 billion in capital expenditures and investments in 2015. including our share of expected capital spending by joint ventures dcp midstream, llc (dcp midstream), chevron phillips chemical company (cpchem) and wrb, our total 2015 capital program is expected to be $6.7 billion. this program is designed primarily to grow our midstream and chemicals segments, which have planned expansions for manufacturing and logistics capacity. the need for additional new gathering and processing, pipeline, storage and distribution infrastructure-driven by domestic unconventional crude oil, natural gas liquids (ngl) and natural gas production-is creating capital investment opportunities in our midstream business. over the next few years, cpchem plans significant reinvestment of its earnings to build additional processing capacity benefiting from lower-cost ngl feedstocks. we continue to focus on funding the most attractive growth opportunities across our portfolio.
in 2013, we formed phillips 66 partners, a master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum product and ngl pipelines and terminals, as well as other transportation and midstream assets. its assets consist of crude oil and refined petroleum product pipeline, terminal and storage systems in the central and gulf coast regions of the united states, as well as two crude oil rail-unloading facilities located at or adjacent to our bayway and ferndale refineries.
•   enhance returns. we plan to improve refining returns through greater use of advantaged feedstocks, disciplined capital allocation and portfolio optimization. we expect to drive higher returns in marketing and specialties (m&amp;s) by selling finished products to higher-margin export markets. a disciplined capital allocation process ensures that we focus investments in projects that generate competitive returns throughout the business cycle. during 2014, 94 percent of the company's u.s. crude slate was advantaged, compared with 74 percent in 2013.
•   grow shareholder distributions. we believe shareholder value is enhanced through, among other things, consistent and ongoing growth of regular dividends, supplemented by share repurchases. we increased our dividend rate by 28 percent during 2014, and it has more than doubled since the separation. regular dividends demonstrate the confidence our management has in our capital structure and its capability to generate free cash flow throughout the business cycle. cumulatively through december 31, 2014, we have repurchased $4.9 billion, or approximately 73.2 million shares, of our common stock. at the discretion of our board of directors, we plan to increase dividends annually and fund our share repurchase program while continuing to invest in the growth of our business.
•   build on a high-performing organization. we strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. throughout the company, we focus on getting results in the right way and believe success is both what we do and how we do it. we encourage collaboration throughout our company, while valuing differences, respecting diversity of thought, and creating a great place to work. we foster an environment of learning and development through structured programs focused on building functional and technical skills where employees are engaged in our business and committed to their own, as well as the company's, success.
33
index to financial statements business environment the midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in dcp midstream. earnings of dcp midstream are closely linked to ngl prices, natural gas prices and crude oil prices. industry ngl annual average prices decreased from 2012 to 2013 and again from 2013 to 2014, due to relatively higher inventories driven by growing ngl production from liquids-rich shale plays with limited corresponding domestic demand increase from the petrochemical industry and constrained export capacity. natural gas prices increased from 2012 to 2013, and continued to increase from 2013 to 2014. the increase in both periods reflected concerns over increasingly lower industry inventory levels, due to steep inventory draws in 2013 and 2014, as well as domestic pipeline constraints.
the chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in cpchem. the chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors. the chemicals and plastics industry continued to experience higher ethylene margins in regions of the world where production is based upon ngl versus crude-derived feedstocks. in particular, companies with north american ethane-based crackers benefited from the lower-priced feedstocks and improved ethylene margins, as well as improved margins for polyethylene and other ethylene derivatives.
results for our refining segment depend largely on refining margins, cost control, refinery throughput, and product yields. the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil, and it is used within our industry as an indicator for refining margins. the u.s. 3:2:1 crack spread (three barrels of crude oil producing two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of diesel) decreased from 2012 to 2013. however, for the first three quarters of 2014, the u.s. crack spread improved over 2013, primarily resulting from increased access to advantaged crude runs and a decrease in imports. midcontinent refiners were especially strong, which was attributed to the region's crude feedstock advantage. the decrease in u.s. crack spreads during the fourth quarter of 2014 was significant enough to drive the annual domestic industry average for 2014 lower than 2013. this decrease was largely due to gasoline prices falling faster than crude prices, resulting in a tighter margin.
u.s. crude production continues to increase and nationwide growth is benefiting from slower decline rates in legacy production areas, as well as improved drilling efficiency. limited infrastructure for takeaway options resulted in favorable feedstock prices for u.s. refiners with access to advantaged crudes. midcontinent refiners were especially advantaged. sustained pressure on inventories and lack of local gathering infrastructure in the midcontinent caused west texas intermediate (wti) crude to continue trading at a discount relative to crudes such as light louisiana sweet (lls) and brent during 2014. refineries capable of processing wti crude and crude oils that price relative to wti, primarily the midcontinent and gulf coast refineries, benefited from these lower regional feedstock prices. the spread between wti and brent narrowed considerably over the year, stemming from increased pipeline outlets from cushing to the gulf coast, as well as the gradual over supply of light crude in the atlantic basin.
the northwest europe benchmark crack spread decreased from 2012 to 2013. in 2014, the crack spread increased in the first three quarters of the year and then declined in the fourth quarter, resulting in an average decrease in 2014 compared to 2013. the decline in benchmark crack spread was due to lower european domestic and export product demand on weak refinery economics while large volumes of imported diesel from the united states, india, asia pacific and russia kept prices under pressure. weak domestic european demand and reduced export markets for gasoline compounded the declining product crack spreads.
results for our m&s segment depend largely on marketing fuel margins, lubricant margins and other specialty product margins. these margins are primarily based on market factors, largely determined by the relationship between demand and supply. marketing fuel margins are primarily determined by the trend of the spot prices for refined products. generally, a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins, while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins. crude oil prices declined significantly during 2014, which resulted in the expected benefit to marketing margins.

index to financial statements results of operations basis of presentation see note 1-separation and basis of presentation, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for information on the basis of presentation of our financial information that affects the comparability of financial information for periods before and after the separation.
effective january 1, 2014, we changed the organizational structure of the internal financial information reviewed by our chief executive officer, and determined this resulted in a change in the composition of our operating segments. the primary effects of this reporting reorganization were:
•   we moved two of our equity investments, excel paralubes and jupiter sulphur, llc, as well as the commission revenues related to needle and anode coke, polypropylene and solvents, from the refining segment to the m&amp;s segment.
•   we moved several refining logistics projects from the refining segment to the midstream segment.
the new segment alignment is presented for the periods ending december 31, 2014, with prior periods recast for comparability.

2014 vs. 2013
our earnings increased $1,036 million, or 28 percent, in 2014, primarily resulting from:
•   recognition of a noncash $696 million after-tax gain related to the pspi share exchange.
•   a gain on disposition and related deferred tax adjustment associated with the sale of mrc, together totaling $369 million after-tax.
•   improved ethylene and polyethylene margins in our chemicals segment.
•   improved worldwide marketing margins.
•   recognition in 2014 of $126 million, after-tax, of the previously deferred gain related to the sale in 2013 of the immingham combined heat and power plant (ichp).
•   improved secondary products margins in our refining segment.
35
index to financial statements these increases were partially offset by:
•   a $131 million after-tax impairment related to the whitegate refinery in cork, ireland.
•   lower realized gasoline and distillate margins as a result of decreased market crack spreads and lower feedstock advantage.
•   lower equity earnings from dcp midstream, reflecting the sharp drop in ngl and crude oil prices in the second half of 2014.
2013 vs. 2012
our earnings decreased $398 million, or 10 percent, in 2013, primarily resulting from a 26 percent decrease in realized refining margins as a result of decreased market crack spreads and impacts related to lower feedstock advantage.
this decrease was partially offset by:
•   lower impairment expense in 2013. we recorded impairments related to our equity investments in mrc, a refining company in melaka, malaysia, and rockies express pipeline llc (rex), a natural gas transmission system, in 2012.
•   improved worldwide marketing margins.
•   lower cpchem interest expense and costs resulting from its early debt retirements in 2012.
see the "segment results" section for additional information on our segment results.
income statement analysis
2014 vs. 2013
sales and other operating revenues decreased 6 percent in 2014, while purchased crude oil and products decreased 8 percent. the decreases were primarily due to lower average prices for crude oil and petroleum products.
equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 20 percent in 2014, primarily resulting from decreased earnings from wrb and dcp midstream, partially offset by increased equity earnings from cpchem.
•   equity in earnings of wrb decreased 69 percent, mainly due to lower refining margins in the central corridor as a result of lower market crack spreads and a lower feedstock advantage, as well as lower interest income received from equity affiliates.
•   equity in earnings of dcp midstream decreased 36 percent, primarily due to a decrease in most commodity prices, as well as increased costs associated with planned asset growth.
•   equity in earnings of cpchem increased 20 percent, primarily driven by improved ethylene and polyethylene realized margins related to increased sales prices.
net gain on dispositions in 2014 were $295 million, compared with $55 million in 2013, primarily resulting from net gains associated with the sale of our interest in mrc in the amount of $145 million, as well as the partial recognition of the previously deferred gain related to the sale of ichp in the amount of $126 million. in 2013, net gain on dispositions primarily resulted from a $48 million gain on the sale of our e-gastm technology business. for additional information, see note 7-assets held for sale or sold, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13 percent in 2014, primarily due to additional fees under marketing consignment fuels agreements, as well as costs associated with acquisitions.
36
index to financial statements impairments in 2014 were $150 million, compared with $29 million in 2013. in 2014, we recorded a $131 million impairment of the whitegate refinery. for additional information, see note 11-impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
see note 22-income taxes, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates.
income from discontinued operations increased $645 million in 2014, compared to 2013, due to the completion of the pspi share exchange in 2014. see note 7-assets held for sale or sold, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on this transaction.
2013 vs. 2012
sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products both decreased 4 percent in 2013. the decreases were primarily due to lower average prices for crude oil and petroleum products.
equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 2 percent in 2013, primarily resulting from decreased earnings from wrb, partially offset by increased equity earnings from cpchem.
•   equity in earnings of wrb decreased 21 percent, mainly due to lower refining margins in the central corridor as a result of lower market crack spreads.
•   equity in earnings of cpchem increased 14 percent, primarily driven by the absence of costs and interest associated with cpchem's early retirement of debt in 2012, improved realized margins, higher equity earnings from cpchem's equity affiliates and the absence of 2012 fixed asset impairments. these increases were partially offset by lower olefins and polyolefins sales volumes related to ethylene outages. in addition, increased turnaround and maintenance activity resulted in lower volumes and higher costs.
net gain on dispositions decreased 72 percent in 2013, primarily resulting from a net gain associated with the sale of the trainer refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets in 2012, compared with a gain resulting from the sale of our e-gastm technology business in 2013. for additional information, see note 7-assets held for sale or sold, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 13 percent in 2013, primarily due to costs associated with the separation and costs relating to a prior retail disposition program in 2012.
impairments in 2013 were $29 million, compared with $1,158 million in 2012. impairments in 2012 included our investments in mrc and rex; a marine terminal and associated assets; and equipment formerly associated with the canceled wilhelmshaven refinery (wrg) upgrade project. for additional information, see note 11-impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

the midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. the natural gas is then processed to extract ngl from the raw gas stream. the remaining "residue" gas is marketed to electric utilities, industrial users and gas marketing companies. most of the ngls are fractionated-separated into individual components such as ethane, propane and butane-and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or blendstock. in addition, the midstream segment includes u.s. transportation, pipeline, terminaling, and refining logistics services associated with the movement of crude oil, refined and specialty products, natural gas and ngl, as well as ngl fractionation, trading, and marketing businesses in the united states. the midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in dcp midstream and the consolidated results of phillips 66 partners lp.
2014 vs. 2013
earnings from the midstream segment increased $38 million in 2014, compared with 2013. the improvement was primarily driven by higher earnings from our transportation and ngl businesses, partially offset by lower earnings from dcp midstream.
transportation earnings increased $34 million in 2014, compared with 2013. this increase primarily resulted from increased throughput fees, as well as higher earnings associated with railcar activity in 2014. these increases were partially offset by higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, reflecting the contribution of previously wholly owned assets to phillips 66 partners.
38
index to financial statements the $75 million decrease in earnings of dcp midstream in 2014 primarily resulted from a decrease in ngl and crude prices in the latter part of 2014. ngl and crude prices have continued to decline in the early part of 2015. in addition, earnings decreased as costs associated with asset growth and maintenance increased in 2014, compared with 2013. earnings further declined due to dcp midstream's contribution of assets to its publicly traded master limited partnership, dcp partners. following the contribution, a percentage of the earnings from these assets are attributable to public unitholders, thus decreasing income attributable to dcp midstream and, thereby, phillips 66. see the "business environment and executive overview" section for additional information on market factors impacting dcp midstream's results.
dcp partners issues, from time to time, limited partner units to the public. these issuances benefited our equity in earnings from dcp midstream, on an after-tax basis, by approximately $45 million in 2014, compared with approximately $62 million in 2013.
the ngl business had an increase in earnings of $79 million, compared with 2013. the increase was primarily due to improved margins driven by strong propane prices in early 2014. additionally, 2014 earnings benefited from gains related to seasonal propane and butane storage activity. also, earnings improved due to higher equity earnings from the dcp sand hills and dcp southern hills pipeline entities. these increases were partially offset by an increase in costs associated with growth projects.
2013 vs. 2012
earnings from the midstream segment increased $417 million in 2013, compared with 2012. the improvement was primarily driven by higher earnings from our transportation business and dcp midstream, partially offset by lower earnings from ngl.
transportation earnings increased $409 million in 2013, compared with 2012. these increases primarily resulted from lower impairments in 2013, as well as increased throughput fees. in 2012, we recorded impairments totaling $303 million after-tax on our equity investment in rex, primarily reflecting a diminished view of fair value of west-to-east natural gas transmission, due to the impact of shale gas production in the northeast. for additional information on the rex impairment, see note 11-impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements. throughput fees were higher in 2013, primarily due to the implementation of market-based intersegment transfer prices for transportation and terminaling services during 2013.
the $31 million increase in earnings of dcp midstream in 2013 primarily resulted from an increase in gains associated with unit issuances by dcp partners, as described below. in addition, higher natural gas and crude oil prices benefitted earnings. these increases were partially offset by lower ngl prices and higher interest expense.
dcp partners unit issuances benefited our equity in earnings from dcp midstream, on an after-tax basis, by approximately $62 million in 2013, compared with approximately $24 million in 2012.
ngl decreased $23 million in 2013, compared with 2012. the decrease was primarily due to inventory impacts, reflecting inventory reductions in 2012 in anticipation of the separation, which caused liquidations of lifo inventory values.

the chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in cpchem, which we account for under the equity method. cpchem uses ngl and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. these products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals. cpchem's business is structured around two primary operating segments: olefins and polyolefins (o&p) and specialties, aromatics and styrenics (sa&s). the o&p segment produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products; ethylene produced is primarily consumed within cpchem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe. the sa&s segment manufactures and markets aromatics products, such as benzene, styrene, paraxylene and cyclohexane, as well as polystyrene and styrene-butadiene copolymers. sa&s also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products. unless otherwise noted, amounts referenced below reflect our net 50 percent interest in cpchem.
2014 vs. 2013
earnings from the chemicals segment increased $151 million, or 15 percent, in 2014, compared with 2013. the increase in earnings was primarily driven by improved ethylene and polyethylene realized margins due to higher sales prices. additionally, chemicals benefited from higher equity earnings from cpchem's o&p equity affiliates.
these increases were partially offset by lower ethylene and polyethylene sales volumes and increased costs related to the port arthur facility fire. in addition, impairments of $69 million after-tax in 2014 further offset a portion of the increase to earnings. see the "business environment and executive overview" section for information on market factors impacting cpchem's results.
in july 2014, a localized fire occurred in the olefins unit at cpchem's port arthur, texas facility, shutting down ethylene production. the port arthur ethylene unit restarted in november. cpchem incurred, on a 100 percent basis, $85 million of associated repair and rebuild costs. because the port arthur ethylene unit was down due to the fire, cpchem experienced a significant reduction in production and sales in several of its product lines stemming from the lack of the port arthur ethylene supply. cpchem's property damage and business interruption insurance coverage limited the potential extent of the financial impact. in the fourth quarter of 2014, cpchem reached an agreement with insurers and recognized into income $120 million related to advanced payments against its business interruption insurance claim.

2013 vs. 2012
cpchem continued to benefit from price-advantaged ngl feedstocks in 2013 due to the location of its manufacturing facilities in the u.s. gulf coast and middle east. earnings from the chemicals segment increased $163 million, or 20 percent, in 2013, compared with 2012. the increase in earnings was primarily driven by:
•   lower costs and interest associated with cpchem's 2012 early retirement of $1 billion of debt.
•   improved polyethylene realized margins.
•   higher equity earnings from cpchem's equity affiliates, reflecting increased volumes and margins.
•   lower asset impairments.
these increases were partially offset by lower olefins sales volumes related to ethylene outages. in addition, increased turnaround and maintenance activity resulted in lower volumes and higher costs.

index to financial statements the refining segment buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels) at 14 refineries, mainly in the united states and europe.
2014 vs. 2013
earnings for the refining segment were $1,771 million in 2014, an increase of $24 million, or 1 percent, compared with 2013. the slight increase in earnings in 2014 was primarily due to higher realized refining margins related to secondary products, as well as increased volumes. in addition, earnings were impacted by a gain on disposition and a related deferred tax adjustment associated with the sale of mrc, together totaling $369 million after-tax.
these increases were mostly offset by:
•   lower earnings from decreased gasoline and distillate margins.
•   negative impacts due to inventory draws in a declining price environment.
•   impairment of the whitegate refinery of $131 million after-tax.
•   lower interest income received from equity affiliates.
see the "business environment and executive overview" section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year's results.
our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 94 percent in 2014, compared to 93 percent in 2013. the increase reflects lower unplanned downtime related to power outages that were experienced in the gulf coast region in 2013.
2013 vs. 2012
earnings for the refining segment were $1,747 million in 2013, a decrease of $1,344 million, or 43 percent, compared with 2012. the decrease in earnings in 2013 was primarily due to lower realized refining margins as a result of a 16 percent reduction in market cracks and impacts related to lower feedstock advantage. in addition to margins, refining results were also impacted by a $104 million after-tax gain from the sale of the trainer refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets in 2012. these decreases were partially offset by reduced impairments recorded in 2012, primarily related to mrc and wrg.
our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 93 percent in both 2013 and 2012, as the lack of weather disruptions were offset by higher turnaround activities.

the m&s segment purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels), mainly in the united states and europe. in addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products (such as base oils and lubricants), as well as power generation operations.
2014 vs. 2013
earnings from the m&s segment increased $140 million, or 16 percent, in 2014, compared with 2013. see the "business environment and executive overview" section for information on marketing fuel margins and other market factors impacting this year's results.
both u.s. and international marketing margins benefited from the timing effect of falling gasoline prices experienced in the second half of 2014. u.s. marketing also benefited from a full year of consignment agreements entered into in 2013, while international marketing margins also benefited from foreign exchange gains in 2014.
in july 2013, we completed the sale of ichp, and deferred the gain from the sale due to an indemnity provided to the buyer. in 2014, we recognized $126 million after-tax of the previously deferred gain, increasing earnings. these increases were partially offset by the lack of ichp earnings in 2014, compared with earnings of $53 million in 2013.
looking forward, absent claims under the ichp indemnity, we expect the remaining deferred gain at december 31, 2014, of $243 million to be recognized in m&s's earnings in the first and second quarters of 2015. in addition, if the spot prices of gasoline stabilize or begin to increase in 2015, we would expect a reduction in m&s's margins in 2015, relative to 2014.

index to financial statements
2013 vs. 2012
earnings from the m&s segment increased $350 million, or 64 percent, in 2013, compared with 2012.
during 2013, u.s. marketing margins benefited from higher renewable identification numbers (rins) values associated with renewable fuels blending activities, particularly during the first three quarters. rin prices decreased during the fourth quarter, as concerns over their availability eased somewhat based on anticipated actions by the u.s. environmental protection agency. the increased rin prices offset weaker underlying components of our u.s. marketing margins during 2013.
m&s earnings benefited from higher international marketing margins in 2013, as well as an after-tax gain of $23 million from the sale of our e-gastm technology business. earnings in 2012 were lowered by income taxes associated with foreign dividends, and 2012 included a full year of earnings from our u.k. power generation business, which was sold in july 2013.

2014 vs. 2013
net interest expense consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. net interest expense decreased $6 million in 2014, compared with 2013, primarily due to increased capitalized interest. this decrease in expense was partially offset due to an increase in average debt outstanding in 2014, reflecting the issuance of debt in late 2014. for additional information, see note 14-debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
corporate general and administrative expenses increased $11 million in 2014, compared with 2013. the increase was primarily due to increased employee benefit costs and charitable contributions.
the category "other" includes certain income tax expenses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. the decrease in costs was primarily due to increased utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards. in addition, our results in 2013 were negatively impacted by higher environmental costs.

net interest expense increased $18 million in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily due to increased average debt outstanding in 2013, reflecting the issuance of debt in early 2012 in connection with the separation. for additional information, see note 14-debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
corporate general and administrative expenses increased $29 million in 2013, compared with 2012. the increase was primarily due to incremental costs and expenses associated with operating as a stand-alone company. repositioning costs decreased $55 million in 2013, compared with 2012.

*capital includes total debt and total equity.
to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities. during 2014, we generated $3.5 billion in cash from operations and received $1.2 billion from asset dispositions, including return of investments in equity affiliates, and $2.5 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt. available cash was primarily used for capital expenditures and investments ($3.8 billion), repurchases of our common stock ($2.3 billion), the pspi share exchange ($0.5 billion) and dividend payments on our common stock ($1.1 billion). during 2014, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $0.2 billion to $5.2 billion.
in addition to cash flows from operating activities, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs, asset sales and our ability to issue securities using our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. we believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below under "significant sources of capital," will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, debt repayment and share repurchases.
significant sources of capital operating activities although net income was higher in 2014 than in 2013, there were large noncash items benefiting 2014 earnings, including the gain on the pspi exchange, gains from asset dispositions and the deferred tax effects of certain asset dispositions. after consideration of these items, underlying earnings in 2014 were similar to 2013. however, working capital negatively impacted 2014 operating cash flow by $1,020 million, compared with a positive impact of $880 million in 2013. working capital impacts in 2014 reflected the negative impact of lower commodity prices on accounts payable, with a lesser positive impact on accounts receivable as we generally carry higher payables on our balance sheet than receivables. see the following paragraph for a discussion of 2013 working capital effects. benefiting 2014 operating cash flow, compared with 2013, was the receipt of a special distribution from wrb, of which $760 million was considered an operating cash flow, partially offset by lower distributions from cpchem.
during 2013, cash of $6,027 million was provided by operating activities, a 40 percent increase from cash from operations of $4,296 million in 2012. the increase in 2013 primarily reflected positive working capital impacts. accounts payable activity increased cash from operations by $360 million in 2013, reflecting both higher volumes and commodity prices. by comparison, lower commodity prices and volumes reduced accounts payable by $985 million in 2012. our distributions from cpchem increased over $500 million in 2013, compared with 2012, reflecting the completion of cpchem's debt repayments in 2012, which allowed increased dividends to us and our co-venturer. partially offsetting the positive impact of working capital changes in 2013 were lower refining margins during 2013, reflecting less favorable market conditions and tightening crude differentials.
47
index to financial statements our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, ngl prices, and chemicals margins. prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control. absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.
the level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows. the output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions. we actively manage the operations of our refineries and, typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices. our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 94 percent in 2014, compared with 93 percent in 2013. we are forecasting 2015 utilization to remain in the low 90-percent range.
our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates, including dcp midstream, cpchem and wrb. over the three years ended december 31, 2014, we received distributions of $654 million from dcp midstream, $1,948 million from cpchem and $4,220 million from wrb. we cannot control the amount or timing of future distributions from equity affiliates; therefore, future distributions by these and other equity affiliates are not assured. we and our co-venturer in dcp midstream have agreed to forgo distributions from dcp midstream during the current low-commodity-price environment.
wrb wrb is a 50-percent-owned business venture with cenovus energy inc. (cenovus). cenovus was obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to wrb over a 10-year period that began in 2007. in 2014, cenovus prepaid its remaining balance under this obligation. as a result, wrb declared a special dividend, which was distributed to the co-venturers in 2014. of the $1,232 million that we received, $760 million was considered a return on our investment in wrb (an operating cash inflow), and $472 million was considered a return of our investment in wrb (an investing cash inflow). the return-of-investment portion of the dividend was included in the "proceeds from asset dispositions" line in our consolidated statement of cash flows. a further $129 million of distributions from wrb during 2014 was considered a return of investment.
asset sales proceeds from asset sales in 2014 were $1,244 million, compared with $1,214 million in 2013 and $286 million in 2012. the 2014 proceeds included a portion of the wrb special dividend as discussed above, as well as the sale of our interest in mrc. the 2013 proceeds included the sale of a power plant in the united kingdom, as well as our gasification technology. the 2012 proceeds included the sale of a refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets located in trainer, pennsylvania, as well as the sale of our riverhead terminal located in riverhead, new york.
phillips 66 partners lp initial public offering in 2013, we formed phillips 66 partners lp, a master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum product and ngl pipelines and terminals, as well as other transportation and midstream assets. on july 26, 2013, phillips 66 partners completed its initial public offering (ipo) of 18,888,750 common units at a price of $23.00 per unit, which included a 2,463,750 common unit over-allotment option that was fully exercised by the underwriters. phillips 66 partners received $404 million in net proceeds from the sale of the units, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, structuring fees and offering expenses. headquartered in houston, texas, phillips 66 partners' assets currently consist of crude oil and refined petroleum product pipeline, terminal, and storage systems in the central and gulf coast regions of the united states, as well as two crude oil rail-unloading facilities, all of which are integral to a connected phillips 66-operated refinery.
contributions to phillips 66 partners lp effective march 1, 2014, we contributed to phillips 66 partners certain transportation, terminaling and storage assets for total consideration of $700 million. these assets consisted of the gold line products system and the medford spheres, two recently constructed refinery-grade propylene storage spheres. phillips 66 partners financed the acquisition with cash on hand of $400 million (primarily reflecting its ipo proceeds), the issuance to us of 3,530,595 and 72,053 additional common and general partner units, respectively, valued at $140 million, and a five-year, $160 million note payable to a subsidiary of phillips 66.
48
index to financial statements effective december 1, 2014, we contributed to phillips 66 partners certain logistics assets for total consideration of $340 million. these assets consisted of two recently constructed crude oil rail-unloading facilities located at or adjacent to our bayway and ferndale refineries, and the cross channel connector pipeline assets located near the partnership's pasadena terminal. phillips 66 partners financed the acquisition with the borrowing of $28 million under its revolving credit facility, the assumption of a five-year, $244 million note payable to a subsidiary of phillips 66, and the issuance to phillips 66 of 1,066,412 common and 21,764 general partner units valued at $68 million.
in addition to these two transactions, we made smaller contributions to phillips 66 partners of projects under development in the fourth quarter, for consideration in the aggregate of approximately $55 million.
ownership at december 31, 2014, we owned a 73 percent limited partner interest and a 2 percent general partner interest in phillips 66 partners, while its public unitholders owned a 25 percent limited partner interest. we consolidate phillips 66 partners as a variable interest entity for financial reporting purposes. see note 4-variable interest entities (vies), in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on why we consolidate the partnership. as a result of this consolidation, the public unitholders' ownership interest in phillips 66 partners is reflected as a noncontrolling interest in our financial statements, including $415 million in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2014. generally, contributions of assets by us to phillips 66 partners will eliminate in consolidation, other than third-party debt or equity offerings made by phillips 66 partners to finance such transactions. for the 2014 contributions discussed above, the first did not impact our consolidated financial statements, while the second increased consolidated cash and debt by $28 million at the time of the transaction.
recent transactions on february 13, 2015, we entered into a contribution agreement with phillips 66 partners under which phillips 66 partners will acquire our equity interest in explorer pipeline company (19.46 percent), dcp sand hills pipeline, llc (33.33 percent), and dcp southern hills pipeline, llc (33.33 percent). we account for each of these investments under the equity method of accounting. the total consideration for the transaction is expected to be $1,010 million, which will consist of approximately $880 million in cash and the issuance of common units and general partner units to us with an aggregate fair value of $130 million. the transaction is expected to close in early march 2015, subject to standard closing conditions.
during february 2015, phillips 66 partners initiated two registered public offerings of securities:
•   5,250,000 common units representing limited partner interests, at a public offering price of $75.50 per unit. the net proceeds at closing are expected to be $384 million, not including an over-allotment option exercisable by the underwriters to purchase up to an additional 787,500 common units.
•   $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which include $300 million of 2.646% senior notes due 2020, $500 million of 3.605% senior notes due 2025, and $300 million of 4.680% senior notes due 2045.
closings of both public offerings are expected to occur in late february 2015. phillips 66 partners expects to use the net proceeds of both offerings to fund the acquisition transaction discussed above, repay existing borrowings from a subsidiary of phillips 66, fund capital expenditures and for general partnership purposes.
credit facilities and commercial paper during the fourth quarter of 2014, we amended our phillips 66 revolving credit facility, primarily to increase its borrowing capacity from $4.5 billion to $5 billion and to extend the term from june 2018 to december 2019. the phillips 66 facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit, or as support for our commercial paper program. the facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions and contains covenants that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type for comparable commercial borrowers, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 60 percent. the agreement has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts; violation of covenants; cross-payment default and cross-acceleration (in each case, to indebtedness in excess of a threshold amount); and a change of control. borrowings under the facility will incur interest at the london interbank offered rate (libor) plus a margin based on the credit rating of our senior unsecured long-term debt as determined from time to time by standard & poor's
49
index to financial statements ratings services (s&p) and moody's investors service (moody's). the facility also provides for customary fees, including administrative agent fees and commitment fees. as of december 31, 2014, no amount had been directly drawn under this facility and $51 million in letters of credit had been issued that were supported by the facility. as a result, we ended 2014 with $4.9 billion of capacity under this facility.
we have a $5 billion commercial paper program for short-term working capital needs. commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. as of december 31, 2014, we had no borrowings under our commercial paper program.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, phillips 66 partners also amended its revolving credit facility, primarily to increase its borrowing capacity from $250 million to $500 million and to extend the term from june 2018 to november 2019. the phillips 66 partners facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions. as of december 31, 2014, $18 million had been drawn under the facility, leaving $482 million of available capacity.
trade receivables securitization facility in 2014, we terminated our $696 million trade receivables securitization facility. no amounts were drawn on this facility throughout its duration, and at the time of termination no letters of credit were outstanding thereunder.
debt financing in november 2014, we issued $2.5 billion of debt consisting of:
•   $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.650% senior notes due 2034.
•   $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2044.
the notes are guaranteed by phillips 66 company, a 100-percent-owned subsidiary. net proceeds received from these offerings will be used to repay $800 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 1.950% senior notes due 2015, for capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes.
our $8.3 billion of outstanding senior notes were issued by phillips 66 and are guaranteed by phillips 66 company. our senior unsecured long-term debt has been rated investment grade by s&p (bbb+) and moody's (a3). we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. if our credit rating deteriorated to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above.
shelf registration we have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.
other financing during 2014, we recorded capital lease obligations related to equipment and transportation assets. these leases mature within the next fifteen years. during 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation for use of an oil terminal in the united kingdom which matures in 2033. the present value of our minimum capital lease payments for these obligations as of december 31, 2014, was $205 million.
off-balance sheet arrangements as part of our normal ongoing business operations, we enter into agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, with costs and risks apportioned among the parties as provided by the agreements. in april 2012, in connection with the separation, we entered into an agreement to guarantee 100 percent of certain outstanding debt obligations of merey sweeny, l.p. (mslp). at december 31, 2014, the aggregate principal amount of mslp debt guaranteed by us was $189 million.
for additional information about guarantees, see note 15-guarantees, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

index to financial statements capital requirements for information about our capital expenditures and investments, see "capital spending" below.
our debt balance at december 31, 2014, was $8.7 billion and our debt-to-capital ratio was 28 percent, within our target range of 20-to-30 percent.
on february 4, 2015, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per common share, payable march 2, 2015, to holders of record at the close of business on february 17, 2015. we are forecasting annual double-digit percentage increases in our dividend rate in 2015 and 2016.
during the second half of 2013, we entered into a construction agency agreement and an operating lease agreement with a financial institution for the construction of our new headquarters facility to be located in houston, texas. under the construction agency agreement, we act as construction agent for the financial institution over a construction period of up to three years and eight months, during which time we request cash draws from the financial institution to fund construction costs. through december 31, 2014, approximately $225 million had been drawn, of which approximately $205 million is recourse to us should certain events of default occur. the operating lease becomes effective after construction is substantially complete and we are able to occupy the facility. the operating lease has a term of five years and provides us the option, at the end of the lease term, to request to renew the lease, purchase the facility, or assist the financial institution in marketing it for resale.
during 2012 and 2013, our board of directors authorized repurchases totaling up to $5 billion of our outstanding common stock. in july 2014, our board of directors authorized additional share repurchases totaling up to $2 billion. the share repurchases are expected to be funded primarily through available cash. the shares will be repurchased from time to time in the open market at the company's discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and the tax sharing agreement entered into in connection with the separation. we are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may commence, suspend or discontinue purchases at any time or from time to time without prior notice. since the inception of our share repurchases in 2012, we have repurchased a total of 73,227,369 shares at a cost of $4.9 billion through december 31, 2014. shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares.
on october 15, 2014, we signed agreements to form two joint ventures to develop the dakota access pipeline (dapl) and energy transfer crude oil pipeline (etcop) projects. we own a 25 percent interest in each joint venture, with our co-venturer holding the remaining 75 percent interest and acting as operator of both the dapl and etcop systems. our share of construction cost is estimated to be approximately $1.2 billion, which will be reflected as investments in equity-method affiliates. we expect the majority of this capital spending commitment to be incurred in 2015 and 2016, and anticipate it to be funded as part of our overall capital program.

(b)   represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. we expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled by operating cash flows in the applicable maturity period. the majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil and unfractionated ngl. the products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $39,822 million. in addition, $22,117 million are product purchases from cpchem, mostly for natural gas and ngl over the remaining contractual term of 85 years, and $8,575 million from excel paralubes, for base oil over the remaining contractual term of 10 years.
purchase obligations of $6,385 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. the remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator.
(c)   excludes pensions. for the 2015 through 2019 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $138 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states and an average of $56 million per year to our non-u.s. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. the u.s. five-year average consists of $30 million for 2015 and then approximately $165 million per year for the remaining four years. our minimum funding in 2015 is expected to be $30 million in the united states and $70 million outside the united states.
(d)   excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $134 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable or the amounts relate to potential refunds. also excludes interest and penalties of $16 million. although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

**2015 budget includes non-cash capitalized leases of $11 million in refining and $21 million in corporate and other.
***our share of capital spending, which has been self-funded by the equity affiliate and is expected to be in 2015.
midstream during the three-year period ended december 31, 2014, dcp midstream had a self-funded capital program, and thus required no new capital infusions from us or our co-venturer, spectra energy corp. during this three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, dcp midstream's capital expenditures and investments were $6.1 billion. in 2012, we invested approximately $0.5 billion in total to acquire a one-third direct interest in dcp sand hills pipeline, llc (dcp sand hills) and dcp southern hills pipeline, llc (dcp southern hills). phillips 66, spectra energy partners and dcp midstream partners each own a one-third interest in each of the two pipeline entities, and both pipelines are operated by dcp midstream. in 2013 and 2014, we made additional investments in both dcp sand hills and dcp southern hills, increasing our total direct investment to $0.8 billion.
other capital spending in our midstream segment not related to dcp midstream or the sand hills and southern hills pipelines over the three-year period included construction activities in 2014 related to our sweeny fractionator one and freeport lpg export terminal projects, our acquisition in 2014 of a 7.1 million-barrel-storage-capacity crude oil and petroleum products terminal located near beaumont, texas, the purchase in 2014 of an additional 5.7 percent interest in the refined products explorer pipeline, and spending associated with return, reliability and maintenance projects. in addition to our sweeny fractionator one and freeport lpg export terminal projects, our major capital activities in 2013 and 2014 included the construction of rail racks to accept advantaged crude deliveries at our bayway and ferndale refineries.
chemicals during the three-year period ended december 31, 2014, cpchem had a self-funded capital program, and thus required no new capital infusions from us or our co-venturer, chevron u.s.a. inc. (chevron), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of chevron corporation. during the three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, cpchem's capital expenditures and investments were $3.8 billion. in addition, cpchem's advances to equity affiliates, primarily used for project construction and start-up activities, were $0.5 billion and its repayments received from equity affiliates were $0.4 billion.

index to financial statements refining capital spending for the refining segment during the three-year period ended december 31, 2014, was $2.6 billion, primarily for air emission reduction and clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to increase accessibility of advantaged crudes and improve product yields, improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units, and safety-related projects.
key projects completed during the three-year period included:
•   installation of facilities to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from the crude furnace and installation of a new high-efficiency vacuum furnace at bayway refinery.
•   completion of gasoline benzene reduction projects at the alliance, bayway, and ponca city refineries.
•   installation of new coke drums at the billings and ponca city refineries.
•   installation of a new waste heat boiler at the bayway refinery to reduce carbon monoxide emissions while providing steam production.
major construction activities in progress include:
•   installation of facilities to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from the fluid catalytic cracker at the alliance refinery.
•   installation of a tail gas treating unit at the humber refinery to reduce emissions from the sulfur recovery units.
generally, our equity affiliates in the refining segment are intended to have self-funding capital programs. during this three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, wrb's capital expenditures and investments were $0.8 billion. we expect wrb's 2015 capital program to be self-funding.
marketing and specialties capital spending for the m&s segment during the three-year period ended december 31, 2014, was primarily for the acquisition of, and investments in, a limited number of retail sites in the western and midwestern portions of the united states; the acquisition of spectrum corporation, a private label specialty lubricants business headquartered in memphis, tennessee, as well as the remaining interest that we did not already own in an entity that operates a power and steam generation plant; reliability and maintenance projects; and projects targeted at growing our international marketing business.
corporate and other capital spending for corporate and other during the three-year period ended december 31, 2014, was primarily for projects related to information technology and facilities.
2015 budget our 2015 capital budget is $4.6 billion. this excludes our portion of planned capital spending by joint ventures dcp midstream, cpchem and wrb totaling $2.1 billion, all of which are expected to be self-funded. we continually evaluate our capital budget in light of market conditions. as part of our disciplined approach to capital allocation, we retain the flexibility to adjust the capital budget as the year progresses.
in midstream, we plan to invest $3.2 billion in our ngl and transportation business lines. midstream capital includes approximately $0.2 billion expected to be spent by phillips 66 partners to support organic growth projects. in ngl, construction of the 100,000 barrel-per-day sweeny fractionator one and the 4.4 million-barrel-per-month freeport lpg export terminal on the u.s. gulf coast continues. in transportation, we are investing in pipeline and rail infrastructure projects to move crude oil from the bakken/three forks production area of north dakota to market centers throughout the united states. in addition, expansion of the beaumont terminal and related infrastructure opportunities are being pursued.
we plan to spend $1.1 billion of capital in refining, approximately 75 percent of which will be sustaining capital. these investments are related to reliability and maintenance, safety and environmental projects, including compliance with the
54
index to financial statements new epa tier 3 gasoline specifications. discretionary refining capital investments are expected to be directed toward small, high-return, quick pay-out projects, primarily to enhance the use of advantaged crudes and improve product yields.
in marketing and specialties, we plan to invest approximately $0.2 billion for growth and sustaining capital. the growth investment reflects our continued plans to expand and enhance our fuel marketing business.
in corporate and other, we plan to fund approximately $0.2 billion in projects primarily related to information technology and facilities.
contingencies a number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been brought against us in connection with matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. we regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. in the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. we do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. in the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.
based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. as we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties. estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
legal and tax matters our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. this process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. see note 22-income taxes, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.
environmental we are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:
•   u.s. federal clean air act, which governs air emissions.
•   u.s. federal clean water act, which governs discharges to water bodies.
•   european union regulation for registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals (reach), which governs the manufacture, placing on the market or use of chemicals.
•   u.s. federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.
•   u.s. federal resource conservation and recovery act (rcra), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.
55
index to financial statements
•   u.s. federal emergency planning and community right-to-know act (epcra), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments.
•   u.s. federal safe drinking water act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.
•   u.s. federal oil pollution act of 1990 (opa90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the united states.
•   european union trading directive resulting in the european emissions trading scheme, which uses a market-based mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. they also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. in addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency's processing of the application. many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.
many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. while similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.
the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. however, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate. notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the united states.
an example in the fuels area is the energy policy act of 2005, which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. these obligations were changed with the enactment of the energy independence and security act of 2007 (eisa). eisa requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types to be included through 2022. we have met the increasingly stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. it is uncertain how various future requirements contained in eisa, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations. also, we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated. for the 2014 compliance year, the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) proposed to reduce the statutory volumes of advanced and total renewable fuel using authority granted to it under eisa. we do not know whether this reduction will be finalized as proposed or whether the epa will utilize its authority to reduce statutory volumes in future compliance years.
we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents. remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the united states. federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. in addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (mtbe) for both soil and groundwater.
at rcra-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. if conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. in contrast to cercla, which is often referred to as "superfund," the cost of corrective action activities under rcra corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. we anticipate increased expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.
56
index to financial statements we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute. on occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. these requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. as of december 31, 2013, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at 35 sites around the united states. during 2014, there were no new sites for which we received notification of potential liability and one site was deemed resolved and closed, leaving 34 unresolved sites with potential liability at december 31, 2014.
for most superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned. prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. in some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan. there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.
expensed environmental costs were $630 million in 2014 and are expected to be approximately $680 million in each of 2015 and 2016. capitalized environmental costs were $411 million in 2014 and are expected to be approximately $320 million in each of 2015 and 2016. this amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance.
accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis).
many of these liabilities result from cercla, rcra and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. we also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of cercla, rcra or state enforcement activities. if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. in the future, we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra. remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.
at december 31, 2014, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $496 million, compared with $492 million at december 31, 2013, and $530 million at december 31, 2012. we expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.
notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. however, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.
the epa's renewable fuel standard (rfs) program was implemented in accordance with the energy policy act of 2005 and eisa. the rfs program sets annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states. a renewable identification number (rin) represents a serial number assigned to each gallon of biofuel produced or imported into the united states. as a producer of petroleum-based motor fuels, we are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the epa's quota and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program. the market for rins has been the subject of fraudulent activity, and we have identified that we have unknowingly
57
index to financial statements purchased rins in the past that were invalid due to fraudulent activity of third parties. although costs to replace fraudulently marketed rins that have been determined to be invalid have not been material through december 31, 2014, it is reasonably possible that some additional rins that we have previously purchased may also be determined to be invalid. should that occur, we could incur additional replacement charges. although the cost for replacing any additional fraudulently marketed rins is not reasonably estimable at this time, we could have a possible exposure of approximately $150 million before tax. it could take several years for this possible exposure to reach ultimate resolution; therefore, we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of additional fraudulent rins replacement costs in any single interim or annual period.
climate change there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (ghg) reduction. these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:
•   european union emissions trading scheme (eu ets), which is part of the european union's policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions. eu ets impacts factories, power stations and other installations across all eu member states.
•   california's global warming solutions act, which requires the california air resources board to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will target reduction of california's ghg emissions by 25 percent by 2020.
•   the u.s. supreme court decision in massachusetts v. epa, 549 u.s. 497, 127 s. ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the epa has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an "air pollutant" under the federal clean air act.
•   the epa's announcement on march 29, 2010 (published as "interpretation of regulations that determine pollutants covered by clean air act permitting programs," 75 fed. reg. 17004 (april 2, 2010)), and the epa's and u.s. department of transportation's joint promulgation of a final rule on april 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of ghgs under the clean air act. these collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change.
•   carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.
•   ghg emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions.
in the eu, the first phase of the eu ets completed at the end of 2007 and phase ii was undertaken from 2008 through to 2012. the current phase (phase iii) runs from 2013 through to 2020, with the main changes being reduced allocation of free allowances and increased auctioning of new allowances. phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the eu ets, and the company is actively engaged in minimizing any financial impact from the eu ets.
in the united states, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal or state levels with respect to ghg emissions. such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.
compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg emission trading program or ghg reduction requirements could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources. an example of one such program is california's cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the state's global warming solutions act. the program has been limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in california, but beginning in january 2015 expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in california. we expect inclusion of transportation fuels in california's cap and trade program as currently promulgated will increase our cap and trade program compliance costs. the ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:
58
index to financial statements
•   whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.
•   the nature of the legislation or regulation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions).
•   the ghg reductions required.
•   the price and availability of offsets.
•   the amount and allocation of allowances.
•   technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.
•   any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).
•   whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. see note 2-accounting policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. the following discussion of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussion of contingencies in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.
impairments long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group. if, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, including applicable liabilities, the carrying value of the long-lived assets included in the asset group is written down to estimated fair value. individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets (for example, at a refinery complex level). because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods: the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants; a market multiple of earnings for similar assets; or historical market transactions of similar assets, adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary. the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.
investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value. such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment's carrying amount.  when it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated fair value.  when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. when quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and a market analysis of comparable assets, if appropriate. differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.
59
index to financial statements asset retirement obligations under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites. our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries. estimating the timing and amount of payments for future asset removal costs is difficult. most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future, and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.
environmental costs in addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. these projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries, underground storage sites and non-operated sites. future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.
intangible assets and goodwill at december 31, 2014, we had $756 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, and thus they are not amortized. this judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. if, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives, amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis. as long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to annual impairment tests that require management's judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets.
at december 31, 2014, we had $3.3 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations. goodwill is not amortized. instead, goodwill is subject to at least annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level. the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment.
effective january 1, 2014, we reallocated $52 million of goodwill from the refining segment to the m&s segment based upon the realignment of certain assets between the reporting units. goodwill was reassigned to the reporting units using a relative fair value approach. goodwill impairment testing was completed and no impairment recognition was required. see note 27-segment disclosures and related information, for additional information on this segment realignment. sales or dispositions of significant assets within a reporting unit are allocated a portion of that reporting unit's goodwill, based on relative fair values, which adjusts the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition.
because quoted market prices for our reporting units were not available, management applied judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test. management used all available information to make this fair value determination, including observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization and the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets.
we completed our annual impairment test, as of october 1, 2014, and concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their recorded net book values (including goodwill). our refining reporting unit had a percentage excess of fair value over recorded net book value of approximately 60 percent. our transportation and m&s reporting unit's fair values exceeded their recorded net book values by over 100 percent. however, a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment. for example, a prolonged or significant decline in our stock price or a significant decline in actual or forecasted earnings could provide evidence of a significant decline in fair value and a need to record a material impairment of goodwill for one or more of our reporting units.
60
index to financial statements tax assets and liabilities our operations are subject to various taxes, including federal, state and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, property and payroll taxes. we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. the recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates. we recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. a contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due.
in determining our income tax provision, we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets. based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income. if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised.
new tax laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations, are continuously being proposed or promulgated. the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time.
projected benefit obligations determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. a 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $80 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $30 million. in determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans.
in 2014 and 2013, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7 percent for the u.s. pension plan assets, which account for 75 percent of the company's pension plan assets. the actual asset returns for 2014 and 2013 were 9 percent and 16 percent, respectively. for the eight years prior to the separation, actual asset returns averaged 7 percent for the u.s. pension plan assets. the 2013 asset returns of 16 percent were associated with a broad recovery in the financial markets during the year.
new accounting standards in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update (asu) no. 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)." the new standard converged guidance on recognizing revenues in contracts with customers under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and international financial reporting standards. this asu is intended to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. asu 2014-09 is effective for annual and quarterly reporting periods of public entities beginning after december 15, 2016. early application for public entities is not permitted. we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu 2014-09 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on our financial position and results of operations.

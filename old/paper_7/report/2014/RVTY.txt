overview of fiscal year 2014
during fiscal year 2014, we continued to see good performance from acquisitions, investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives. our overall revenue in fiscal year 2014 increased $79.6 million, or 4%, as compared to fiscal year 2013, reflecting an increase of $42.3 million, or 4%, in our human health segment revenue and an increase of $37.3 million, or 4%, in our environmental health segment revenue. the increase in our human health segment revenue during fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to growth in our diagnostics market from our newborn and prenatal screening and infectious disease testing solutions as well as from our medical imaging business' new wireless cassette detector. the increase in our environmental health segment revenue during fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to an increase in our services revenue, which included our onesource multivendor service offerings within our laboratory service market.
in our human health segment during fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013, we experienced growth in our diagnostics business as birth rates increased and from continued expansion of our prenatal, newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in emerging markets such as china and brazil, as well as from increased demand for our medical imaging business' new wireless cassette detector used in diagnostic imaging and veterinary applications. in the research market we experienced growth related to our informatics, radiometric detection, and high-content screening offerings, as well as our microfluidics technology licensing program. this growth in the research market was partially offset by declines in some products in our research market due to weakness in the global academic end market, specifically in europe, as well as the expiration of certain patents in our licensing portfolio. as the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers, we anticipate that the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease, which can result in savings of long-term health care costs as well as create better outcomes for patients, are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets.
in our environmental health segment, our laboratory services business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time, while reducing maintenance costs, all of which continue to be critical for our customers. during fiscal year 2014, we continued to experience growth in our laboratory services business, which included the addition of new customers to our onesource multivendor service offering. these increases were partially offset by decreased demand across some of our products in the environmental and industrial markets, primarily in the asian industrial end markets. we anticipate that the continued development of contaminant regulations and corresponding testing protocols will result in increased demand for efficient, analytically sensitive and information rich testing solutions.
our consolidated gross margins decreased 34 basis points in fiscal year 2014, as compared to fiscal year 2013, due to unfavorable changes in product mix, with an increase in sales of lower gross margin product offerings, pricing pressure, a higher mark-to-market loss for our postretirement benefit plans in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013, and negative impacts from foreign currency exchange rates. these items were partially offset by increased sales volume and cost containment and productivity initiatives. our consolidated operating margin decreased 114 basis points in fiscal year 2014, as compared to fiscal year 2013, primarily due to a pre-tax loss of $75.9 million in fiscal year 2014 as compared to pre-tax income of $17.6 million in fiscal year 2013 for the mark-to-market adjustments for our postretirement plans and lower gross margins. these items were partially offset by increased sales volume, cost containment and productivity initiatives and lower restructuring charges.

we believe we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of the spending trends in our end markets and to promote our efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services. overall, we believe that our strategic focus on human health and environmental health coupled with our breadth of end markets, deep portfolio of technologies and applications, leading market positions, global scale and financial strength will provide us with a foundation for growth.
consolidated results of continuing operations revenue
2014 compared to 2013. revenue for fiscal year 2014 was $2,237.2 million, as compared to $2,157.6 million for fiscal year 2013, an increase of $79.6 million, or 4%, which includes an approximate 1% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and an approximate 1% decrease in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. the total increase in revenue reflects a $42.3 million, or 4%, increase in our human health segment revenue, due to an increase in diagnostics market revenue of $39.8 million and an increase in research market revenue of $2.5 million. our environmental health segment revenue increased $37.3 million, or 4%, due to an increase in laboratory services market revenue of $33.8 million and an increase in environmental and industrial markets revenue of $3.5 million. as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $2.9 million of revenue primarily related to our informatics business in our human health segment for fiscal year 2014 and $7.3 million for fiscal year 2013 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.
2013 compared to 2012. revenue for fiscal year 2013 was $2,157.6 million, as compared to $2,105.2 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $52.4 million, or 2%, which includes an approximate 1% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and an approximate 0.4% decrease in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. the total increase in revenue reflects a $36.5 million, or 3%, increase in our human health segment revenue, due to an increase in diagnostics market revenue of $22.8 million and an increase in research market revenue of $13.7 million. our environmental health segment revenue for fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 increased $15.9 million, or 2%, due to an increase in laboratory services market revenue of $23.2 million, partially offset by decreases in environmental and industrial markets revenue of $7.3 million. as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $7.3 million of revenue primarily related to our informatics business in our human health segment for fiscal year 2013 and $26.2 million for fiscal year 2012 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.

research and development expenses
2014 compared to 2013. research and development expenses for fiscal year 2014 were $121.1 million, as compared to $132.4 million for fiscal year 2013, a decrease of $11.3 million, or 8.5%. as a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses decreased to 5.4% in fiscal year 2014, as compared to 6.1% in fiscal year 2013. amortization of intangible assets increased and was $0.6 million for fiscal year 2014, as compared to $0.3 million for fiscal year 2013. the mark-to-market adjustment for postretirement benefit plans was a loss of $0.4 million for fiscal year 2014, as compared to income of $0.3 million for fiscal year 2013. stock-based compensation expense decreased and was $0.5 million for fiscal year 2014, as compared to $0.9 million for fiscal year 2013. acquisition related costs added an incremental expense of $0.2 million for fiscal year 2013. we have a broad product base, and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs. in addition to the above items, the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily the result of the consolidation of research and development activities into our newly opened center for innovation. we directed research and development efforts similarly during fiscal years 2014 and 2013, primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment, and the environmental, industrial and laboratory services markets within our environmental health segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives.
2013 compared to 2012. research and development expenses for fiscal year 2013 were $132.4 million, as compared to $131.8 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $0.6 million, or 0.4%. as a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses decreased to 6.1% in fiscal year 2013, as compared to 6.3% in fiscal year 2012. amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $0.3 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to $0.5 million for fiscal year 2012. the mark-to-market adjustment for postretirement benefit plans was income of $0.3 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to a loss of $0.2 million for fiscal year 2012. stock-based compensation expense increased and was $0.9 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to $0.7 million for fiscal year 2012. acquisition related costs added an incremental expense of $0.2 million for fiscal year 2013. we directed research and development efforts similarly during fiscal years 2013 and 2012, primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment, and the environmental, industrial and laboratory services markets within our environmental health segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives.

restructuring and contract termination charges, net we have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the alignment of our operations with our growth strategy, the integration of our business units and productivity initiatives. restructuring and contract termination charges for fiscal year 2014 were $13.4 million, as compared to $33.9 million for fiscal year 2013 and $25.1 million for fiscal year 2012.
we implemented a restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives (the "q3 2014 plan"). we implemented restructuring plans in the second and first quarters of fiscal year 2014, the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to focus resources on higher growth end markets (the "q2 2014 plan", "q1 2014 plan", "q1 2013 plan" and "q4 2012 plan", respectively). we implemented restructuring plans in the fourth and third quarters of fiscal year 2013 consisting of workforce reductions and the closure of excess facility space principally intended to shift certain of our research and development resources into a newly opened center for innovation (the "q4 2013 plan" and "q3 2013 plan", respectively). we implemented restructuring plans in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013, and the third, second and first quarters of fiscal year 2012 consisting of workforce reductions and the closure of excess facility space principally intended to shift certain of our operations into a newly established shared service center, as well as realign operations, research and development resources, and production resources as a result of previous acquisitions (the "q2 2013 plan", "q3 2012 plan", "q2 2012 plan" and "q1 2012 plan", respectively). all other previous restructuring plans were workforce reductions or the closure of excess facility space principally intended to integrate our businesses in order to realign operations, reduce costs, achieve operational efficiencies and shift resources into geographic regions and end markets that are more consistent with our growth strategy (the "previous plans"). we also have terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and have recorded charges, to the extent applicable, for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us. we expect no significant impact on future operating results or cash flows from the restructuring activities executed in fiscal year 2014. we expect the impact of future cost savings on operating results and cash flows from the restructuring activities executed in fiscal year 2013 to exceed $9.0 million annually beginning in fiscal year 2015, primarily resulting in a decrease in research and development expenses.

____________________________
(1)   during fiscal year 2014, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $0.1 million in our environmental health segment related to lower than expected costs associated with the remaining severance payments for the q4 2013 plan and recorded an additional pre-tax restructuring charge of $1.1 million in our human health segment related to higher than expected costs associated with the closure of the excess facility for the q4 2013 plan.
(2)   during fiscal year 2014, we recorded pre-tax restructuring reversals of $0.3 million in our human health segment and $0.5 million in our environmental health segment related to lower than expected costs associated with the remaining severance payments for the q2 2013 plan. in addition during fiscal year 2014, we incurred an additional pre-tax restructuring charge of $0.1 million in each of our human health and environmental health segments related to higher than expected costs associated with the closure of the excess facility space for the q2 2013 plan.

impairment of assets
2014 compared to 2013. impairment of assets was zero in fiscal year 2014, as compared to $0.2 million in fiscal year 2013. the fiscal year 2013 pre-tax impairment charge was $0.2 million for the impairment of certain long-lived assets within our human health segment as the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets were not recoverable and exceeded their fair value. additional information regarding impairment of assets is discussed in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
2013 compared to 2012. impairment of assets was $0.2 million in fiscal year 2013, as compared to $74.2 million in fiscal year 2012. as part of integrating our recent acquisitions, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we decided that prospectively we would primarily focus on the perkinelmer trade name. accordingly, we undertook a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy, which resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of $73.4 million in our human health segment and $0.7 million in our environmental health segment during fiscal year 2012.
interest and other expense, net interest and other expense, net, consisted of the following:

2014 compared to 2013. interest and other expense, net, for fiscal year 2014 was an expense of $41.1 million, as compared to an expense of $64.1 million for fiscal year 2013, a decrease of $23.0 million. the decrease in interest and other expense, net, in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense and other expense. interest expense decreased by $13.7 million in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013, primarily due to the redemption of our fixed rate 2015 notes in fiscal year 2013, resulting in lower debt outstanding and an increased mix of variable rate debt with lower interest rates during fiscal year 2014. in addition, during fiscal year 2013, we wrote-off $2.8 million for the remaining unamortized derivative losses for previously settled cash flow hedges and wrote-off $0.2 million for the remaining deferred debt issuance costs related to the prepayment of our 2015 notes. other expenses for fiscal year 2014 decreased by $9.3 million as compared to fiscal year 2013, primarily due to a prepayment premium of $11.1 million for the redemption of our 2015 notes in fiscal year 2013, which was partially offset by expenses related to foreign currency transactions and translation of non-functional currency assets and liabilities. a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading "liquidity and capital resources."
2013 compared to 2012. interest and other expense, net, for fiscal year 2013 was an expense of $64.1 million, as compared to an expense of $48.0 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $16.2 million. the increase in interest and other expense, net, in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to an increase in other expense, net, resulting from a prepayment premium of $11.1 million for the redemption of our 2015 notes. interest expense increased by $4.1 million in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012, primarily due to the write-off of $2.8 million for the remaining unamortized derivative losses for previously settled cash flow hedges and the write-off of $0.2 million for the remaining deferred debt issuance costs related to the prepayment of our 2015 notes. interest income decreased by $0.1 million in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012, primarily due to lower cash balances throughout fiscal year 2013. other expenses for fiscal year 2013 increased by $11.9 million as compared to fiscal year 2012, and consisted primarily of the prepayment premium of $11.1 million for the redemption of our 2015 notes, expenses related to foreign currency transactions and translation of non-functional currency assets and liabilities.
provision for (benefit from) income taxes
2014 compared to 2013. the fiscal year 2014 provision for income taxes on continuing operations was $8.4 million, as compared to a benefit of $10.6 million for fiscal year 2013. the effective tax rate on continuing operations was a provision of 5.0% for fiscal year 2014 as compared to a benefit of 6.5% for fiscal year 2013. the provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to income in lower tax rate jurisdictions, partially offset by losses in higher rate jurisdictions and a tax benefit of $7.0 million related to discrete items. the benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2013 was primarily due a tax benefit of $24.0 million related to discrete items and losses in higher tax rate jurisdictions, partially offset by a provision from income taxes related to profits in lower tax rate jurisdictions. the $24.0 million of discrete items includes $9.4 million for
35
lapses in statutes of limitations during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 and $9.2 million primarily for lapses in statutes of limitations and audit settlements in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013.
2013 compared to 2012. the fiscal year 2013 benefit from income taxes on continuing operations was $10.6 million, as compared to a benefit of $16.1 million for fiscal year 2012. the effective tax rate on continuing operations was a benefit of 6.5% for fiscal year 2013 as compared to a benefit of 29.2% for fiscal year 2012. the benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to a tax benefit of $24.0 million related to discrete items and losses in higher tax rate jurisdictions, partially offset by a provision from income taxes related to profits in lower tax rate jurisdictions. the $24.0 million of discrete items includes $9.4 million for lapses in statutes of limitations during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 and $9.2 million primarily for lapses in statutes of limitations and audit settlements in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. the benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to a tax benefit of $7.0 million related to discrete items and losses in higher tax rate jurisdictions, which included the pre-tax impairment charges of $74.2 million, partially offset by a provision from income taxes related to profits in lower tax rate jurisdictions.
discontinued operations as part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, we have discontinued certain businesses. we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and, accordingly, have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented. any remaining assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately, and are reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 28, 2014 and december 29, 2013.
we recorded the following pre-tax gains and losses, which have been reported as a net gain or loss on disposition of discontinued operations during the three fiscal years ended:

in may 2014, our management approved the shutdown of our microarray-based diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states, which had been reported within our human health segment. we determined that, with the lack of adequate reimbursement from health care payers, the microarray-based diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states would need significant investment in its operations to reduce costs in order to effectively compete in the market. the shutdown of the microarray-based diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states resulted in a $0.1 million net pre-tax loss primarily related to the disposal of fixed assets, which was partially offset by the sale of a building in fiscal year 2014.
in june 2010, we sold our photoflash business, which was included in our environmental health segment. we recognized a pre-tax loss of $0.01 million in fiscal year 2014, a pre-tax gain of $0.5 million in fiscal year 2013 and a pre-tax gain of $2.5 million in fiscal year 2012 for contingent consideration related to this sale. these gains and losses were recognized as a (loss) gain on disposition of discontinued operations.
in august 1999, we sold the assets of our technical service business. during fiscal years 2014 and 2013, we recorded pre-tax losses of $0.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively, for a contingency related to this business. these losses were recognized as a (loss) gain on disposition of discontinued operations.
during fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, we settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other discontinued operations. we recognized net pre-tax losses during fiscal years 2013 and 2012. these losses were recognized as a (loss) gain on disposition of discontinued operations.

business combinations acquisitions in fiscal year 2014
acquisition of perten instruments group ab. in december 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of perten. perten is a provider of analytical instruments and services for quality control of food, grain, flour and feed. we expect this acquisition to enhance our industrial, environmental and safety business by expanding our product offerings to the academic and industrial end markets. we paid the shareholders of perten $269.9 million in cash for the stock of perten. the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. we have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our environmental health segment from the acquisition date.
other acquisitions in fiscal year 2014. in addition to the perten acquisition, we completed the acquisition of two businesses in fiscal year 2014 for total consideration of $18.0 million in cash and $4.3 million of assumed debt. the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of each of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. we reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our human health and environmental health segments from the acquisition dates.
acquisitions in fiscal year 2013
during fiscal year 2013, we completed the acquisition of four businesses for total consideration of $11.4 million, in cash. as of the closing dates, we potentially had to pay additional contingent consideration for the four acquired businesses of up to $2.2 million, which at closing had an estimated fair value of $1.1 million. during fiscal year 2014, we paid $0.4 million in additional deferred consideration for one of these acquisitions. the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of each of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. we reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our human health and environmental health segments from the acquisition dates.
acquisition in fiscal year 2012
acquisition of shanghai haoyuan biotech co., ltd. in november 2012, we acquired all outstanding stock of shanghai haoyuan biotech co., ltd. ("haoyuan"). haoyuan is a provider of nucleic acid-based blood screening solutions for the blood banking and clinical diagnostics markets. we expect this acquisition to extend our capabilities into nucleic acid blood screening, as well as deepen our position in the growing molecular clinical diagnostics market in china. we paid the shareholders of haoyuan $38.0 million in cash for the stock of haoyuan. we recorded a receivable of $2.7 million from the shareholders of haoyuan as a reduction of purchase price for the settlement of certain contingencies. this receivable was collected in fiscal year 2013. as of the closing date, we potentially had to pay the shareholders additional contingent consideration of up to $30.0 million, which at closing had an estimated fair value of $1.9 million. the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. we reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our human health segment from the acquisition date.
we do not consider the acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, to be material to our consolidated results of operations; therefore, we are not presenting pro forma financial information of operations. we have also
37
determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of those acquisitions, from the date of acquisition, is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition.
as of december 28, 2014 the allocation of purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 were final. the preliminary allocation of the purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2014 were based upon initial valuations. our estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuations are subject to the collection of information necessary to complete our valuations within the measurement periods, which are up to one year from the respective acquisition dates. the primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances, and residual goodwill. we expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition dates during the measurement periods. during the measurement periods, we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of those dates. adjustments to the preliminary allocations of the purchase prices during the measurement period require the revision of comparative prior period financial information when reissued in subsequent financial statements. the effect of adjustments to the allocations of the purchase prices made during the measurement period would be as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition dates. the effects of any such adjustments, if material, may cause changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income or expense recognized in prior periods. all changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement periods are included in current period earnings.
allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations. the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash. increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period.
we may have to pay contingent consideration, related to all acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to $31.4 million as of december 28, 2014. as of december 28, 2014, we had recorded contingent consideration obligations relating to our acquisition of tetra teknolojik sistemler limited sirketi with an estimated fair value of $0.1 million. the earnout period for each of these acquisitions does not exceed three years from the respective acquisition date. if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed.
in connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions. the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition, and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date. the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation, plus a normal profit margin thereon. the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services. we do not include any costs associated with selling effort, research and development, or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. in most acquisitions, profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. the sum of the costs and operating income approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third-party to assume the obligation.
contingencies, including tax matters we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party ("prp") for certain waste disposal sites. we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. we have accrued $12.3 million and $13.5 million as of december 28, 2014 and december 29, 2013, respectively, which represents our management's estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. these amounts are recorded in
38
accrued expenses and other current liabilities. during fiscal year 2014, we recorded a benefit of $2.3 million for cost reimbursements related to a particular site, of which $1.2 million was for future monitoring and mitigation activities. during fiscal year 2013, we accrued an additional $5.7 million related to a particular site for increased monitoring and mitigation activities, of which $4.6 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. for sites where we have been named a prp, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. there have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.
various tax years after 2007 remain open to examination by certain tax jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, such as china, finland, germany, italy, netherlands, singapore, the united kingdom and the united states. the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits. we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in management's judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position.
we are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these contingencies at december 28, 2014 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k. however, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us.
reporting segment results of continuing operations in january 2015, we approved and announced a new alignment of our businesses effective for fiscal year 2015 that is designed to enable us to both deliver complete solutions targeted towards certain end markets and to develop value-added applications and solutions to foster further expansion of those markets. as part of this realignment, our onesource multivendor service offering business that serves the life sciences end market will be moved from our environmental health segment into our human health segment. beginning in fiscal year 2015, we will report financial results under our human health and environmental health segments using this new alignment.

2014 compared to 2013. revenue for fiscal year 2014 was $1,243.4 million, as compared to $1,201.1 million for fiscal year 2013, an increase of $42.3 million, or 4%, which includes an approximate 0.4% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and an approximate 1% decrease in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected revenue by product type for fiscal year 2014, as compared to fiscal year 2013, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. the increase in revenue in our human health segment was a result of an increase in diagnostics market revenue of $39.8 million and an increase in research market revenue of $2.5 million. as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $2.9 million of revenue in our human health segment for fiscal year 2014 and $7.3 million of revenue in our human health segment for fiscal year 2013 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods. this increase in our human health segment during fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to growth in our diagnostics business as birth rates increased and from continued expansion of our prenatal, newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in emerging markets such as china and brazil, as well as from increased demand for our medical imaging business' new wireless cassette detector used in diagnostic imaging and veterinary applications. in the research market we experienced growth related to our informatics, radiometric detection, and high-content screening offerings, as well as our microfluidics technology licensing program. this growth in the research market was offset by declines in some products in our research market due to weakness in the global academic end market, specifically in europe, as well as the expiration of certain patents in our licensing portfolio.

operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2014 was $220.2 million, as compared to $156.5 million for fiscal year 2013, an increase of $63.7 million, or 41%. amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $72.6 million for fiscal year 2014 as compared to $79.1 million for fiscal year 2013. restructuring and contract termination charges decreased and were $6.9 million for fiscal year 2014 as compared to $22.1 million for fiscal year 2013. impairment of assets was a charge of $0.2 million for fiscal year 2013 as the carrying amounts of certain long-lived assets were not recoverable and exceeded their fair value. acquisition related costs for integration, contingent consideration and other costs decreased expenses by $1.7 million for fiscal year 2014, as compared to adding an incremental expense of $1.4 million for fiscal year 2013. the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions was $0.2 million for fiscal year 2013. in addition to the factors noted above, increased sales volume in the diagnostics and research markets and cost containment and productivity initiatives increased operating income for fiscal year 2014.
2013 compared to 2012. revenue for fiscal year 2013 was $1,201.1 million, as compared to $1,164.6 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $36.5 million, or 3%, which includes an approximate 2% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and an approximate 0.3% decrease in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected revenue by product type for fiscal year 2013, as compared to fiscal year 2012, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. the increase in revenue in our human health segment was a result of an increase in diagnostics market revenue of $22.8 million and an increase in research market revenue of $13.7 million. as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $7.3 million of revenue in our human health segment for fiscal year 2013 and $26.2 million of revenue in our human health segment for fiscal year 2012 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods. this increase in our human health segment revenue during fiscal year 2013 was due to growth in the diagnostics market as birth rates in the united states increased and from continued expansion of our prenatal, newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the united states, particularly in emerging markets such as china, the middle east and africa, and korea, as well as increased demand for our informatics offerings and in-vivo imaging systems in the research market. this growth was partially offset by slight declines in our medical imaging business despite continued growth in our complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor imaging technology, as well as declines in our radiometric detection businesses within the research market, as a result of sequestration concerns in the united states, european austerity and weakening research markets in asia, particularly in japan.
operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2013 was $156.5 million, as compared to $63.8 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $92.7 million, or 145%. amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $79.1 million for fiscal year 2013 as compared to $79.7 million for fiscal year 2012. restructuring and contract termination charges increased and were $22.1 million for fiscal year 2013 as compared to $17.5 million for fiscal year 2012. impairment of assets was a charge of $0.2 million for fiscal year 2013 as the carrying amounts of certain long-lived assets were not recoverable and exceeded their fair value, as compared to $73.4 million for fiscal year 2012 as a result of a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy. acquisition related costs for integration, contingent consideration and other costs added an incremental expense of $1.4 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to an incremental expense of $0.1 million for fiscal year 2012. the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions was $0.2 million for fiscal year 2013, as compared to $5.2 million for fiscal year 2012. in addition to the factors noted above, increased sales volume in the diagnostics and research markets, favorable changes in product mix, and cost containment initiatives, increased operating income for fiscal year 2013, which was partially offset by higher costs related to growth and productivity investments.
environmental health
2014 compared to 2013. revenue for fiscal year 2014 was $993.8 million, as compared to $956.5 million for fiscal year 2013, an increase of $37.3 million, or 4%, which includes an approximate 1% decrease in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates and an approximate 1% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions. the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected revenue by product type for fiscal year 2014, as compared to fiscal year 2013, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. the increase in revenue in our environmental health segment was a result of an increase in revenue of $33.8 million from the laboratory services market and an increase in revenue of $3.5 million from the environmental and industrial markets. as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $0.01 million of revenue for fiscal year 2013 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods. this increase in our environmental health segment revenue during fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to continued growth in our laboratory services business, which included the addition of new customers to our onesource multivendor service offering. these increases were partially offset by decreased demand across some of our products in the environmental and industrial markets, primarily in the asian industrial end markets.

operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2014 was $109.1 million, as compared to $97.1 million for fiscal year 2013, an increase of $12.1 million, or 12%. amortization of intangible assets increased and was $10.8 million for fiscal year 2014 as compared to $10.1 million for fiscal year 2013. restructuring and contract termination charges decreased and were $6.5 million for fiscal year 2014 as compared to $11.8 million for fiscal year 2013. acquisition related costs for contingent consideration and other costs added an incremental expense of $2.1 million in fiscal year 2014, as compared to an incremental expense of $0.2 million for fiscal year 2013. the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions was $2.4 million for fiscal year 2014. in addition to the factors noted above, savings related to cost containment initiatives increased operating income for fiscal year 2014, which was partially offset by unfavorable changes in product mix, with an increase in sales of lower gross margin product offerings, and pricing pressure.
2013 compared to 2012. revenue for fiscal year 2013 was $956.5 million, as compared to $940.6 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $15.9 million or 2%, which includes an approximate 1% decrease in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates and an approximate 0.4% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions. the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected revenue by product type for fiscal year 2013, as compared to fiscal year 2012, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. the increase in revenue in our environmental health segment was a result of an increase in revenue of $23.2 million from the laboratory services market, partially offset by decreases in revenue of $7.3 million from the environmental and industrial markets. as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $0.01 million of revenue for fiscal year 2013 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods. this increase in our environmental health segment revenue during fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to growth in our laboratory services business by the addition of new customers to our onesource multivendor service offering, partially offset by decreased demand across some of our products in the environmental and industrial markets.
operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2013 was $97.1 million, as compared to $111.8 million for fiscal year 2012, a decrease of $14.8 million, or 13%. amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $10.1 million for fiscal year 2013 as compared to $10.4 million for fiscal year 2012. restructuring and contract termination charges increased and were $11.8 million for fiscal year 2013 as compared to $7.6 million for fiscal year 2012. impairment of assets decreased and was zero for fiscal year 2013 as compared to a charge of $0.7 million for fiscal year 2012 a result of a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy. acquisition related costs for contingent consideration and other costs added an incremental expense of $0.2 million for both fiscal years 2013 and 2012. in addition to the factors noted above, pricing pressure, unfavorable changes in product mix, with an increase in sales of lower gross margin product offerings, and increased costs related to growth investments decreased operating income for fiscal year 2013, which was partially offset by increased sales volume and cost containment and productivity initiatives liquidity and capital resources we require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. we anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, smaller acquisitions, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. however, we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due, any larger acquisitions and other long-term liabilities, such as contributions to our postretirement benefit plans.
principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:
•   changes in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and
•   changes in our working capital requirements.
principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:
•   financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,
•   increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,
•   a ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,
•   increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis,
41
•   a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and
•   volatility in the public debt and equity markets.

borrowing arrangements senior unsecured revolving credit facility. on january 8, 2014, we refinanced our debt held under a previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility and entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility. the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for $700.0 million of revolving loans and has an initial maturity of january 8, 2019. as of december 28, 2014, undrawn letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $12.2 million were treated as issued and outstanding under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility. as of december 28, 2014, we had $171.8 million available for additional borrowing under the new facility. we use the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances. the interest rates under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the eurocurrency rate or the base rate at the time of borrowing, plus a margin. the base rate is the higher of (i) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by jp morgan chase bank, n.a. as its "prime rate," (ii) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or (iii) one-month libor plus 1.00%. at december 28, 2014, borrowings under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility were accruing interest primarily based on the eurocurrency rate. the eurocurrency margin as of december 28, 2014 was 108 basis points. the weighted average eurocurrency interest rate as of december 28, 2014 was 0.18%, resulting in a weighted average effective eurocurrency rate, including the margin, of 1.26%. at december 28,
43
2014, we had $516.0 million of borrowings in u.s. dollars outstanding under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility. the credit agreement for the facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type and similar to those contained in the credit agreement for our previous facility. the financial covenants in our new senior unsecured revolving credit facility include a debt-to-capital ratio, and two contingent covenants, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, applicable if our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december 28, 2014. during fiscal year 2014, we capitalized $1.8 million of debt financing costs for the refinancing of debt held under our previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility. these debt financing costs are being amortized into interest and other expense, net, on a straight-line basis, over the term of the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
our previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility provided for $700.0 million of revolving loans and had an initial maturity of december 16, 2016. at december 29, 2013, we had $397.0 million of borrowings in u.s. dollars outstanding under the previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility. the credit agreement for the previous facility contained affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type and similar to those contained in our new credit facility.
5% senior unsecured notes due in 2021. on october 25, 2011, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2021 in a registered public offering and received $496.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance. the 2021 notes were issued at 99.372% of the principal amount, which resulted in a discount of $3.1 million. as of december 28, 2014, the 2021 notes had an aggregate carrying value of $497.7 million, net of $2.3 million of unamortized original issue discount. as of december 29, 2013, the 2021 notes had an aggregate carrying value of $497.4 million, net of $2.6 million of unamortized original issue discount. the 2021 notes mature in november 2021 and bear interest at an annual rate of 5%. interest on the 2021 notes is payable semi-annually on may 15th and november 15th each year. prior to august 15, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), we may redeem the 2021 notes in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect to the 2021 notes being redeemed, discounted on a semi-annual basis, at the treasury rate plus 45 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest. at any time on or after august 15, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), we may redeem the 2021 notes, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the 2021 notes ) and a contemporaneous downgrade of the 2021 notes below investment grade, each holder of 2021 notes will have the right to require us to repurchase such holder's 2021 notes for 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december 28, 2014.
financing lease obligations. in fiscal year 2012, we entered into agreements with the lessors of certain buildings that we are currently occupying and leasing to expand those buildings. we provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings, and as a result we are considered the owner of the buildings during the construction period. at the end of the construction period, we were not reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs. we are therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases qualify as financing leases under sale-leaseback accounting guidance, representing debt obligations for us and non-cash investing and financing activities. as a result, we capitalized $29.3 million in property and equipment, net, representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt. we have also capitalized $11.5 million in additional construction costs necessary to complete the renovations to the buildings, which were funded by the lessors, with a corresponding increase to debt. at december 28, 2014, we had $39.3 million recorded for these financing lease obligations, of which $1.1 million was recorded as short-term debt and $38.2 million was recorded as long-term debt. at december 29, 2013, we had $40.3 million recorded for these financing lease obligations, of which $2.6 million was recorded as short-term debt and $37.7 million was recorded as long-term debt. the buildings are being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values, which will equal the remaining financing obligation at the end of the lease term. at the end of the lease term, the remaining balances in property, plant and equipment, net and debt will be reversed against each other.
dividends our board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2014 and 2013, resulting in an annual dividend rate of $0.28 per share. at december 28, 2014, we had accrued $7.9 million for dividends declared on october 23, 2014 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, payable in february 2015. on january 23, 2015, we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 that will be payable in may 2015. in the future, our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.

____________________________
(1)   the credit facility borrowings carry variable interest rates; the amount included in this table does not include interest obligations.
(2)   the 2021 notes include interest obligations. as of december 28, 2014 the 2021 notes had a carrying value of $497.7 million.
(3)   the financing lease obligations do not include interest obligations.
(4)   employee benefit payments only include obligations through fiscal year 2024.
(5)   we do not expect to cash settle any uncertain tax positions during fiscal year 2015. we have excluded $14.0 million, including accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties, from the amount related to our uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments.
capital expenditures during fiscal year 2015, we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2014, primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, and to develop information technology. we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures.
other potential liquidity considerations at december 28, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $174.8 million, of which $170.3 million was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, and we had $171.8 million of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. we had no other liquid investments at december 28, 2014.
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. of the $170.3 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries at december 28, 2014, we would incur u.s. taxes on approximately $157.1 million if transferred to the u.s. without proper planning. we expect the accumulated non-u.s. cash balances, which may not be transferred to the u.s. without incurring u.s. taxes, will remain outside of the u.s. and that we will meet u.s. liquidity needs through future cash flows, use of u.s. cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources.
on october 24, 2012, our board authorized us to repurchase up to 6.0 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the "repurchase program"). the repurchase program expired on october 24, 2014. on october 23, 2014, our board authorized us to repurchase up to 8.0 million shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the "new repurchase program"). the new repurchase program will expire on october 23, 2016 unless terminated earlier by our board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. during fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $61.3 million, including commissions, under these repurchase programs. as of december 28, 2014, approximately 7.4 million shares authorized by our board under the new repurchase program remained available for repurchase.
our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive
45
plans. during fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 98,269 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $4.3 million.
the repurchased shares have been reflected as a reduction in shares outstanding, but remain available to be reissued with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs. if we continue to repurchase shares, the new repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability, creating increased volatility in security prices, widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments. the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold. increases in credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable, could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. in difficult global financial markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities.
our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets. we expect to contribute $20.0 million, in the aggregate, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, for the 2014 plan year to one of our plans within the united states. with respect to plans outside of the united states, we expect to contribute $10.2 million in the aggregate during fiscal year 2015. we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans. during fiscal year 2014, we contributed $11.2 million, in the aggregate, to plans outside of the united states. during fiscal year 2013, we made contributions of $37.0 million for the 2012 plan year to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states. during fiscal year 2013, we contributed $20.2 million, in the aggregate, to plans outside of the united states, which includes an additional contribution of $10.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom. we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans. in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, we notified employees of our intention to terminate their employment as part of the q3 2014 restructuring plan. the removal of these participants may decrease the expected future service lives in excess of the curtailment limit for one of our pension plans, which would result in a curtailment gain. if the curtailment occurs, the curtailment will be measured and recorded when the notified employees are separated from us. as part of a curtailment, we are required to remeasure the pension plan's assets and liabilities based upon current discount rates and the fair value of the pension plan's assets as of the curtailment date, which may result in an additional gain or (loss) in addition to the curtailment gain. employee separation is expected to be completed during the first half of fiscal year 2015.
effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements from time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates. unless otherwise discussed, such pronouncements did not have or will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to our operations.
in april 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no. 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. under this new guidance, only disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have, or will have, a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results will be presented as discontinued operations. the standard also requires new disclosures related to individually significant disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. the provisions of this guidance are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2014. we will utilize this new guidance when reporting new discontinued operations or disclosing new disposals in our future filings.
in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. under this new guidance, an entity uses a five-step process to recognize revenue, which depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the standard also requires new disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. the provisions of this guidance are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016. we are evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, warranty costs, bad debts, inventories, accounting for business combinations and dispositions, long-lived assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition. we record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. for products that include installation, and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, we recognize product revenue upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete. for revenue that includes customer-specified acceptance criteria, we recognize revenue after the acceptance criteria have been met. certain of our products require specialized installation. revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed. we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period, or as services are rendered.
in limited circumstances, we have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time, such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component, including cord blood processing and storage. for these arrangements, the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a selling-price hierarchy. a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. a delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting. the selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") if such evidence is available, third-party evidence ("tpe") if vsoe is not available, and management's best estimate of selling price ("besp") if neither vsoe nor tpe are available. tpe is the price of our or any competitor's largely interchangeable products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly-situated customers. besp is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis, considering market conditions and entity-specific factors.
revenue from software licenses and services was 5% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2014, 5% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2013, and 3% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2012. we sell our software licenses with maintenance services and, in some cases, also with consulting services. for the undelivered elements, we determine vsoe of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately. we determine vsoe for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the amount that was separately charged for the maintenance renewal period. we determine vsoe for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements when a software license sale is not involved.
we recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance and/or consulting services upon shipment using the residual method, provided that the above criteria have been met. if vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established, we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered, or if the only undelivered element is maintenance, then we recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period.
the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long-term customized projects, therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. further, we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation.
warranty costs. we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. warranty liabilities are estimated using expected future repair costs based on historical labor and material costs incurred during the warranty period.
allowances for doubtful accounts. we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (i) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (ii) specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty. therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. this would reduce our earnings. accounts are written-off only when all methods of recovery have been exhausted.
47
inventory valuation. we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and/or manufacture. we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. generally, reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand, or technological obsolescence of the inventory. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements, or historical trailing usage of the product. if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. this would reduce our earnings. if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.
business combinations. business combinations are accounted for at fair value. acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest; in-process research and development ("ipr&d") is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense. all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings. the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed.
value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles. we carry a variety of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. we undertake this review (i) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets and (ii) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished. any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. the goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process. the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. through fiscal year 2014, we conducted annual goodwill impairment assessments for our reporting units. we completed the annual goodwill impairment test using measurement dates of january 1, 2014 and january 1, 2013, and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment. at january 1, 2014, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 90.0% for each reporting unit, with the exception of the life sciences and technology reporting unit where the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 11.0%. the carrying value of the goodwill for the life sciences and technology reporting unit was $796.3 million, at the annual impairment date for fiscal year 2014. during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014, we realigned our organization which resulted in a change in the composition of our reporting units within the human health segment. our informatics business was moved from the life sciences and technology reporting unit to its own reporting unit, and we reallocated $220.3 million of goodwill to the informatics reporting unit based on the relative fair value of each of these businesses. we concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment for either the life sciences and technology reporting unit or the informatics reporting unit as the fair value exceeded the carrying value for each of these reporting units as of the date of the realignment. while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve, impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future.
non-amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the non-amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount. if the carrying amount of a non-amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized. in addition, we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non-amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment. these intangible assets will
48
then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. in fiscal year 2012, as part of integrating our recent acquisitions, we decided that prospectively we would primarily focus on the perkinelmer trade name. accordingly, we undertook a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy, which resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of $74.2 million in fiscal year 2012. we concluded that the impairment for trade names was not a triggering event for goodwill because the impairment occurred as a result of our decision to phase out certain trade names. we do not believe that our future cash flows will be significantly impacted by these changes. during fiscal year 2013, we recorded a charge of $0.2 million for the impairment of certain long-lived assets within our human health segment, as the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets were not recoverable and exceeded their fair value. these non-cash impairments of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, have been recorded as a separate component of operating expenses.
employee compensation and benefits. we sponsor both funded and unfunded u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business, and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future, and therefore are subject to estimation. retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statements of operations. we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter, unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement.
we recognized a loss of $77.7 million in fiscal year 2014, income of $18.2 million in fiscal year 2013 and a loss of $35.3 million in fiscal year 2012 for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, which includes the charge for the mark-to-market adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the gain or expense related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans was a pre-tax loss of $75.9 million in fiscal year 2014, pre-tax income of $17.6 million in fiscal year 2013 and a pre-tax loss of $31.8 million in fiscal year 2012. we expect income of approximately $0.2 million in fiscal year 2015 for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, excluding the charge for or benefit from the mark-to-market adjustment or the potential additional curtailment gain. it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a mark-to-market adjustment in fiscal year 2015. mark-to-market adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control, including changes in interest rates, the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions. to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease, mark-to market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2015. conversely, to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected, mark-to market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2015. pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee's approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year.
as of december 28, 2014, we estimate the expected long-term rate of return on assets in our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 7.25% and to be 4.60% for all plans outside the united states. in addition, as of december 28, 2014 we estimate the discount rate for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 4.07% and to be 2.75% for all plans outside the united states. for our plans in the united states, as of december 28, 2014 we adopted the new mortality base table, rp-2014, with projection scale, mp-2014, that was published by the society of actuaries in 2014. the adoption of the new mortality base table resulted in a $32.1 million increase to the projected benefit obligation at december 28, 2014. we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans' historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets, as well as our current expectations for long-term rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets. our management will continue to assess the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions, and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. discount rate assumptions have been, and continue to be, based on the prevailing market long-term interest rates corresponding with expected benefit payments at the measurement date.
49
if any of our assumptions were to change as of december 28, 2014, our pension plan expenses would also change.

we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001. under the defined dollar plan feature, our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount, regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree. our maximum future liability, therefore, cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare.
restructuring activities. our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals. our pre-tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of (i) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit formulas and contractual agreements, (ii) costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub-rental income and (iii) impairment of assets as discussed above under "value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles." because these accruals are estimates, they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention. for example, actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance, or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected. in addition, unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates. when such changes in estimates occur, they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled "restructuring and contract termination charges, net."
dispositions. when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation, we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition. this estimate is based on a variety of factors, including current interest in the market, alternative markets for the assets, and other relevant factors. if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we record a loss. if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated. accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first estimated. during the fiscal year ended december 28, 2014, we recorded $0.3 million in pre-tax losses from the disposition of discontinued operations. any such changes decrease or increase current earnings.
income taxes. our business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions, and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries. we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions. any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate.
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. in the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain. furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits. adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount; and/or (iii) the

statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position. any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, or our cash flow.
additionally, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including state net operating loss carryforwards, state income tax credit carryforwards, and certain foreign tax attributes. valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. in projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. changes in our assumptions regarding the appropriate amount for valuation allowances could result in the increase or decrease in the valuation allowance, with a corresponding charge or benefit to our tax provision.
taxes have not been provided on unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries that we consider indefinitely reinvested because we plan to keep these amounts indefinitely reinvested overseas except for instances where we can remit such earnings to the u.s. without an associated net tax cost. our indefinite reinvestment determination is based on the future operational and capital requirements of our u.s. and non-u.s. operations. as of december 28, 2014, the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the u.s. indefinitely and for which no u.s. tax cost has been provided was approximately $675.0 million. it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings.

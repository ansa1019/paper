executive overview factset is a provider of integrated financial information and analytical applications to the global investment community. we combine content regarding companies and securities from major markets all over the globe into a single online platform of information and analytics. by consolidating content from hundreds of databases with powerful analytics, factset supports the investment process from initial research to published results for buy and sell-side professionals. these professionals include portfolio managers, research and performance analysts, risk managers, marketing professionals, sell-side equity research professionals, investment bankers and fixed income professionals. our applications provide users access to company analysis, multicompany comparisons, industry analysis, company screening, portfolio analysis, predictive risk measurements, alphatesting, portfolio optimization and simulation, real-time news and quotes and tools to value and analyze fixed income securities and portfolios. with microsoft office integration, wireless access and customizable options, we offer a complete financial workflow solution. our revenues are derived from month-to-month subscriptions to services, databases and financial applications. investment management clients account for 82.6% of our annual subscription value ("asv"), with the remainder from investment banking firms that perform m&a advisory work, capital markets services and equity research.
fiscal 2014 was a successful year for factset and represented our 36th year of operation, our 34th consecutive year of positive revenue growth and our 18th consecutive year of positive earnings growth as a public company. by almost any measure, the second half of fiscal 2014 was one of our strongest six months in the past decade as our key financial and operating metrics rose across the board. our record financial results were driven by relentless investment in our unique suite of products and services, including our innovative financial applications, proprietary content, and industry-leading client-service business model. revenues rose to $920 million, while diluted earnings per share grew 11% to $4.92. we added 200 net new clients during fiscal 2014, our highest annual growth total ever. we generated high levels of free cash flow with our fiscal 2014 totaling $247 million, comparable to $251 million generated a year ago. we also continued to invest heavily in our people, which is a major component of operating expenses and the foundation of factset's dedication to its clients. in the last 12 months, we hired 381 net new employees for a total headcount of 6,639 employees as of august 31, 2014, an increase of 6% from a year ago. our annual client retention rate was greater than 95% of asv and rose to 93% in terms of the number of actual clients, up from 92% last year, again highlighting our continued focus on providing valuable workflow solutions for our clients. we have been successful in expanding our market share against both internal client built systems and competitor products.

2014 year in review growth during fiscal 2014 was driven by delivering workflow solutions to our clients, improvements in the functionality of our product line including portfolio analytics, expansion of our proprietary data, persistent focus on client service, stabilization of our sell-side business and enhancements to our technological infrastructure. as a result, each of our key operating metrics experienced growth over the past 12 months. organic asv grew 7.3% as we added 200 net new clients and 3,628 users since august 31, 2013. we continued to hire around the world, welcoming a total of 381 employees to our workforce and increased our regular quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.39 per share. aggregating dividends with share repurchases, we returned $341 million to stockholders during fiscal 2014.
we also successfully changed factset's leadership structure to position us well for future success. philip snow was named president, effective july 1, 2014 and will be leading our sales and operations teams. the expected result is to generate more collaboration between these two teams and expand on our competitive position in the financial information industry.
fiscal 2014 also included the acquisition of two privately held companies. in september 2013, we acquired revere data llc, a leading provider of industry classification and supply chain data, analytics, and index solutions. we are selling this information as a data feed and have also incorporated the supply chain data into our online offerings. we also acquired matrix solutions in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, which offers mutual fund market share for the uk fund distribution industry and complements our market metrics offering. both acquisitions have served to enhance legacy products with unique data sets which have been well received by our clients.
growth across all geographies and key metrics fiscal 2014 marks another successful year, with the second half of fiscal 2014 representing one of our strongest six month periods within the past decade, as many of our financial and operating metrics experienced solid growth across the board. our just completed fourth quarter produced our best quarter in terms of net client additions as we added more clients on a net basis then we have ever done before. during fiscal 2014, we added a total of 200 net new clients, an increase of 85% over the number of net new client added a year ago.

product developments to enhance our workflow solutions at factset, we are dedicated to building tools to support the workflows of our traditional asset management and investment banking base, as well as to extend our core competency to encompass wealth managers, sales & trading, private equity, and hedge funds. in order to achieve this goal, we set aggressive goals for fiscal 2014 that involved improving the ease of use and speed of our entire product line. we invested heavily in new data center technologies, as well as our mobile platforms, including factset for the ipad and the iphone. our goal is to make factset a critical component of the daily workflow for all user classes, from the most data-intensive quantitative analyst to c-level executives at our clients.
our major fiscal 2014 product developments are highlighted as follows:
●   factset multi-asset class (mac) risk model - the mac risk model opens risk management up to a new range of asset classes. clients can now model predictive risks in a variety of markets and assess the impact of any shock on equities, bonds, commodities, and currencies simultaneously.

●   security trading utility - this enhancement to our fixed income trade simulation utility allows bond portfolio managers to simulate a trade before execution.

●   internal research notes - factset can now be used as an internal document management system to store and share research insights. this powerful concept can drive usage and user growth; clients now seamlessly integrate their own internal news feeds within factset product and then share insights with colleagues across the hall or across the globe.

●   revere supply chain report - following the revere acquisition, we introduced the factset revere database, which encompasses a comprehensive collection of business relationships to provide visibility into a company's supply chain. revere data gives clients insight into the complex network of companies' key customers, suppliers, competitors, and strategic partners.

another key development in our continual quest to enhance the factset workstation was created through a new agreement we entered into with quick corporation, a japan-based financial information services company in the nikkei inc. group. together, factset and quick will work to integrate the nikkei group's high-quality content with our own global content and workflow solutions in order to provide a premium factset service for redistribution within our asia segment.
22
faster technology during fiscal 2014, we made great strides in the execution of project nexgen. nextgen is our ongoing assessment of the technologies we use to build, support, and deploy factset product. we continued our mission to evolve away from large mainframe computers to a more distributed environment powered by a vast array of smaller, faster, and more cost-effective machines. throughout the year, we converted several front-end products and major subsystems to make use of our new technology platform, in many cases with dramatic improvements in computational speed and ease of use. we also continued our investment in the state-of-the-art grid of servers and software systems that support our industry-leading fixed income analytics platform, fixed income analytical services ("fias"). our new fias service allows our clients to outsource a significant portion of their fixed income data validation and reconciliation process to factset, helping to improve the quality of our fixed income portfolio analysis product line.
refinement of our proprietary content as our database product lines mature, we are no longer focused on hiring massive numbers of collection specialists. we now have the opportunity to refine our collection processes. the net effect of collecting data more efficiently is improved timeliness, accuracy, and coverage; all of which have translated into increased usage of our proprietary content.
fiscal 2014 enhancements to our proprietary content are highlighted as follows:
●   factset fundamentals - our collection software system has migrated to superfast, which replaces the previous software version. this new system accomplishes four key objectives: quality improvement; efficiency of data collection; reduction in the cost; and an easier path to innovative new products based on fundamental data.

●   factset economics estimate database -is a new content set comprised of consensus estimates for weekly, monthly, and quarterly estimates from nearly 300 global contributors, covering 460 concepts across 15 countries.

●   factset revere - revere's classification, hierarchy, and supply chain data is now available in our workstation. by leveraging this data, clients can help better identify investment opportunities and measure risk exposure.

●   factset streetaccount - coverage was expanded to include europe, canada, and south africa during fiscal 2014. in addition, the streetaccount drug database offers a unique dataset with information on prescription drugs and biologics.

●   debt capital structure - improved content now includes intra-period capitalization changes due to bond issuance, bank loan data, and bond terms and condition content.

●   factset sharp estimates -allows for a more accurate and timely portrayal of projected corporate earnings in light of a significant event impacting a given company's profitability. the improved data content set can identify events that trigger estimate changes by a subset of analyst.

continued focus on client service client service is a key component of our business model. we support our software with a team of financial data and modeling experts. client service is performed each and every day via email, text, instant messaging, or phone. client touches are a key metric by which we measure the success of our service. according to our fiscal 2014 global client satisfaction survey, 97% of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with factset's support. the depth of our software, the data behind the models, and the complex mathematics behind the answers each create an opportunity for us to forge close working relationships with our user community.
our reward for investing in a consulting group comprised of several hundred professionals is client loyalty, as evidenced by an annual client retention rate of greater than 95% of asv for several years in a row. our consulting teams have been trained to listen to our clients' needs and transfer this knowledge directly to the product development teams, helping us transform suggestions into new or enhanced product offerings. educating our clients is also an important component of our service. not only do we teach our users the nuances of our software and content offerings, but factset personnel are often thought-leaders in a particular area of financial modeling in our rapidly evolving industry. as a result, clients look to factset as a trusted partner to stay on the cutting edge of financial modeling and analysis. during fiscal 2014, nearly 1,800 clients attended live or online factset training sessions; more than 4,000 investment bankers were trained on how to use our systems; clients completed 34,000 elearning courses in our online library; and clients referenced our online help and reference library nearly 700,000 times.

revenues fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
revenues in fiscal 2014 were $920.3 million, up 7.3% compared to fiscal 2013. our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2014 were increases in clients and users, continued growth in our portfolio analytics suite of products, rising sales of our wealth management workflow solution, expansion of proprietary content, stabilization within sell-side client base and incremental revenues from the recent acquisitions of revere and matrix.
growth in the number of clients and users of factset during fiscal 2014 we added 200 net new clients as compared to 108 added during 2013, bringing our total client count to 2,743 as of august 31, 2014. this growth represents an 85% increase in net client additions during the last twelve months as compared to the same period one year ago. included in our august 31, 2014 client count are 43 clients acquired from the recent revere and matrix acquisitions. during the just completed fourth quarter, our total client count expanded by 81 compared to 60 in the same period a year ago. the addition of new clients is important to us as we anticipate that it lays the groundwork for the ability to provide additional services in the future, consistent with our strategy of increasing sales of workstations, applications and content at our existing clients. our client growth during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 marked the highest number of client additions that we have ever obtained within a single quarter. annual client retention as of august 31, 2014 was greater than 95% of asv and 93% when expressed as a percentage of clients, an increase from 92% as of the end of fiscal 2013 and our first increase in that metric since august 2011. we believe these statistics underscore the power of our business model, as the large majority of our clients maintain their subscriptions to factset throughout each year. at august 31, 2014, our largest individual client accounted for 2% of total subscriptions and annual subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not surpass 15% of total client subscriptions, consistent with prior fiscal years.
at august 31, 2014, there were 54,596 professionals using factset, an increase of 3,628 users from a year ago. during the last twelve months, our investment management clients added 3,449 net new users, while our investment banking clients added 179 net new users. our user count within the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 alone increased by 2,113 users compared to 1,409 in the year ago fourth quarter, marking this our largest quarterly increase in over three years, with significant additions coming from both our investment management and banking clients. we observed higher than expected new hire classes at our banking clients as new users increased by 179 compared to a contraction of 35 users during fiscal 2013. we believe this increase is due to observed improvements in the ipo and m&a marketplaces coupled with benefits realized from the reinvestment in our wealth management and portfolio analytics suite of products in order to enhance value for our sell-side clients. as of august 31, 2014, our sell-side clients represent 17.4% of our asv.
increased subscriptions in our portfolio analytics ("pa") suite of products our portfolio analytics suite of products, including our fixed income in pa product, continues to be well received within our client base and was a source of revenue growth for fiscal 2014. the pa suite covers a wide range of workflows around portfolios. during fiscal 2014, we saw increased demand from our clients for tools to assist them with multi-asset risk modeling, which we addressed through the 2014 release of our mac risk model, in addition to enhancements to our equity and fixed-income analytics reporting and attribution products. we have experienced success in marketing workstations to our users interested in investing in equities and corporate debt, requiring a focus on credit analysis. addressing this need, we introduced several improvements to our suite of reports covering debt and liquidity analysis during fiscal 2014.
24
in addition to the enhancements to our pa products, the total number of clients and users subscribing to this suite of products continued to grow. we believe this steady growth indicates that our suite remains comprehensive and has highly desired applications for portfolio attribution, risk, quantitative analysis, portfolio publishing and returns based, style analysis. we continue to see existing clients expand their use of our pa and buy more services that integrate within the portfolio analytics suite.
continued sales of our wealth management workflow solution wealth management continued to be a growing area for us during fiscal 2014, as our wealth management clients and users benefit from the ability to tailor our workstations to accommodate their needs and improve their competitive position. in the past fiscal year, we have focused product suite and sales teams to address the workflows of these particular clients. aiming to deliver the value-added service and comprehensive, easy to generate reports, our wealth management clients continue to express interest in products which are not included within the standard wealth management packages we offer. we have found that our clients are using more of our pa suite of products in a manner similar to institutional investors. this usage has helped continue our trend of increasing wealth management users for the past five years.
expansion of our proprietary content we continue to be successful in licensing our proprietary factset data, especially factset fundamentals and factset estimates as our global content sales team pursues expanding the distribution of our content. this type of data is licensed in feed form and includes ownership, transcripts, m&a and corporate hierarchy data. data feeds are consumed by a wide-range of clients, including existing large factset clients and some outside of our core client base that do not manage money or provide sell-side services. expansion of our data feed business has created new revenue opportunities for us and with the improvement in our database technology and faster networks, many clients have a desire to import and analyze data on their own. as a result, we have created the technology and content infrastructure to deliver standard or highly customized data feeds for our clients.
in addition, streetaccount, our condensed news product, sells strongly across all factset user types and continues to be in demand due to the ability of our clients to receive up-to-the-minute news offered both through and outside the factset workstation. another source of growth within our content set is factset revere. revere's classification, hierarchy, and supply chain data is now available in the factset workstation. by leveraging this data, clients can help better identify investment opportunities and measure risk exposure. lastly, in may 2014, we signed an agreement with quick corp. to develop a premium factset service for redistribution in asia by combining our industry-leading global content and workflow solutions with the nikkei group's high-quality content.
stabilization within sell-side client base asv from our investment banking clients increased 1.6% during fiscal 2014 as we observed improvements in the ipo and m&a marketplaces coupled with benefits realized from the reinvestment in our wealth management and portfolio analytics suite of products in order to enhance value for our sell-side clients. as of august 31, 2014, our sell-side clients represented 17.4% of our asv. in addition, we experience some seasonality with our investment banking side clients, with our fourth quarter typically a strong quarter for new banking hires. we saw this trend in the just completed fourth quarter as user count at our investment banking clients increased by 1,252 professionals during the past three months.
incremental revenue from the acquisitions of revere and matrix in september 2013 we acquired the assets of revere data, whose taxonomy and supply chain relationship data complements our commitment to provide our clients with unique and insightful content sets. at the time of the acquisition, revere had annual subscriptions of $5 million. during the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired matrix solutions, whose primary line of business is to provide intelligence to the uk financial services industry and complements our market metrics business. at the time of the acquisition, matrix had annual subscriptions of $7 million. the acquisitions of revere and matrix increased our global revenue growth rate by 145 basis points during fiscal 2014.
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
revenues in fiscal 2013 were $858.1 million, up 6.5% compared to fiscal 2012. revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2013 were the use of our advanced applications such as pa, growth in our client count and total users, incremental revenue from the acquisition of streetaccount in june 2012, the expansion of our market metrics business, growth of our proprietary content sales and increased usage of our wealth management workflow solutions.

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
revenues from our u.s. segment increased 6.4% to $624.6 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $586.9 million a year ago. revenue growth was driven by the addition of users and clients, sales of our pa suite of products, growth in our wealth management solutions, increased demand for our proprietary content, and increment revenue from the revere acquisition, which increased our u.s. growth rate by 80 basis points. revenue growth was partially offset by a contraction in the market metrics business during fiscal 2014, which lowered our u.s. growth rate by 60 basis points.
international revenues increased 9.0% to $295.7 million during fiscal 2014. excluding foreign currency effects and the matrix acquisition, the year over year international revenue growth rate was 6.7%, comprised of 5.0% for europe and 12.2% for asia pacific. revenues from international operations accounted for 32.1% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2014, up from 31.6% a year ago primarily as a result of incremental revenues from the matrix acquisition.
european revenues advanced 8.9% year over year due to sales of our advanced applications, additional users and clients and incremental revenue from the matrix acquisition, which increased the european growth rate by 360 basis points. the asia pacific revenue growth rate of 9.4% was primarily due to our ability to sell our global content, expansion into new markets within asia, selling additional services to existing clients, and new client and user growth partially offset by a weaker japanese yen, which lowered the asia pacific revenue growth rate by 280 basis points.
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
our u.s. segment revenues increased 6.6% to $586.9 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. our revenue growth rate in the u.s. was the result of increased sales of advanced applications such as pa, growth in client count and total users, expansion of the market metrics business, growth in wealth management workflow solutions and incremental revenues from the acquisition of streetaccount in june 2012. international revenues rose 6.2% from fiscal 2012 due to a broad selection of global proprietary content, clients licensing advanced applications and increases in user and client counts. the impact from foreign currency decreased international revenues in fiscal 2013 by 80 basis points. european revenues advanced 5.8% to $208.8 million while asia pacific revenues grew 7.8% to $62.4 million. holding currencies constant, the asia pacific revenue growth in fiscal 2013 was 11.3%.

asv from our u.s. operations was $651.2 million, up 6.7% organically from a year ago. international asv totaled $312.4 million as of august 31, 2014, up 8.3% organically from a year ago and represented 32.4% of our company-wide total. the percentage of our total asv derived from buy-side clients increased from 81.6% a year ago to 82.6% at august 31, 2014. organic asv growth rates from buy and sell-side clients rose to 8.5% and 1.6%, respectively.
26
the 7.3% increase in organic asv during fiscal 2014 was driven by the addition of 200 new clients and 3,628 users, which included the effects of higher than expected new hire classes at our banking clients, growth in sales to our wealth management clients, increased demand for our pa products and expanded sales of our proprietary content. organic asv growth of 7.3% excludes $12 million of asv acquired from revere and matrix during fiscal 2014 and a $0.5 million detriment from foreign currency.
fiscal 2013 growth in organic asv of $49 million, or 5.9%, excludes the impact from foreign currency, primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar versus the japanese yen. the rise in asv in 2013 was driven by continued growth of pa, the addition of 108 net new clients and 1,425 new users, the expansion of our market metrics business, a rise in proprietary content sales and increased usage of our wealth management workflow solutions.
we believe that our asv growth of 7.3% in fiscal 2014 and 5.9% in fiscal 2013 highlight the stability and strength of our subscription business model. we continue to focus on expanding the business by providing superior analytical applications, premier global content and unparalleled client service.

* sg&a expenses in fiscal 2013 include an incremental $16.4 million from the vesting of performance-based stock options granted in connection with the acquisition of market metrics and streetaccount.
cost of services fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
cost of services increased 15.4% to $353.7 million as compared to the same period a year ago. expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of services was 38.4% in fiscal 2014, an increase of 270 basis points from a year ago. the increase was driven by higher employee compensation, additional third party data costs and incremental costs from the revere and matrix acquisitions, partially offset by lower computer-related expenses, including depreciation.
employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased 300 basis points during fiscal 2014. excluding compensation attributable to the acquired revere and matrix workforces, the increase in employee compensation was 250 basis points and due to increased employee headcount and providing annual employee base salary increases. since september 1, 2013, we have hired 202 net new software engineers and 70 net new consultants who are dedicated to the development, enhancement and support of our products. third party data costs when expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points during fiscal 2014. many of our data contracts are driven by our user and client count, so as we continue to grow in these metrics, so do our data-related costs. user count rose by 7% while clients grew 10% year over year, thus driving up our third party data costs. expenses associated with the operations of revere and matrix increased cost of services, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, by 80 basis points during fiscal 2014 due to compensation paid to the acquired workforce, stock-based compensation from equity based awards granted, incremental third party data costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets.
partially offsetting the growth in cost of services during fiscal 2014 was a reduction in computer-related expenses. computer-related expenses, including computer depreciation and maintenance costs, decreased 30 basis points in fiscal 2014 as compared to a year ago due to the continued use of fully depreciated equipment and our transition to more efficient and cost-effective servers in our data centers.
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
cost of services increased 11.2% to $306.4 million in fiscal 2013 compared to $275.5 million in fiscal 2012. cost of services, expressed as a percentage of revenues, was 35.7% in 2013, which was 150 basis points higher than fiscal 2012 due to higher employee compensation expense associated with new hires in consulting, engineering and content, additional streetaccount expenses and increased stock-based compensation partially offset by lower third party data costs.
employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased 190 basis points during fiscal 2013 as compared to 2012 due to new hires in software engineering and consulting, increased headcount in our proprietary content collection operations located in india and the philippines and salary increases year over year.
27
excluding $6.9 million of compensation attributable to the streetaccount workforce, the increase in employee compensation was 110 basis points over fiscal 2012. during 2013, we increased headcount at our collection facilities in india and the philippines by 408, added approximately 98 net new engineering and product development employees and 49 net new consultants. streetaccount expenses increased cost of services by approximately 100 basis points in fiscal 2013 due to compensation paid to the acquired workforce, stock-based compensation expense from equity based awards granted to the new employees and the amortization of acquired intangible assets.
partially offsetting the growth in cost of services during fiscal 2013 were lower levels of third party data costs. data costs, expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased 20 basis points in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due to a slower growth rate in users, a reduction in callstreet third party collection fees, lower variable fees payable to data vendors based on deployment of their content over the factset platform partially offset by incremental market metrics data collection costs.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a)
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
sg&a expenses decreased 6.3% to $264.4 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to $282.3 million in 2013. expressed as a percentage of revenues, sg&a expenses decreased 420 basis points to 28.7% for fiscal 2014 due to lower employee compensation, including stock-based compensation partially offset by higher employee travel and entertainment ("t&e") expenses.
employee compensation when expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 440 basis points from fiscal 2013 due to a higher percentage of our employee base working in a cost of services capacity versus sg&a and a prior year stock-based compensation charge of $16.4 million from the vesting of market metrics and streetaccount performance-based options. of our total employee headcount increase in fiscal 2014, 79% was within our software engineering, content collection and product development teams, which are all included within cost of services. as such, sg&a employee compensation declined compared to the growth in cost of services.
partially offsetting the overall decrease in sg&a expenses was higher t&e expense, which rose by 20 basis points when expressed as a percentage of revenues. the primary drivers for this increase were more client visits by our salesforce, higher plane and hotel prices and increased interoffice travel due to our expanding worldwide presence.
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
sg&a expenses increased 9.7% in fiscal 2013 as compared to 2012. expressed as a percentage of revenues, sg&a expenses increased 100 basis points to 32.9% in 2013 due to incremental stock-based compensation from the vesting of the market metrics and streetaccount performance-based stock options partially offset by a decline in variable employee compensation. due to the vesting of performance-based stock options granted in connection with the acquisition of the market metrics and streetaccount businesses, an incremental $16.4 million in stock-based compensation expense was recognized in sg&a during fiscal 2013. the incremental $16.4 million of stock-based compensation increased sg&a expenses, expressed as a percentage of revenues, from 31.0% to 32.9%.
operating income and operating margin fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
operating income increased 12.2% to $302.2 million in fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year. our operating margin for fiscal 2014 was 32.8%, up from 31.4% a year ago. the fiscal 2013 market metrics and streetaccount performance-based stock option charge of $18.3 million ($1.9 million within cost of services and $16.4 million in sg&a) reduced our fiscal 2013 operating margin by 210 basis points. it is our philosophy to expand profitability over the long-term by reinvesting in the company to grow the top-line as opposed to expanding our operating margin. our industry is highly competitive, so we must continue to invest in our services in order to maintain our position as a premium provider of financial data and analytics. the fiscal 2014 operating margin was 70 basis points lower than the prior year adjusted operating margin of 33.5% (as calculated by adding back the $18.3 million stock-based compensation charge) due to acquisitions of revere and matrix in fiscal 2014 which lowered our 2014 operating margin by 80 basis points, higher t&e and data costs, and incremental employee compensation within cost of services. these reductions were partially offset by a 7.3% increase in revenues, a reduction in computer-related expenses and lower sg&a employee compensation.
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
operating income declined 1.3% during fiscal 2013 as compared to 2012 due to higher performance-based stock option expense, salary increases year over year, and additional hiring within the sales, engineering and content collection teams partially offset by lower third party data costs from a slower growing user base and reduced callstreet third party collection fees. employee head count grew 9% during fiscal 2013 to a total of 6,258 employees at august 31, 2013. in addition, the acquisition of streetaccount in june 2012 negatively impacted fiscal 2013 operating margin by 30 basis points due to higher employee compensation costs and the amortization of acquired intangibles.

our operating segments are aligned with how we, including our chief operating decision maker, manage the business and the demographic markets in which we operate. our internal financial reporting structure is based on three reportable segments; u.s., europe and asia pacific, which we believe helps us better manage the business and view the markets we serve. sales, consulting, data collection and software engineering are the primary functional groups within each segment. each segment records compensation, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of furniture and fixtures, amortization of leasehold improvements, communication costs, professional fees, rent expense, travel, marketing, office and other direct expenses. expenditures associated with our data centers, third party data costs and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the u.s. segment and are not allocated to the other segments. the content collection centers located in india and the philippines benefit all of our segments and thus the expenses incurred at these locations are allocated to each segment based on a percentage of revenues.
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
operating income from our u.s. business increased 19.0% to $165.0 million during fiscal 2014 compared to $138.7 million a year ago. the increase in operating income is attributable to $37.8 million of incremental revenues, a decrease in computer depreciation and a fiscal 2013 pre-tax charge of $18.3 million related to vesting of performance-based stock options, which did not recur in fiscal 2014. of the total pre-tax stock-based compensation charge of $18.3 million, $18.1 million was recorded within the u.s. segment as it related to primarily u.s.-based businesses. operating income growth was partially offset by increases in employee compensation within cost of services, a rise in t&e expenses, incremental legal fees, and additional expenses from the revere acquisition. u.s. revenue growth was driven by an increase in the number of clients and users of factset, the continued use of our advanced applications such as pa and growth in sales of wealth management. excluding the acquired revere workforce, u.s. employee headcount increased 6.8% over the prior year leading to higher employee compensation costs during fiscal 2014. computer-related expenses decreased due to the transition to more efficient and cost-effective servers in our data centers in addition to the continued use of fully depreciated servers. additional expenses from the acquisition of revere lowered u.s. operating income by $1.0 million for fiscal 2014.
european operating income advanced 70 basis points during fiscal 2014 to $100.9 million due to revenue growth of 8.9% partially offset by increases in employee compensation and the impact of the matrix acquisition. additional expenses from the acquisition of matrix lowered european operating income by $2.1 million.
asia pacific operating income increased 18.8% to $36.3 million compared to $30.5 million a year ago. the increase in asia pacific operating income is from incremental revenues of $5.9 million partially offset by higher employee compensation. the asia pacific revenues growth of 9.4% during fiscal 2014 was primarily due to our ability to sell our global content, expansion into new markets within asia, selling additional services to existing clients, and new client and user growth.
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
operating income from our u.s. business decreased 7.5% during fiscal 2013 compared to 2012. the decline in operating income in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the pre-tax charge of $18.3 million related to the vesting of performance-based stock options, higher employee compensation within cost of services and an increase in costs from the june 2012 acquisition of streetaccount, partially offset by a 6.6% increase in u.s. revenues, lower third party data costs and a decline in intangible asset amortization expense. the u.s. revenue growth was driven by the continued use of our advanced applications such as pa, growth in the market metrics suite of products, incremental revenues from streetaccount, sales of our wealth management solution and growth in the number of clients of factset.
european operating income increased 5.0% to $100.2 million during fiscal 2013 compared to 2012. the increase in european operating income was due to an $11.4 million increase in revenues, lower employee variable compensation expense, a reduction in t&e spending and lower amortization expense as previously acquired intangible assets became fully amortized. european revenues advanced 5.8% in fiscal 2013 to $208.8 million due to the broader selection of global proprietary content and increases in user and client counts and clients licensing advanced applications.
asia pacific operating income increased 10.6% to $30.5 million during fiscal 2013 compared to 2012. the increase in asia pacific operating income was from $4.5 million of incremental revenues and lower operating expenses due to the impact of foreign currency. asia pacific revenue growth year of 7.8% was due to growth in the global content offering, the expansion of our real-time news and quotes, and new client and user growth.

* included in the fiscal 2013 provision for income taxes were income tax benefits of $7.2 million primarily from the reenactment of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit in january 2013 and the finalization of the fiscal 2012 tax return.
income taxes fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
the fiscal 2014 provision for income taxes was $91.9 million, up $19.6 million or 27.2% from $72.3 million a year ago. this increase was due to a 12.0% increase in pre-tax income and the expiration of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit on december 31, 2013, which limited our ability to realize income tax benefits from the r&d credit to only four out of twelve months during fiscal 2014. if the u.s. federal r&d tax credit had been re-enacted by august 31, 2014, the fiscal 2014 annual effective tax rate would have been 28.7%. for comparative purposes, excluding the $7.2 million of income tax benefits in 2013, the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 29.3%. the adjusted annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 of 28.7%, including a hypothetical full year of r&d benefits, is 60 basis points lower than the adjusted rate for 2013 due to incremental foreign income taxed at rates lower than the u.s., which lowered the rate by 40 basis points.
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
in fiscal 2013, our provision for income taxes was $72.3 million, down 15.9% from 2012 due to income tax benefits of $7.2 million primarily from the reenactment of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit in january 2013 and the finalization of the fiscal 2012 tax return. our effective tax rate is based on current enacted tax laws and as such, prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2013, it did not reflect the r&d tax credit in any months of 2012 as the r&d credit expired on december 31, 2011. the reenactment of the r&d tax credit was retroactive to january 1, 2012 and resulted in an actual effective tax rate of 26.7% for the full fiscal 2013 year.
net income and diluted earnings per share fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
net income increased 6.5% to $211.5 million and diluted earnings per share increased 10.6% to $4.92 during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. drivers for the increase include incremental revenues of $62.2 million or 7.3%, lower stock-based compensation as a result of the $12.9 million in after-tax charge recorded in fiscal 2013 and a 3.7% decrease in diluted shares outstanding from share repurchases in the last 12 months. the increases in net income and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014 were partially offset by a higher annual effective tax rate from the expiration of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit, incremental employee compensation within cost of services due to the hiring of 202 net new software engineers and 70 net new consultants, a rise in third party data costs from additional users and clients added during the last 12 months and higher employee t&e.
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
net income rose 5.2% to $198.6 million and diluted earnings per share increased 8.0% to $4.45 during fiscal 2013 compared to 2012. included in fiscal 2013 were income tax benefits of $0.16 per diluted share from the reenactment of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit and the finalization of the fiscal 2012 tax return partially offset by the after-tax charge of $12.9 million or $0.29 per diluted share related to the vesting of performance-based stock options. drivers of net income and diluted earnings per share growth in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 were higher levels of revenue, lower third party data costs, a decline in the amortization of intangible assets and a reduction in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding partially offset by higher compensation costs.

(2)   we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, which includes the cash cost for taxes and changes in working capital, less capital expenditures. the presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. we use free cash flow, a non-gaap measure, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluation and management of the business. management believes that this financial measure and the information we provide are useful to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same metric that we use to gauge progress in achieving our goals. free cash flow is also an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund further investments in future growth initiatives.
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
cash and cash equivalents aggregated to $116.4 million or 18% of our total assets at august 31, 2014, compared with $196.6 million or 28% of our total assets august 31, 2013. all of our operating and capital expense requirements were financed entirely from cash generated from our operations. our cash and cash equivalents decreased $80.2 million during fiscal 2014 due to $46.9 million in cash used to acquire revere and matrix, $279.8 million in share repurchases, dividend payments of $61.0 million, capital expenditures of $17.7 million, and purchases of investments, net of proceeds, of $6.1 million. these cash outflows are partially offset by cash provided by operations of $265.0 million, $52.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $12.0 million in tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements and $2.2 million from the effects of foreign currency.
free cash flow for fiscal 2014 was $247.3 million, exceeding net income by 17%. free cash flow generated during fiscal 2014 was attributable to $211.5 million of net income, $9.2 million of positive working capital changes and $44.3 million in non-cash expenses less $17.7 million in capital expenditures. working capital improvements were derived from lower income tax payments partially offset by a rise in accounts receivable compared to the prior year. employee stock option exercises, which reduced our tax payments, improved current year working capital. however, our days sales outstanding ("dso") as of august 31, 2014 rose to 34 days, up from a record low of 30 days a year ago primarily due to timing of large client payments in the prior year period.
net cash used in investing activities of $70.7 million, an increase of $50.3 million over fiscal 2013, is due to the acquisitions of revere and matrix for $46.9 million and a $4.8 million increase in cash utilized to purchase additional short-term certificates of deposit.
net cash used in financing activities was $276.7 million during fiscal 2014. of this total, $275.4 million related to the repurchase of 2.5 million shares under the existing share repurchase program and $61.0 million was for the payment of quarterly dividends. partially offsetting the use of cash were proceeds received from employee stock plans totaling $52.2 million and related tax benefits of $12.0 million. net cash used in financing activities was $38.3 million higher in the current year because of an $85.7 million reduction in proceeds from employee stock option exercises and an incremental $5.0 million in dividend repayments due to the 11% increase in our regular quarterly dividend. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases of $52.3 million. proceeds from employee stock exercises and its related income tax benefits were lower in the current year because the number of employee stock options exercised decreased by 1.5 million shares.
we expect that for at least the next 12 months, our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of our cash. furthermore, we expect existing domestic (u.s.) cash to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months. as of august 31, 2014, our total cash and cash equivalents worldwide was $116.4 million with no outstanding borrowings. approximately $11.9 million of our total available cash and cash equivalents is held in bank accounts located within the u.s., $79.2 million in europe (predominantly within the uk and france) and the remaining $25.3 million is held in asia pacific. we believe our liquidity (including cash on hand, cash from operating activities and other cash flows that we expect to generate) within each geographic segment will be sufficient to meet our short-term and longer-term operating requirements, as they occur, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend payments, stock repurchases and financing activities. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalent and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
31
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
our cash and cash equivalents increased $7.6 million during fiscal 2013 due to cash provided by operations of $269.8 million, $124.5 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25.2 million of tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements partially offset by $332.2 million in stock repurchases, dividend payments of $56.0 million, capital expenditures of $18.5 million, $1.2 million in purchases of investments (time deposits) and $3.4 million from the effect of exchange rate changes on foreign cash balances.
free cash flow generated in fiscal 2013 was $251.3 million, up 20% over fiscal 2012 and exceeded net income by 27%. free cash flow generated during fiscal 2013 was attributable to $198.6 million in net income, $17.5 million of positive working capital changes and $53.7 million in non-cash expenses less $18.5 in capital expenditures. working capital improvements of $17.5 million were derived from stronger accounts receivable collections as dso improved from 32 to 30 days, a reduction in tax payments due to stock option exercises and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses.
net cash used in investing activities was $20.4 million during fiscal 2013 due to capital expenditures of $18.5 million, $1.2 million in purchases of investments and the final working capital payment of $0.7 million related to the acquisition of streetaccount in june 2012. net cash used in investing activities was $38.4 million lower in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to the acquisition of streetaccount in june 2012, the purchase of $15 million in time deposits in fiscal 2012 and a $4.0 million decrease in capital expenditures.
net cash used in financing activities was $238.4 million in fiscal 2013 due to $332.2 million in share repurchases and $56.0 million in dividend payments partially offset by $149.8 million in proceeds from employee stock plans and related tax benefits. net cash used in financing activities was $79.7 million higher in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due to an increase in share repurchases of $178.5 million and $6.0 million more in dividends paid during fiscal 2013 partially offset by an incremental $104.9 million in proceeds from employee stock plans and incremental tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. in fiscal 2013, we repurchased 3.4 million shares under the existing share repurchase program for $327.3 million, while in fiscal 2012 we repurchased 1.6 million shares for $152.7 million. dividend payments increased by $6.0 million in fiscal 2013 due to a 13% increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with the company's dividend payment in june 2013. proceeds from employee stock exercises and related income tax benefits increased by $104.9 million in fiscal 2013 because the number of stock options exercised increased by 1.6 million.
capital resources capital expenditures capital expenditures were $17.7 million during fiscal 2014, down from $18.5 million a year ago. approximately $13.8 million or 78% of capital expenditures during fiscal 2014 related to the purchase of computer equipment including more servers for our existing data centers, purchasing laptop computers and peripherals for employees, upgrading existing computer systems in our data collection centers in india and the philippines and improving telecommunication equipment. the remaining 22% of capital expenditures was used primarily to build out our new san francisco office during fiscal 2014.
capital expenditures were $18.5 million during fiscal 2013, down from $22.5 million in fiscal 2012. approximately $12.2 million or 66% of capital expenditures during 2013 was for computer equipment and the remaining 34% was for additional furniture for existing space in boston and norwalk, the relocation and fit-out of our new hong kong office during october 2012 and office expansions, including new space in the philippines and the build out of our new office in san francisco.
capital needs we currently have no outstanding indebtedness, other than the letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business. approximately $1.8 million of standby letters of credit have been issued in connection with our current leased office space as of august 31, 2014. these standby letters of credit contain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios. as of august 31, 2014 and 2013, we maintained a zero debt balance and were in compliance with all covenants contained in the standby letters of credit.
foreign currency certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the u.s. dollar. the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses. translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders' equity.
32
our non-u.s. dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be $28 million while our non-u.s. dollar denominated expenses are $196 million, which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of $168 million. our foreign currency exchange exposure is related to our operating expense base in countries outside the u.s., where approximately 69% of our employees are located as of august 31, 2014. during fiscal 2014, foreign currency movements decreased operating income by $1.7 million as compared to a $0.6 million increase to operating income during fiscal 2013.
as of august 31, 2014, we maintained foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of our indian rupee exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, and approximately 50% of our philippines peso exposure through the second quarter of fiscal 2015. as of august 31, 2014, the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase indian rupees with u.s. dollars was rs.2.5 billion and $0.7 million, respectively. as of august 31, 2014, the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase philippine pesos with u.s. dollars was php288.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively. there were no other outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts at august 31, 2014. a loss on derivatives of $0.3 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2014, compared to a loss of $1.0 million during both fiscal 2013 and 2012.
off-balance sheet arrangements at august 31, 2014 and 2013, we had no off-balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships (such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities) established for purposes of facilitating off-balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually limited purposes.
share repurchase program during fiscal 2014, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $275.4 million under the existing share repurchase program as compared to 3.4 million shares for $327.3 million during fiscal 2013. on december 16, 2013, our board of directors approved a $300 million expansion of the existing share repurchase program. including the expansion, $87.0 million remains authorized for future share repurchases at august 31, 2014. repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions. no minimum number of shares to be repurchased has been fixed. there is no timeframe to complete the repurchase program and it is expected that share repurchases will be paid using existing and future cash generated by operations.
contractual obligations fluctuations in our operating results, the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts, the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here.
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31, 2014 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands):

(1)   operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. for more information on our operating leases, see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

(2)   purchase obligations represent payment due in future periods in respect of commitments to our various data vendors as well as commitments to purchase goods and services such as telecommunication and computer maintenance services.
(3)   non-current income taxes payable of $5.5 million and non-current deferred tax liabilities of $2.9 million have been excluded in the table above due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future payments.
purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future. for the purpose of this tabular disclosure, purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations. expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available. the amounts paid and timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed upon amounts for any of our obligations.

dividends on may 5, 2014, our board of directors approved an 11% increase in our regular quarterly dividend, beginning with the dividend payment in june 2014 of $0.39 per share, or $1.56 per share per annum. this is the ninth consecutive year that our annual dividend has been increased by more than 10%, resulting in a five year annual dividend growth rate of 14%. with our dividends and share repurchases, in the aggregate, we have returned $341 million to shareholders over the past 12 months.
during fiscal years 2014 and 2013, our board of directors declared the following dividends:

all of the above cash dividends were paid from existing cash resources. future cash dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by us and is subject to final determination by our board of directors.
significant accounting policies we describe our significant accounting policies in note 3, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below.
critical accounting estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. in addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.
accrued compensation we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation. approximately 15% of our total employee compensation is variable and discretionary. we conduct a final review of company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation. we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management's expectations. management takes these and other factors, including historical performance, into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate. the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation as of august 31, 2014 was $37.3 million compared $35.2 million as of august 31, 2013.
business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. all of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date. the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. our estimates are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate, includes assistance from independent third party appraisal firms. our significant assumptions and estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.
34
estimated tax provision and tax contingencies we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours. the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes. our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes, foreign operations, r&d and other tax credits, tax audit settlements, incentive-stock options and domestic production activities deductions. our annual effective tax rate was 30.3%, 26.7% and 31.3% in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
we recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date. otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. additionally, we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements.
as of august 31, 2014, we have gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling $5.5 million, including $1.1 million of accrued interest, recorded as non-current taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheet. unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. when applicable, we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled. if recognized, the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statement of income. audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. for this reason, we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them. significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement. further, as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
performance-based equity awards we have an employee stock-based compensation plan, which allows for the issuance of performance-based equity awards to employees. accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all performance-based equity awards made to employees based on the estimated fair values of the awards that are expected to vest. at the end of each reporting period, management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets because the number of stock options that vest will be predicated on us achieving these levels. however, there is no current guarantee that such options will vest in whole or in part.
november 2011 annual employee performance-based option grant review in november 2011, we granted 665,551 performance-based employee stock options. none of these performance-based stock options vested because we did not achieve certain performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31, 2013. these performance-based options were recorded as forfeitures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
november 2012 annual employee performance-based option grant review in november 2012, we granted 1,011,510 performance-based employee stock options. the number of performance-based options that vest is based on us achieving performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31, 2014. based upon the actual organic asv and diluted eps growth in the past two years, 20% or 185,014 (net of options previously forfeited) became eligible for vesting as of august 31, 2014, which results in unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 3.1 years. the remaining 80% of performance-based options previously outstanding were recorded as forfeitures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
35
july 2012 performance-based option grant review in july 2012, we granted 241,546 performance-based employee stock options, which are eligible to vest in 20% tranches depending upon future streetaccount user growth through august 31, 2017. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the first growth target was achieved, thus 20% or 48,314 options vested as of august 31, 2013. the second 20% tranche vested on august 31, 2014 as a result of accelerated expansion of streetaccount users. in addition, due to the accelerated 2014 growth and forecasted future usage growth, we estimated that the third 20% tranche will vest by august 31, 2017. this reflected a higher performance level than previously estimated and accordingly increased the number of options that will vest to a total of 60%. we were required to record a pre-tax stock-based compensation charge of $1.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. the change in estimate also resulted in unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $0.9 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 3.0 years. a change, up or down, in the actual financial performance levels achieved by streetaccount in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense (in thousands):
vesting            cumulative              remaining expense tranche       catch-up adjustment*          to be recognized

matrix and revere performance-based option grants in connection with the acquisitions of matrix and revere during fiscal 2014, factset granted 165,949 and 36,695 performance-based stock options, respectively. the options granted to key employees of matrix will vest only if asv and operating margin targets related to the matrix business are met during a five year measurement period ending december 23, 2018, and the option holders remain employed by factset. as of august 31, 2014, factset did not believe these targets are probable of being achieved, and as such, no stock-based compensation expense has been record or is expected to be realized in connection with these options. of the 36,695 performance-based stock options granted in connection with the revere acquisition, factset currently estimates that 18,553 options will vest based upon the achievement of certain asv and operating margins during the measurement period ending august 31, 2015. this results in unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 4years.
revere restricted stock units in connection with the acquisitions of revere, factset granted 7,744 performance-based restricted stock units. of the 7,744 performance-based restricted stock units granted, 3,872 are estimated to vest based upon our belief that certain asv and operating margin targets will be achieved during the measurement period ending august 31, 2017. as of august 31, 2014, unamortized stock-based compensation of $0.3 million will be amortized to compensation expense over the remaining vesting period of 4.0 years. the remaining 3,872 performance-based restricted stock units are expected to be forfeited.
long-lived assets long-lived assets, comprised of property, equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computer-related assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations. when evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset's carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value. if we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. using the impairment evaluation methodology described herein, there have been no long-lived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years. the carrying value of long-lived assets as of august 31, 2014, was $57.6 million.
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.

intangible assets intangible assets consist of certain acquired content databases, client relationships, software technology, non-compete agreements and trade names resulting from previous acquisitions and depending on the nature of the intangible asset, are amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging between two and twenty years. the remaining useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. there were no adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented. these intangible assets have no assigned residual values as of august 31, 2014 and 2013. intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. no impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented. the carrying value of intangible assets as of august 31, 2014 and 2013 was $41.9 million and $36.2 million, respectively. our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
valuation of goodwill in september 2011, the fasb issued an accounting standard update intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. the guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. an entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. this accounting standard update became effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, and its adoption has not had an impact on our consolidated financial statements because we have not elected to first assess qualitative factors, but have performed the quantitative analysis instead.
we evaluate goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and consider other publicly available market information. we determined that there were three reporting units during fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, which are consistent with our operating segments because there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment. our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment during fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 were u.s., europe and asia pacific, which reflects the level of internal reporting we use to manage our business and operations. we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 and given the significant headroom of fair value in excess of carrying value, we determined that there were no reporting units that were deemed at risk and there had been no impairment. the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31, 2014 and 2013 was $285.6 million and $244.6 million, respectively.
we determine fair value using the discounted cash flows model. this analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors including market conditions, legal and technological factors and the profitability of future business strategies. it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired, which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a write-down of the related asset.
new accounting pronouncements see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption, which we include here by reference.
market trends in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to financial risks involving foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. major equity indices continue to experience volatility. approximately 82.6% of our asv is derived from our investment management clients. the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management. an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes. moreover, extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation, resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers.

our investment banking clients that perform m&a advisory work, provide capital markets services and equity research, account for approximately 17.4% of our asv. a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large, bulge bracket banks. credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations. clients could encounter similar problems. a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt. additional uncertainty, consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth.
we service m&a departments, capital markets and equity research. these are low risk businesses that do not deploy leverage and will likely continue to operate far into the future and should represent a larger percentage of the overall revenues of our clients. regardless, the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities. our revenues may decline if banks including those involved in recent merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate m&a, capital markets and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments.

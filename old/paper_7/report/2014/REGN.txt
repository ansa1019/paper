item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
overview we are a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that discovers, invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions. we commercialize medicines for eye diseases, colorectal cancer, and a rare inflammatory condition and have product candidates in development in other areas of high unmet medical need, including hypercholesterolemia, oncology, ra, asthma, and atopic dermatitis.
our total revenues were $2,819.6 million in 2014, compared to $2,104.7 million in 2013 and $1,378.5 million in 2012. our net income was $348.1 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, in 2014, compared to $424.4 million, or $3.81 per diluted share, in 2013, and $750.3 million, or $6.75 per diluted share, in 2012. net income in 2012 included an income tax benefit of $335.8 million, primarily attributable to the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. refer to "results of operations" below for further details of our financial results.
we currently have three marketed products:
•   eylea (aflibercept) injection. we commenced sales of eylea for the treatment of wet amd in november 2011, for the treatment of macular edema following crvo in september 2012, and for the treatment of dme in july 2014, following receipt of regulatory approval in the united states. in addition, in october 2014, the fda approved eylea for the treatment of macular edema following rvo, which includes macular edema following brvo. bayer healthcare commenced sales of eylea for the treatment of wet amd in the fourth quarter of 2012 and for the treatment of macular edema secondary to crvo in the fourth quarter of 2013 following receipt of regulatory approvals outside the united states. in addition, bayer healthcare commenced sales of eylea for the treatment of visual impairment due to dme in the third quarter of 2014 following receipt of regulatory approval in the eu. in september 2014, the japanese mhlw approved eylea for mcnv. bayer healthcare has additional regulatory applications for eylea for the treatment of wet amd, macular edema secondary to crvo, and dme pending in other countries. in addition, bayer healthcare has submitted applications to the ema and mhlw seeking marketing authorization in the eu and japan, respectively, for eylea for the treatment of macular edema following brvo.
in september 2014, based on data from the vivid-dme and vista-dme trials, the fda granted eylea breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy in patients with dme. in november 2014, the fda accepted for priority review the sbla for eylea for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy in patients with dme, with a target action date of march 30, 2015.
we are collaborating with bayer healthcare on the global development and commercialization of eylea outside the united states. bayer healthcare markets, and records revenue from sales of, eylea outside the united states, where, for countries other than japan, the companies share equally the profits and losses from sales of eylea. in japan, we are entitled to receive a percentage of the sales of eylea. we maintain exclusive rights to eylea in the united states and are entitled to all profits from such sales.
net product sales of eylea in the united states were $1,736.4 million in 2014, $1,408.7 million in 2013, and $837.9 million in 2012. bayer healthcare records revenue from sales of eylea outside the united states. eylea net product sales outside of the united states were $1,038.5 million in 2014, $472.1 million in 2013, and $19.0 million in 2012.
•   zaltrap (ziv-aflibercept) injection for intravenous infusion. we and sanofi globally collaborate on the development and commercialization of zaltrap, and share profits and losses from commercialization of zaltrap, except for japan, where we are entitled to receive a percentage of the sales of zaltrap. zaltrap net product sales, which are recorded by sanofi, commenced in the united states in august 2012 and in europe in the first quarter of 2013, and were $91.4 million in 2014, $70.2 million in 2013, and $31.7 million in 2012. regulatory applications for marketing authorization of zaltrap for the treatment of previously treated mcrc patients in other countries have also been submitted and are currently under review by the respective regulatory agencies.
•   arcalyst (rilonacept) injection for subcutaneous use. arcalyst is available in the united states for the treatment of caps in adults and children 12 years and older. caps are a group of rare, inherited, auto-inflammatory conditions characterized by life-long, recurrent symptoms of rash, fever/chills, joint pain, eye redness/pain, and fatigue. intermittent, disruptive exacerbations or flares can be triggered at any time by exposure to cooling temperatures, stress, exercise, or
52
other unknown stimuli. net product sales of arcalyst were $14.4 million in 2014, $17.1 million in 2013, and $20.2 million in 2012.
developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense. before significant revenues from the commercialization of our antibody candidates or new indications for our marketed products can be realized, we (or our collaborators) must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda and regulatory authorities in other countries. in addition, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.
our ability to continue to generate profits and to generate positive cash flow from operations over the next several years depends significantly on our continued success in commercializing eylea. we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities, a significant portion of which we expect to be reimbursed by our collaborators. also, our research and development activities outside our collaborations, the costs of which are not reimbursed, will expand and require additional resources. our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on, among other factors, the net sales of our marketed products, the scope and progress of our research and development efforts, the timing of certain expenses, and the continuation of our collaborations with sanofi and bayer healthcare, including our share of collaboration profits or losses from sales of commercialized products and the amount of reimbursement of our research and development expenses that we receive from collaborators. we cannot predict whether or when new products or new indications for our marketed products will receive regulatory approval or, if any such approval is received, whether we will be able to successfully commercialize such product(s) and whether or when they may become profitable.
we have 17 product candidates in clinical development, all of which were discovered in our research laboratories. these consist of two trap-based clinical programs and 15 fully human monoclonal antibody product candidates, as summarized below. each of the antibodies in the table below was generated using our velocimmune technology.

•   it requires an assumption (or assumptions) regarding a future outcome; and
•   changes in the estimate or the use of different assumptions to prepare the estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. the critical accounting estimates that impact our consolidated financial statements are described below.
revenue recognition product revenue product sales consist of u.s. sales of eylea and arcalyst. revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss have passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured, we have no further performance obligations, and returns can be reasonably estimated. we record revenue from product sales upon delivery to our distributors and specialty pharmacies (collectively, our customers).
revenue from product sales is recorded net of applicable provisions for rebates and chargebacks under governmental programs, such as medicaid and veterans' administration (va), distribution-related fees, prompt pay discounts, and other sales-related deductions. we estimate reductions to product sales based upon contracts with customers and government agencies, statutorily-defined discounts applicable to government-funded programs, historical experience, estimated payer mix, inventory levels in the distribution channel, shelf life of the product, and other relevant factors. calculating these provisions involves estimates and

judgments. we review our estimates of rebates, chargebacks, and other applicable provisions each period and record any necessary adjustments in the current period's net product sales. the following table summarizes the provisions, and credits/payments, for sales-related deductions.

collaboration revenue we earn collaboration revenue in connection with collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms. these arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, services, and/or goods across the entire life cycle of a product or product candidate. the terms of these agreements typically include that consideration be provided to us in the form of non-refundable up-front licensing payments, research progress (milestone) payments, payments for development and commercialization activities, and sharing of profits or losses arising from the commercialization of products. in arrangements involving multiple deliverables, we must determine whether each deliverable qualifies as a separate unit of accounting, whether the deliverables have value to the collaborator on a standalone basis, and how the consideration should be allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive performance milestone, involving a degree of risk, are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due and non-refundable, provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone. in determining whether a payment is deemed to be a substantive performance milestone, we take into consideration (i) the enhancement in value to the related development product candidate, (ii) our performance and the relative level of effort required to achieve the milestone, (iii) whether the milestone relates solely to past performance, and (iv) whether the milestone payment is considered reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms. payments for achieving milestones which are not considered substantive are deferred and recognized over the related performance period.
in connection with non-refundable licensing payments, our performance period estimates are principally based on projections of the scope, progress, and results of our research and development activities. due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product, changes to development plans as programs progress, and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, revisions to performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically, and could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future. in addition, our estimated performance periods may change if development programs encounter delays, or we and our collaborators decide to expand or contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate in various disease indications.
when we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of the research and development expenses that we incur under a collaboration, we record those reimbursable amounts as collaboration revenue proportionately as we recognize our expenses. if the collaboration is a cost-sharing arrangement in which both we and our collaborator perform development work and share costs, we also recognize, as additional research and development expense in the period when our collaborator incurs development expenses, the portion of the collaborator's development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse.
under our collaboration agreements, product sales and cost of sales for products which are currently approved are recorded by our collaborators. we share in any profits or losses arising from the commercialization of such products. our collaborator provides us with our estimated share of the profits or losses from commercialization of such products for the most recent fiscal quarter. our collaborators' estimates of profits or losses for such quarter are reconciled to actual profits or losses in the subsequent fiscal quarter, and our share of the profit or loss is adjusted accordingly, as necessary.

clinical trial expenses clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third-party contractors. we outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities, utilizing external entities such as cros, independent clinical investigators, and other third-party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies. for each clinical trial that we conduct, certain clinical trial costs are expensed immediately, while others are expensed over time based on the expected total number of patients in the trial, the rate at which patients enter the trial, and/or the period over which clinical investigators or cros are expected to provide services.
clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other administrative functions to manage our clinical trials are performed primarily by cros. cros typically perform most of the start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, and program management. on a budgeted basis, these start-up costs are typically 10% to 20% of the total contract value. on an actual basis, this percentage range can be significantly wider, as many of our contracts with cros are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget, while start-up costs for the particular trial may not change materially. these start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are event driven in nature. the remaining activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. in the event of early termination of a clinical trial, we accrue and recognize expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non-cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial and/or penalties.
for clinical study sites, where payments are made periodically on a per-patient basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, we accrue expenses on an estimated cost-per-patient basis, based on subject enrollment and activity in each quarter. the amount of clinical study expense recognized in a quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and progress of the study, the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter, the required level of patient enrollment, the rate at which patients actually enroll in and drop-out of the clinical study, and the number of sites involved in the study. clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those that have a significant number of sites, require a large number of patients, have complex patient screening requirements, and span multiple years. during the course of a trial, we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. our estimates and assumptions for clinical expense recognition could differ significantly from our actual results, which could cause material increases or decreases in research and development expenses in future periods when the actual results become known.
stock-based compensation we recognize stock-based compensation expense for grants of stock option awards and restricted stock under our long-term incentive plans to employees and non-employee members of our board of directors based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. the grant-date fair value of an award is generally recognized as compensation expense over the award's requisite service period.
we use the black-scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option awards. using this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to (i) expected volatility of our common stock price, (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend yield on our common stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates, which are based on quoted u.s. treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options' expected lives. expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options' expected lives. expected lives are principally based on our historical exercise experience with previously issued employee and board of directors option grants. the expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. stock-based compensation expense also includes an estimate, which is made at the time of grant, of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. this estimate is revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of option awards reflect our best estimates but involve uncertainties related to market and other conditions, many of which are outside of our control. changes in any of these assumptions may materially affect the fair value of stock options granted and the amount of stock-based compensation recognized in future periods.
in addition, we have granted performance-based stock option awards which vest based upon the optionee satisfying certain performance and service conditions as defined in the agreements. potential compensation cost, measured on the grant date, related to these performance options will be recognized only if, and when, we estimate that these options will vest, which is based on whether we consider the options' performance conditions to be probable of attainment. our estimates of the number of performance-based options that will vest will be revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods. changes in these estimates may materially affect the amount of stock-based compensation that we recognize in future periods related to performance-based options. there were no performance-based options that were unvested as of december 31, 2014.
59
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts ("temporary differences") at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. we periodically re-assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on various factors including our historical earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, and forecasts of future operating results and utilization of net operating losses and tax credits prior to their expiration. significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent that a reversal of any portion of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is deemed appropriate, a tax benefit will be recognized against our income tax provision in the period of such reversal.
uncertain tax positions are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board (fasb) authoritative guidance, which prescribes a comprehensive model for the manner in which a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements all material uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. those positions, for which management's assessment is that there is more than a 50% probability of sustaining the position upon challenge by a taxing authority based upon its technical merits, are subjected to certain measurement criteria.
inventories we capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval when, based on management's judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized; otherwise, such costs are expensed as research and development. the determination to capitalize inventory costs is based on various factors, including status and expectations of the regulatory approval process, any known safety or efficacy concerns, potential labeling restrictions, and any other impediments to obtaining regulatory approval.
we periodically analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to expected sale or has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, and write-down such inventories as appropriate. in addition, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. if certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration, we record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down such unmarketable inventory to its estimated realizable value. in 2014, 2013, and 2012, cost of goods sold included inventory write-downs and reserves totaling $6.0 million, $9.1 million, and $17.0 million, respectively.

our share of the loss in 2014 and 2013 represents our share of the costs of launching and commercializing zaltrap, partly offset by net product sales.
in 2014, sanofi's reimbursement of our antibody research and development expenses consisted of $160.0 million under our discovery agreement and $387.8 million under our license agreement, compared to $160.0 million and $293.5 million, respectively, in 2013. under the amended discovery agreement, sanofi agreed to fund up to $160.0 million per year of our antibody discovery activities. the higher reimbursement of development costs in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased development activities for dupilumab, praluent and certain other, earlier-stage antibody product candidates.
reimbursement of regeneron commercialization-related expenses represents reimbursement of internal and external costs in connection with preparing to commercialize antibody product candidates. these revenues increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher commercialization activities related to praluent.
62
during 2014, we and sanofi began sharing pre-launch commercialization expenses related to praluent and sarilumab in accordance with the companies' antibody collaboration agreement. as a result, we began recording our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies.
in 2013, we acquired from sanofi full exclusive rights to two families of novel antibodies invented at regeneron and previously included in our antibody collaboration with sanofi. in connection with acquiring from sanofi full exclusive rights to (i) antibodies targeting the pdgf family of receptors and ligands in opthalmology and all other indications and (ii) antibodies targeting the ang2 receptor and ligand in ophthalmology, we made two $10.0 million up-front payments to sanofi.
other sanofi antibody revenue includes recognition of deferred revenue from an $85.0 million up-front payment and other payments. as of december 31, 2014, $54.0 million of the up-front and other payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods.

bayer healthcare records revenue from sales of eylea outside the united states. in 2014 and 2013, our share of the profit we earned from commercialization of eylea outside the united states was partly offset by our contractual obligation to reimburse bayer healthcare for a portion of the agreed-upon development expenses previously incurred by bayer healthcare.
in 2014, we earned, and recorded as revenue, six $15.0 million sales milestones from bayer healthcare upon total aggregate net sales of eylea outside the united states exceeding $500 million, $600 million, $700 million, $800 million, $900 million, and $1 billion, respectively, over a twelve-month period. additionally, in 2014, we earned a $15.0 million sales milestone from bayer healthcare upon total aggregate net sales of specific commercial supplies of eylea outside the united states exceeding $100 million over a twelve-month period. in 2013, we earned $15.0 million and $10.0 million substantive development milestones from bayer healthcare upon receipt of marketing and pricing approval, respectively, outside the united states for eylea for the treatment of macular edema secondary to crvo. in addition, we earned, and recorded as revenue in 2013, three $15.0 million sales milestones from bayer healthcare upon total aggregate net sales of eylea outside the united states exceeding $200 million, $300 million, and $400 million, respectively, over a twelve-month period.
cost-sharing of our global eylea development expenses with bayer healthcare increased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013. in january 2014, bayer healthcare decided to participate in the global development and commercialization of eylea outside the united states for the treatment of macular edema following brvo. in connection with this decision, bayer healthcare reimbursed us $15.7 million for a defined share of the eylea global development costs that we had incurred prior to february 2014 for the brvo indication, which was recognized as bayer healthcare collaboration revenue in the first quarter of 2014. in addition, all future agreed upon global eylea development expenses incurred in connection with brvo are being shared equally, and any future profits or losses on sales of eylea outside of the united states for the treatment of macular edema following brvo will also be shared. this 2014 increase was partly offset by the winding down of various eylea development activities.
other eylea revenue increased principally due to higher reimbursement of other regeneron eylea expenses, primarily related to bayer healthcare's share of royalties payable to genentech which commenced in may 2013 pursuant to the license and settlement agreement as described below under "liquidity and capital resources - license and settlement agreements with genentech - eylea", in connection with sales of eylea outside the united states. other eylea revenue also includes recognition of deferred revenue related to eylea up-front and 2007 non-substantive milestone payments from bayer healthcare. as of december 31, 2014, $13.8 million of the eylea up-front and 2007 milestone payments was deferred and will be recognized ratably as revenue in future periods.
cost-sharing of regn2176-3 development expenses with bayer healthcare commenced in the first quarter of 2014 following the execution of the companies' pdgfr-beta antibody collaboration agreement as described above under "liquidity and capital resources - collaborations with bayer healthcare - pdgfr-beta antibody outside the united states." other pdgfr-beta antibody revenue consists of recognition of deferred revenue related to the pdgfr-beta up-front payment and non-substantive milestones received in the first quarter of 2014. as of december 31, 2014, $19.9 million of the pdgfr-beta up-front and 2014 milestone payments was deferred and will be recognized ratably as revenue in future periods.
technology licensing and other revenue in connection with the amendment and extension of our velocimmune license agreement with astellas, in august 2010, we received a $165.0 million up-front payment, which was deferred upon receipt and is being recognized as revenue ratably over a seven-year period beginning in june 2011. in both 2014 and 2013, we recognized $23.6 million of technology licensing and other revenue related to this agreement. as of december 31, 2014, $81.0 million of the august 2010 technology licensing payment received from astellas was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods.
under a june 2009 agreement with novartis, we receive royalties on worldwide sales of novartis' ilaris (canakinumab). in 2014 and 2013, technology licensing and other revenue included $7.9 million and $4.8 million, respectively, of royalties from novartis.
expenses total operating expenses increased to $1,981.1 million in 2014 from $1,344.7 million in 2013. our average headcount in 2014 increased to 2,629 from 2,153 in 2013, principally in connection with expanding our research and development, and commercialization activities.
operating expenses in 2014 and 2013 included a total of $307.2 million and $198.4 million, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense related to employee stock option and restricted stock awards (non-cash compensation expense). the increase in total non-cash compensation expense in 2014 was primarily attributable to the higher fair market value of our common stock on the date of our annual employee option grants made in december 2013 compared to recent prior years. as of december 31, 2014, unrecognized non-cash compensation expense related to outstanding stock options was $706.0 million and unvested
64
restricted stock awards was $34.5 million. we expect to recognize this non-cash compensation expense over weighted-average periods of 1.9 years and 2.8 years, respectively.
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to $1,271.4 million in 2014 from $859.9 million in 2013. the following table summarizes the major categories of our research and development expenses in 2014 and 2013:
research and development expenses*                                                           year ended december 31,              increase

* certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.
(1) includes non-cash compensation expense of $157.1 million in 2014 and $101.9 million in 2013.
(2) represents the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, as well as pre-launch commercial supplies which were not capitalized as inventory. includes related payroll and benefits, non-cash compensation expense, manufacturing materials and supplies, drug filling, packaging, and labeling costs, depreciation, and occupancy costs of our rensselaer, new york manufacturing facility. also includes non-cash compensation expense of $27.2 million in 2014 and $14.6 million in 2013.
(3) under our collaborations with bayer healthcare and sanofi, in periods when bayer healthcare or sanofi incurs certain development expenses, we also recognize, as additional research and development expense, the portion of our collaborators' development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. our collaborators provide us with estimated development expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter. bayer healthcare and sanofi's estimates are reconciled to their actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter, and our portion of our collaborators' development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted accordingly.
payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount and non-cash compensation expense, as described above. clinical trial expenses increased due primarily to additional costs for clinical studies of dupilumab and regn1033, partly offset by lower eylea-related costs. clinical manufacturing costs increased primarily due to additional costs related to manufacturing drug supplies of praluent. research and other development costs increased primarily due to our 50% share ($33.8 million) of the cost of purchasing an fda priority review voucher in 2014, as described above under item 1. "business - late-stage antibody-based clinical programs - praluent (pcsk9 antibody) for ldl cholesterol reduction" and two $5.0 million development milestone payments we made to sanofi in 2014 in connection with our acquisition from sanofi of full exclusive rights to antibodies targeting the pdgf family of receptors in may 2013. occupancy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our higher headcount, expanded research and development activities, and higher information technology and facility-related costs at our tarrytown and rensselaer, new york sites. cost-sharing of bayer healthcare and sanofi development expenses increased primarily due to our obligation to fund 20% of sanofi's phase 3 praluent and sarilumab development costs, which commenced during the fourth quarter of 2013.

we prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in clinical development, which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor, non-cash compensation expense, and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects, and, under our collaborations with bayer healthcare and sanofi, the portion of bayer healthcare and sanofi's development expenses which they incur and we are obligated to reimburse. our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below:
project costs                                                             year ended december 31,              increase

drug development and approval in the united states is a multi-step process regulated by the fda. the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation, leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda which, if successful, allows the opportunity for study in humans, or clinical study, of the potential new drug. clinical development typically involves three phases of study: phases 1, 2, and 3. the most significant costs in clinical development are in phase 3 clinical trials, as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug development process. following successful completion of phase 3 clinical trials for a biological product, a bla must be submitted to, and accepted by, the fda and the fda must approve the bla prior to commercialization of the drug. it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of a bla, which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses. we may elect either on our own, or at the request of the fda, to conduct further studies that are referred to as phase 3b and 4 studies. phase 3b studies are initiated and either completed or substantially completed while the bla is under fda review. these studies are conducted under an ind. phase 4 studies, also referred to as post-marketing studies, are studies that are initiated and conducted after the fda has approved a product for marketing. in addition, as discovery research, preclinical development, and clinical programs progress, opportunities to expand development of drug candidates into new disease indications can emerge. we may elect to add such new disease indications to our development efforts (with the approval of our collaborator for joint development programs), thereby extending the period in which we will be developing a product.
there are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development, including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development, uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate, and other risks and uncertainties described in part i, item 1a, "risk factors." the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals, and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. any failure by us to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business.
for these reasons and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, the estimated cost and scope of the projects, and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available. similarly, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates in clinical development will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows.

selling, general, and administrative expenses selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $504.8 million in 2014 from $329.4 million in 2013 primarily due to higher costs associated with the branded prescription drug fee, higher non-cash compensation expense principally for the reason described under "expenses" above, higher headcount and headcount-related costs, and higher legal costs primarily in connection with patent enforcement. the increase in the branded prescription drug fee was primarily related to a $40.6 million incremental charge which was recorded in the third quarter of 2014. under the provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act (ppaca) and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010, a non-tax deductible annual fee (the branded prescription drug fee) is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. the legislation imposed an annual fee on companies for each calendar year beginning in 2011. this fee is allocated to companies based on their prior year market share of total branded prescription drug sales into these government programs. in july 2014, the internal revenue service (irs) issued final regulations that provide guidance on the branded prescription drug fee. the final regulations differ in some respects from the temporary regulations issued by the irs in 2011, including that a company is liable for the fee based on its branded prescription drug sales in the current year, instead of the liability only being applicable upon the first qualifying branded prescription drug sale of the following fee year under the temporary regulations. as a result of the issuance of these final irs regulations, we will record an estimate of the fee in the same period in which its qualifying branded prescription drug sales occur. therefore, in the third quarter of 2014, an incremental charge was recorded to (i) recognize a liability for the estimated fee payable based on 2014 sales through the first nine months of 2014, and (ii) expense the remaining prepaid asset recorded under the previous accounting for the estimated fee payable based on 2013 sales.
selling, general, and administrative expenses included $120.2 million and $80.0 million of non-cash compensation expense in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was $129.0 million in 2014 and $118.0 million in 2013. cost of goods sold, which primarily consists of royalties, as well as costs in connection with producing eylea and arcalyst commercial supplies, increased principally due to the increase in u.s. eylea net sales. in addition, in 2014 and 2013, cost of goods sold included inventory write-downs and reserves totaling $6.0 million and $9.1 million, respectively.
cost of collaboration manufacturing we manufacture commercial supplies of product for our collaborators. cost of collaboration manufacturing increased to $76.0 million in 2014 from $37.3 million in 2013 primarily due to royalties payable to genentech, which commenced in may 2013 pursuant to the license and settlement agreement as described below under "liquidity and capital resources - license and settlement agreements with genentech - eylea", in connection with sales of eylea outside the united states. cost of collaboration manufacturing also includes costs in connection with producing commercial supplies for our collaborators.
other income and expense total other expenses (net of other income) increased to $62.7 million in 2014 from $46.7 million in 2013. in 2014, we had investment and other income of $8.2 million, compared to investment and other expense of $0.2 million in 2013. in 2013, we recorded a $2.9 million other-than-temporary impairment of an equity security based upon the length of time that the security was in an unrealized loss position and our expectation that we will not hold the security until a potential recovery in value occurs. this impairment charge exceeded investment income earned in 2013 on our marketable securities.
interest expense in 2014 and 2013 includes interest associated with our 1.875% convertible senior notes, including amortization of the note discount and debt issuance costs, and interest associated with our facility lease obligations. interest expense in 2014 decreased compared to 2013 primarily due to $230.6 million principal amount of our convertible senior notes which were surrendered for conversion during 2014. in addition, in 2014, we recognized a $33.5 million loss in connection with these conversions.
income taxes in 2014, we recorded income tax expense of $427.7 million, based on an effective tax rate of 55.1%. the 2014 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate and the non-tax deductible branded prescription drug fee (as described above). in addition, new york state tax legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2014 reduced the new york state income tax rate to zero percent for "qualified manufacturers", including regeneron, effective in 2014; however, it also resulted in the reduction of our related deferred tax assets as a discrete item in the first quarter of 2014. as a result, this tax legislation caused a net increase in our effective tax rate by less than 1.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014
67
in 2013, we recorded income tax expense of $289.0 million, based on an effective tax rate of 40.5%. the 2013 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by increases related to state and local taxes, the non-deductible branded prescription drug fee, and losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with rates lower than the federal statutory rate. these increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by federal and state income tax credits. in january 2013, the american taxpayer relief act was enacted, which included a provision to extend the income tax credit for increased research activities retroactively to the tax year ended december 31, 2012, as well as for 2013. as a result of the extension, during 2013, we recognized the benefit of both the 2012 and 2013 federal research tax credit.
we expect our effective tax rate to continue to be negatively impacted by a shift in our geographic mix of profits and losses as we continue our international expansion in 2015. in addition, the federal income tax credit for increased research activities expired on december 31, 2014; as a result, unless tax legislation is enacted to extend or make permanent this federal income tax credit, we expect it will have a negative impact on our effective tax rate.

our share of the loss in 2013 and 2012 represents our share of the costs of launching and commercializing zaltrap, partly offset by net product sales.
in 2012, we earned a $50.0 million substantive milestone from sanofi upon fda approval of zaltrap. sanofi's reimbursement of our zaltrap research and development expenses decreased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to a decrease in research and development activities and lower costs related to manufacturing zaltrap prior to regulatory approval. other zaltrap revenue primarily consisted of recognition of deferred revenue related to the zaltrap up-front payments from sanofi and reimbursement of other zaltrap-related expenses. the decrease in other revenue resulted primarily from lower recognition of deferred revenue in 2013, due to lengthening the estimated performance period over which this deferred revenue is being recognized, effective in the first quarter of 2013.
in 2013, sanofi's reimbursement of our antibody research and development expenses consisted of $160.0 million under our discovery agreement and $293.5 million under our license agreement, compared to $181.9 million and $183.4 million, respectively, in 2012. under the amended discovery agreement, sanofi agreed to fund up to $160 million per year of our antibody discovery activities. in 2010, as we scaled up our capacity to conduct antibody discovery activities, sanofi funded only $137.7 million of our preclinical research under the expanded collaboration and the balance between that amount and $160.0 million was added to the funding otherwise available to us in 2011-2012. as a result, sanofi funded more of our discovery activities in 2012 than in
69
2013. the higher reimbursement of development costs in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to increased development activities for praluent and dupilumab.
as described above, in may 2013, we made two $10.0 million up-front payments to sanofi in connection with acquiring from sanofi full exclusive rights to antibodies targeting the pdgf family of receptors and ligands in ophthalmology and all other indications and to antibodies targeting the ang2 receptor and ligand in ophthalmology.
other antibody revenue relates primarily to recognition of deferred revenue from an $85.0 million up-front payment and other payments.
bayer healthcare collaboration revenue the collaboration revenue we earned from bayer healthcare, as detailed below, consisted of our share of profits in connection with commercialization of eylea outside the united states, recognition of sales and substantive development milestones, cost-sharing of regeneron eylea development expenses, reimbursement of other regeneron eylea expenses, and revenue related to a non-refundable $75.0 million up-front payment received in 2006 and a $20.0 million milestone payment received in 2007 (which, for the purpose of revenue recognition, was not considered substantive).

bayer healthcare records revenue from sales of eylea outside the united states. in 2013 and 2012, our share of the profit we earned from commercialization of eylea outside the united states was offset by our contractual obligation to reimburse bayer healthcare for a portion of the agreed-upon development expenses previously incurred by bayer healthcare.
in 2013, we earned $15.0 million and $10.0 million substantive development milestones from bayer healthcare upon receipt of marketing and pricing approval, respectively, outside the united states for eylea for the treatment of macular edema secondary to crvo. in addition, we earned, and recorded as revenue in 2013, three $15.0 million sales milestones from bayer healthcare upon total aggregate net sales of eylea outside the united states exceeding $200 million, $300 million, and $400 million, respectively, over a twelve-month period. in 2012, we earned $15.0 million and $10.0 million substantive milestones from bayer healthcare upon receipt of marketing and pricing approval, respectively, in japan for eylea for the treatment of wet amd.
70
cost-sharing of our global eylea development expenses with bayer healthcare decreased in 2013 compared to 2012, as we incurred lower costs in connection with winding down various phase 3 eylea clinical studies.
other revenue principally consists of (i) reimbursement of other regeneron eylea expenses, primarily related to bayer healthcare's share of royalties payable to genentech in connection with sales of eylea outside the united states, which commenced in may 2013, and (ii) recognition of deferred revenue related to the up-front and 2007 milestone payments from bayer healthcare. as described further below under "license and settlement agreements with genentech", in may 2013, we entered into an amended and restated non-exclusive license and settlement agreement with genentech to include all sales of eylea worldwide in our royalty obligation.
technology licensing and other revenue in connection with the amendment and extension of our velocimmune license agreement with astellas, in august 2010, we received a $165.0 million up-front payment, which was deferred upon receipt and is being recognized as revenue ratably over a seven-year period beginning in june 2011. in both 2013 and 2012, we recognized $23.6 million of technology licensing and other revenue related to this agreement.
under a june 2009 agreement with novartis, we receive royalties on worldwide sales of novartis' ilaris. in 2013 and 2012, technology licensing and other revenue included $4.8 million and $2.8 million, respectively, of royalties from novartis.
expenses total operating expenses increased to $1,344.7 million in 2013 from $920.8 million in 2012. our average headcount in 2013 increased to 2,153 from 1,827 in 2012, principally in connection with expanding our research and development, and commercialization activities.
operating expenses in 2013 and 2012 included a total of $198.4 million and $94.2 million, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense. the increase in total non-cash compensation expense in 2013 was primarily attributable to the higher fair market value of our common stock on the date of our annual employee option grants made in december 2012 compared to recent prior years.

* certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.
(1) includes non-cash compensation expense of $101.9 million in 2013 and $48.4 million in 2012.
(2) represents the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, including related payroll and benefits, non-cash compensation expense, manufacturing materials and supplies, drug filling, packaging, and labeling costs, depreciation, and occupancy costs of our rensselaer, new york manufacturing facility. includes non-cash compensation expense of $14.6 million and $5.4 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
(3) under our collaborations with bayer healthcare and sanofi, in periods when bayer healthcare or sanofi incur certain development expenses, we also recognize, as additional research and development expense, the portion of our collaborators' development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. our collaborators provide us with estimated development expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter. bayer healthcare and sanofi's estimates are reconciled to their actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter and our portion of our collaborators' development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted accordingly.
payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount and non-cash compensation expense, as described above. clinical trial expenses increased due primarily to higher costs for clinical studies of praluent, dupilumab, and early stage antibody product candidates, partly offset by lower costs related to our phase 3 trials of eylea in wet amd and macular edema following crvo, and arcalyst, which have concluded. clinical manufacturing costs increased primarily due to higher costs related to manufacturing praluent, sarilumab, and dupilumab, partly offset by lower costs related to manufacturing clinical supplies of arcalyst. research and other development costs increased primarily due to higher costs associated with our early stage research and development programs and regulatory submissions for marketing approvals for eylea. occupancy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our higher headcount, expanded research and development activities, and higher information technology and facility-related costs at our tarrytown and rensselaer, new york sites. cost-sharing of bayer healthcare and sanofi development expenses increased primarily due to our obligation to fund 20% of sanofi's phase 3 praluent and sarilumab development costs, which commenced during the fourth quarter of 2013.

selling, general, and administrative expenses selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $329.4 million in 2013 from $210.8 million in 2012 primarily due to higher expenses in connection with commercialization of eylea, including the branded prescription drug fee and contributions to a not-for-profit organization that assists patients with chronic disease conditions, and higher non-cash compensation expense principally for the reason described under "expenses" above. selling, general, and administrative expenses included $80.0 million and $39.2 million of non-cash compensation expense in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased to $118.0 million in 2013 from $83.9 million in 2012 due primarily to increased sales of eylea. cost of goods sold primarily consisted of royalties, as well as costs in connection with producing eylea and arcalyst commercial supplies. in addition, in 2013 and 2012, cost of goods sold included inventory write-downs and reserves totaling $9.1 million and $17.0 million, respectively.
cost of collaboration manufacturing we manufacture commercial supplies of product for our collaborators. cost of collaboration manufacturing increased to $37.3 million in 2013 from $0.5 million in 2012 primarily due to the launch of eylea outside the united states in the fourth quarter of 2012. cost of collaboration manufacturing primarily consists of third-party royalties, as well as costs in connection with producing commercial supplies for our collaborators.
other income and expense total other expenses (net of other income) increased to $46.7 million in 2013 from $43.3 million in 2012. other expenses consist of investment (expense) income and interest expense.
in 2013, we had investment and other expense of $0.2 million, compared to investment and other income of $2.0 million in 2012. in the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded a $2.9 million other-than-temporary impairment of an equity security based upon the length of time that the security was in an unrealized loss position and our expectation that we will not hold the security until a potential recovery in value occurs. this impairment charge exceeded investment income earned in 2013 on our marketable securities.
interest expense in 2013 and 2012 primarily included interest associated with our $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes, including amortization of the note discount and debt issuance costs, and interest associated with our facility lease obligations.

income taxes in 2013, we recorded income tax expense of $289.0 million, based on an effective tax rate of 40.5%. the difference between the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% and our effective tax rate for 2013 is primarily due to increases related to state and local taxes, the non-deductible branded prescription drug fee, and losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with rates lower than the federal statutory rate. these increases were partially offset by federal and state income tax credits. in january 2013, the american taxpayer relief act was enacted, which included a provision to extend the income tax credit for increased research activities retroactively to the tax year ended december 31, 2012, as well as for 2013. as a result of the extension, during 2013, we recognized the benefit of both the 2012 and 2013 federal research tax credit.
in the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded a $335.8 million income tax benefit, primarily attributable to the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. the decision to release this valuation allowance was made after we determined that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized, and was based on the evaluation and weighting of positive and negative evidence, including our achievement of a cumulative three-year income position in the fourth quarter of 2012. in addition, we considered forecasts of future operating results and utilization of net operating losses and tax credits prior to their expiration. therefore, starting in 2013, we recorded income tax expense on income using an estimated effective tax rate.
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012
as of december 31, 2014, we had $1,360.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared with $1,083.9 million as of december 31, 2013 and $587.5 million as of december 31, 2012. as described above, in 2014 we earned a total of $105.0 million in sales milestones from bayer healthcare (of which $30.0 million was receivable as of the end of the year). in 2013, we earned and received a total of $70.0 million in milestone payments from bayer healthcare. in 2012, we earned and received a $50.0 million milestone payment from sanofi, and $25.0 million of milestone payments from bayer healthcare.
cash provided by (used in) operating activities
2014. net cash provided by operating activities was $743.2 million in 2014. our net income of $348.1 million in 2014 included the following non-cash expenses: (i) non-cash compensation expense of $307.2 million, (ii) depreciation and amortization of $52.7 million, and (iii) a $33.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the conversion of our convertible senior notes during 2014. in addition, deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2014 increased by $66.6 million, compared to end-of-year 2013, primarily due to an increase in non-cash compensation expense partly offset by the reduction of our deferred tax assets related to the recently enacted new york state tax legislation, which reduced our new york state income tax rate to zero percent effective in 2014.
as of december 31, 2014, sanofi, bayer healthcare, and trade accounts receivable increased by $62.4 million, compared to end-of-year 2013, primarily due to higher amounts receivable from bayer healthcare in connection with the commercialization of eylea outside the united states, partly offset by lower trade accounts receivable resulting from shortened payment terms to certain of our u.s. eylea customers effective january 2014. inventories increased by $60.9 million, compared to end-of-year 2013, primarily in connection with increased production of eylea commercial supplies. our deferred revenue as of december 31, 2014 increased by $19.1 million, compared to end-of-year 2013, primarily due to (i) the receipt of a $25.5 million upfront payment as well as two $2.5 million non-substantive development milestone payments in 2014 in connection with our pdgfr-beta antibody collaboration agreement with bayer healthcare, and (ii) higher deferred revenue in connection with manufacturing commercial supplies of eylea for bayer healthcare, which is deferred until the product is sold by bayer healthcare to third-party customers. these increases were partly offset by amortization of a previously received and deferred $165.0 million payment under our license agreement with astellas and amortization of previously deferred payments under our sanofi and bayer healthcare collaborations. accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities increased by $162.2 million as of december 31, 2014, compared to end-of-year 2013, primarily due to (i) higher accruals for sales-related charges (including the impact of the branded prescription drug fee incremental charge as described above), deductions, and royalties related to eylea, (ii) higher payroll-related liabilities primarily driven by an increase in headcount, and (iii) higher expenditures in connection with our expanding research and development activities.
2013. net cash provided by operating activities was $583.6 million in 2013. our net income of $424.4 million in 2013 included non-cash compensation expense of $198.4 million and depreciation and amortization of $41.2 million. in addition, deferred tax assets at december 31, 2013 decreased by $63.6 million, compared to end-of-year 2012, primarily due to utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards to offset income taxes payable during 2013.
74
as of december 31, 2013, sanofi, bayer healthcare, and trade accounts receivable increased by $259.0 million, compared to end-of-year 2012, primarily due to higher trade accounts receivable in connection with eylea product sales and a higher receivable balance due from bayer healthcare in connection with the commercialization of eylea outside the united states. inventories increased by $48.0 million, compared to end-of-year 2012, primarily in connection with increased production of eylea commercial supplies. our deferred revenue as of december 31, 2013 decreased by $28.0 million, compared to end-of-year 2012, primarily due to amortization of a previously received and deferred $165.0 million payment under our license agreement with astellas and amortization of previously deferred payments under our sanofi and bayer healthcare collaborations, partly offset by costs of product manufactured for sanofi and bayer healthcare for which recognition of revenue has been deferred. accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities increased by $136.7 million as of december 31, 2013, compared to end-of-year 2012, primarily due to (i) higher sales-related charges, deductions, and royalties related to eylea, (ii) higher payroll-related liabilities, due in part to funding payment of our year-end 2012 employee cash bonuses in 2012, whereas year-end 2013 employee cash bonuses were accrued in 2013 and paid in 2014, and (iii) higher expenditures in connection with our expanding commercial and research and development activities.
2012. net cash used in operating activities was $74.6 million in 2012. our net income of $750.3 million in 2012 included (i) a non-cash tax benefit of $340.2 million resulting from the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, as previously described above, (ii) non-cash compensation expense of $94.2 million, (iii) depreciation and amortization of $36.9 million, (iv) non-cash interest expense of $22.9 million, including $21.6 million resulting from the amortization of the discount and debt issuance costs in connection with our convertible senior notes, which were issued in october 2011, and (v) other non-cash charges of $34.0 million, including inventory write-downs and reserves of $17.0 million.
as of december 31, 2012, sanofi, bayer healthcare and trade accounts receivable increased by $588.4 million, compared to end-of-year 2011, primarily due to higher trade accounts receivable in connection with eylea product sales. inventories increased by $28.9 million, compared to end-of-year 2011, primarily in connection with production of eylea commercial supplies. prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by $25.4 million, compared to end-of-year 2011, primarily due to an increase in prepaid royalties resulting from a $60.0 million lump-sum payment we made in the third quarter of 2012 under our non-exclusive license and partial settlement agreement with genentech, when cumulative u.s. sales of eylea reached $400.0 million. our deferred revenue as of december 31, 2012 decreased by $41.1 million, compared to end-of-year 2011, primarily due to amortization of a previously received and deferred $165.0 million payment under our license agreement with astellas and amortization of previously deferred payments under our sanofi and bayer healthcare collaborations.
cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $420.8 million, $355.5 million, and $81.1 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. in 2014, 2013, and 2012, purchases of marketable securities exceeded sales or maturities by $87.8 million, $199.1 million, and $31.7 million, respectively. capital expenditures of $333.0 million, $156.3 million, and $49.3 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, included costs in connection with expanding our rensselaer, new york manufacturing facilities and tenant improvement and associated costs related to our leased facilities in tarrytown, new york. in addition, capital expenditures in 2014 included costs in connection with the acquisition and renovations of our limerick, ireland manufacturing facility.
cash (used in) provided by financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $209.3 million and $97.6 million in 2014 and 2012, respectively, and net cash provided by financing activities was $77.1 million in 2013. in 2014, $230.6 million principal amount of our 1.875% convertible senior notes was surrendered for conversion, of which $220.6 million was settled prior to december 31, 2014. in accordance with the terms of the notes, we elected to settle these conversion obligations through a combination of cash, in an amount equal to the principal amount of the converted notes, and shares of our common stock in respect of any amounts due in excess thereof. also during 2014, we entered into agreements to reduce the number of warrants held by the warrant holders. pursuant to the agreements, we paid an aggregate amount of $294.6 million to the warrant holders to reduce the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. proceeds from issuances of common stock, in connection with exercises of employee stock options, were $126.0 million in 2014 compared to $57.4 million in 2013 and $63.5 million in 2012. in addition, payments for employee tax obligations in connection with stock option exercises were $267.6 million in 2014 compared to $195.1 million in 2013 and $163.3 million in 2012. cash flows from financing activities also increased by $448.6 million and $216.9 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, due to utilization of excess tax benefits in connection with stock option exercises, which offset cash tax obligations.

collaborations with sanofi zaltrap (aflibercept)
as described above under item 1. "business - collaboration agreements - collaboration with sanofi," since september 2003, we and sanofi have been parties to a global collaboration for the development and commercialization of zaltrap. under the collaboration agreement, as amended, we and sanofi share co-promotion rights and profits and losses on sales of zaltrap outside of japan for disease indications included in our collaboration. in japan, we are entitled to receive a percentage of approximately 35% on annual sales of zaltrap, subject to certain potential adjustments.
under the collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed-upon worldwide zaltrap development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement, including costs associated with the manufacture of clinical drug supplies, are funded by sanofi. we are obligated to reimburse sanofi out of our share of zaltrap profits, if any, for 50% of the development expenses that it funded, as well as 50% of the $25.0 million payment received in connection with the january 2005 amendment to our collaboration agreement, in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits, or at a faster rate at our option. as a result, we expect that, initially, our share of any zaltrap profits (including our percentage of sales of zaltrap in japan) will be used to reimburse sanofi for this repayment obligation. in particular, our contingent reimbursement obligation to sanofi for zaltrap was approximately $461 million as of december 31, 2014.
refer to "results of operations" above for sanofi collaboration revenue recognized in connection with our zaltrap collaboration.
sanofi has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least twelve months advance notice. upon termination of the agreement for any reason, any remaining obligation to reimburse sanofi for 50% of zaltrap development expenses will terminate and we will retain all rights to zaltrap.
antibodies as described above under item 1. "business - collaboration agreements - collaboration with sanofi," since november 2007, we and sanofi have been parties to a global, strategic collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies. under the amended discovery agreement, sanofi agreed to fund up to $160 million per year of our antibody discovery activities in 2010 through 2017. sanofi has an option to extend certain antibody development and preclinical activities relating to selected program targets for up to an additional three years after 2017. for each drug candidate identified through discovery research under the discovery agreement, sanofi has the option to license rights to the candidate under the license agreement. if it elects to do so, sanofi will co-develop the drug candidate with us through product approval. under certain defined circumstances, upon exercising its option to license rights to particular candidates, sanofi must make a $10 million substantive milestone payment to us.
under the license agreement, agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement are funded by sanofi, except that following receipt of the first positive phase 3 trial results for a co-developed drug candidate, subsequent phase 3 trial-related costs for that drug candidate (called shared phase 3 trial costs) are shared 80% by sanofi and 20% by us. consequently, commencing in 2013, we recognized as additional research and development expense $109.7 million and $17.6 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, of antibody development expenses that we were obligated to reimburse to sanofi related to praluent and sarilumab. if the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi for 50% of worldwide development expenses that were fully funded by sanofi and 30% of shared phase 3 trial costs, in accordance with a defined formula based on the amounts of these expenses and our share of the collaboration profits from commercialization of collaboration products. however, we are not required to apply more than 10% of our share of the profits from collaboration products in any calendar quarter towards reimbursing sanofi for these development costs. in particular, our contingent reimbursement obligation to sanofi in connection with the companies' antibody collaboration was approximately $1,304 million as of december 31, 2014. if sanofi does not exercise its option to license rights to a particular drug candidate under the license agreement, we retain the exclusive right to develop and commercialize such drug candidate, and sanofi will receive a royalty on sales, if any.
sanofi will lead commercialization activities for products developed under the license agreement, subject to our right to co-promote such products. to date, we have exercised our right to co-promote praluent in the united states. the parties will equally share profits and losses from sales within the united states. the parties will share profits outside the united states on a sliding scale based on sales starting at 65% (sanofi)/35% (us) and ending at 55% (sanofi)/45% (us), and losses outside the united states at 55% (sanofi)/45% (us). effective in the second and fourth quarters of 2014, we and sanofi began sharing pre-launch commercialization expenses related to praluent and sarilumab, respectively, which resulted in us recording our share of the loss in connection with commercialization of antibodies of $41.4 million in 2014. in addition to profit sharing, we are entitled to
76
receive up to $250 million in sales milestone payments, with milestone payments commencing only if and after aggregate annual sales outside the united states exceed $1.0 billion on a rolling 12-month basis.
we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical requirements of each drug candidate under the collaboration until commercial supplies of that drug candidate are being manufactured. in connection with the november 2009 amendment of the collaboration's discovery agreement, sanofi funded $30 million of agreed-upon costs incurred by us to expand our manufacturing capacity at our rensselaer, new york facilities. additionally, during 2014, sanofi agreed to fund up to $17.5 million of agreed-upon 2014 and 2015 costs incurred by us in connection with expanding manufacturing capacity at our rensselaer, new york facility.
in 2014, in connection with the antibody collaboration, we purchased an fda priority review voucher from a third party for $67.5 million. we and sanofi equally shared the priority review voucher's purchase price. we subsequently transferred the voucher to sanofi, which used the priority review voucher in connection with the bla submission to the fda for praluent.
with respect to our antibody collaboration with sanofi, $110.6 million was included in accounts receivable as of december 31, 2014. refer to "results of operations" above for sanofi collaboration revenue recognized in connection with our antibody collaboration.
with respect to each antibody product which enters development under the license agreement, sanofi or we may, by giving twelve months notice, opt-out of further development and/or commercialization of the product, in which event the other party retains exclusive rights to continue the development and/or commercialization of the product. we may also opt-out of the further development of an antibody product if we give notice to sanofi within thirty days of the date that sanofi elects to jointly develop such antibody product under the license agreement. each of the discovery agreement and the license agreement contains other termination provisions, including for material breach by the other party. prior to december 31, 2017, sanofi has the right to terminate the amended discovery agreement without cause with at least three months advance written notice; however, except under defined circumstances, sanofi would be obligated to immediately pay to us the full amount of unpaid research funding during the remaining term of the research agreement through december 31, 2017. upon termination of the collaboration in its entirety, our obligation to reimburse sanofi for development costs out of any future profits from collaboration products will terminate.
collaborations with bayer healthcare eylea outside the united states as described above under item 1. "business - collaboration agreements - collaboration with bayer healthcare," since october 2006, we and bayer healthcare have been parties to a license and collaboration agreement for the global development and commercialization outside the united states of eylea.
bayer healthcare markets eylea outside the united states, where, for countries other than japan, the companies share equally in profits and losses from sales of eylea. in japan, we are entitled to receive a tiered percentage of between 33.5% and 40.0% of eylea net sales. we are obligated to reimburse bayer healthcare out of our share of the collaboration profits (including our percentage of sales of eylea in japan) for 50% of the agreed-upon development expenses that bayer healthcare has incurred in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses that bayer healthcare has incurred and our share of the collaboration profits, or at a faster rate at our option. as a result, we expect that, initially, our share of any eylea profits outside the united states will be partly used to reimburse bayer healthcare for this repayment obligation. in particular, our contingent reimbursement obligation to bayer healthcare for eylea was approximately $263 million as of december 31, 2014. we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical and commercial bulk product of eylea to bayer healthcare. within the united states, we are responsible for commercialization of eylea and retain exclusive rights to all future profits from such commercialization in the united states.
since inception of the agreement, we have earned $110.0 million of development milestones and $150.0 million of sales milestones from bayer healthcare. in addition, we may earn an additional $15.0 million sales milestone if twelve-month sales of specific commercial supplies of eylea outside the united states achieve certain specified levels.
under the terms of the agreement, since 2009, all agreed upon eylea development expenses incurred by both companies under a global development plan, and certain commercialization and other expenses, are shared equally, and profits or losses on sales of eylea outside the united states are also shared. refer to "results of operations" above for bayer healthcare collaboration revenue recognized in connection with our eylea collaboration. we also funded $18.6 million, $15.3 million, and $21.9 million of bayer healthcare's eylea development expenses in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, $155.8 million was receivable from bayer healthcare in connection with the companies' eylea collaboration.
77
in january 2014, bayer healthcare decided to participate in the global development and commercialization of eylea outside the united states for the treatment of macular edema following brvo. in connection with this decision, bayer healthcare reimbursed us for a defined share of the eylea global development costs that we had incurred prior to february 2014 for the brvo indication. in addition, all future agreed upon global eylea development expenses incurred in connection with brvo are being shared equally, and profits or losses on sales of eylea outside of the united states for the treatment of macular edema following brvo will also be shared (for countries other than japan). as described above, we are entitled to receive a tiered percentage of eylea net sales in japan.
bayer healthcare has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least six months or twelve months advance notice depending on defined circumstances at the time of termination. in the event of termination of the agreement for any reason, we retain all rights to eylea.
pdgfr-beta antibody outside the united states in january 2014, we entered into an agreement with bayer healthcare governing the joint development and commercialization outside the united states of an antibody product candidate to pdgfr-beta, including in combination with eylea, for the treatment of ocular diseases or disorders. regn2176-3, a combination product candidate comprised of an antibody to pdgfr-beta co-formulated with eylea, is being developed under the agreement. under the agreement, we will conduct the initial development of the pdgfr-beta antibody through completion of the first proof-of-concept study, upon which bayer healthcare will have a right to opt-in to license and collaborate on further development and commercialization outside the united states.
in connection with the agreement, bayer healthcare made a $25.5 million non-refundable upfront payment to us in january 2014, and is obligated to pay 25% of global development costs and 50% of development costs exclusively for the territory outside the united states under the initial development plan. in addition, bayer healthcare is obligated to reimburse us for 50% of development milestone payments to sanofi related to our acquisition of rights to antibodies targeting the pdgf family of receptors in may 2013. in that regard, bayer healthcare made two $2.5 million development milestone payments to us in the first quarter of 2014. further, in connection with our initial development of the pdgfr-beta antibody through completion of the first proof-of-concept study, we are eligible to receive up to $15.0 million in future development milestone payments from bayer healthcare, although certain of these development milestone payments could be reduced by half if bayer healthcare does not opt-in to the collaboration.
if bayer healthcare exercises its right to opt-in to the collaboration, they will obtain exclusive commercialization rights to the product outside the united states, continue to pay for 25% of global development costs and 50% of development costs exclusively for the territory outside the united states, pay a $20 million opt-in payment to us, pay a $20 million development milestone to us upon receipt of the first marketing approval in the european union or japan, share profits and losses from sales outside the united states equally with us, and be responsible for the payment of royalties on sales outside the united states to sanofi.
within the united states, we have exclusive commercialization rights and will retain all of the profits from sales. if bayer healthcare does not opt-in to the collaboration, we will have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize pdgfr-beta antibodies (except as a combination product with eylea) for use outside the united states.
we also have the right to opt-out of the collaboration upon completion of the first proof-of-concept study for the pdgfr-beta antibody. if we opt-out of the collaboration and bayer healthcare exercises its right to opt-in to the collaboration, bayer healthcare will obtain exclusive rights to the pdgfr-beta antibody (except as a combination product with eylea) outside of the united states, be responsible for all development costs outside of the united states, be responsible for all royalty and milestone payments to a third party, and will retain all of the profits from sales of the pdgfr-beta antibody outside of the united states.
unless terminated earlier in accordance with its provisions, the agreement will continue to be in effect until such time as neither party or its respective affiliates or sublicensees is developing or commercializing a pdgfr-beta antibody in the specified field outside of the united states and such discontinuation is acknowledged as permanent by both us and bayer healthcare in writing.
license agreement with astellas in july 2010, the non-exclusive license agreement with astellas was amended and extended through june 2023. under the terms of the amended agreement, astellas made a $165.0 million up-front payment to us in august 2010. in addition, astellas will make a $130.0 million second payment to us in june 2018 unless the license agreement has been terminated prior to that date. astellas has the right to terminate the agreement at any time by providing 90 days' advance written notice. under certain limited circumstances, such as our material breach of the agreement, astellas may terminate the agreement and receive a refund of a portion of its up-front payment or, if such termination occurs after june 2018, a portion of its second payment, to us under the july 2010 amendment to the agreement. we are entitled to receive a mid-single digit royalty on any future sales of antibody products discovered by astellas using our velocimmune technology.
78
royalty agreement with novartis pharma ag under a june 2009 agreement with novartis (that replaced a previous collaboration and license agreement), we receive royalties on worldwide sales of novartis' ilaris, a fully human anti-interleukin-il1ß antibody. the royalty rates in the agreement start at 4% and reach 15% when annual sales exceed $1.5 billion. ilaris is marketed for the treatment of caps and gouty arthritis, and is in earlier stage development for other inflammatory diseases. we are unable to predict whether these royalties will ever contribute materially to our results of operations or financial condition.
license and settlement agreements with genentech in december 2011, we entered into a non-exclusive license and partial settlement agreement with genentech (the original genentech agreement) that covered making, using, and selling eylea in the united states for the prevention and treatment of human eye diseases and disorders in the united states, and ended the litigation relating to those matters. the original genentech agreement provided for us to make payments to genentech based on u.s. sales of eylea through may 7, 2016, the date the davis-smyth patents expire. under the original genentech agreement, we made a $60.0 million milestone payment when cumulative u.s. sales reached $400 million and are obligated to pay royalties of 4.75% on cumulative relevant sales of eylea between $400 million and $3 billion and 5.5% on cumulative relevant sales of eylea over $3 billion.
in may 2013, we entered into an amended and restated non-exclusive license and settlement agreement with genentech (the amended genentech agreement), which amended the original genentech agreement to include all sales of eylea worldwide and ended the litigation relating to those matters. under the amended genentech agreement, we received a worldwide non-exclusive license to the davis-smyth patents, and certain other patents, owned or co-owned by genentech for the prevention or treatment of human eye diseases and eye disorders through administration of eylea to the eye. under the amended genentech agreement, we are obligated to make payments to genentech based on sales of eylea in the united states and eylea manufactured in the united states and sold outside the united states through may 7, 2016 using the same milestone and royalty rates as in the original genentech agreement. eylea is sold outside the united states by affiliates of bayer healthcare under our license and collaboration agreement. all payments to genentech under the original genentech agreement and the amended genentech agreement have been or will be made by regeneron. bayer healthcare will share in all such payments based on the proportion of eylea sales outside the united states to worldwide eylea sales and determined consistent with the license and collaboration agreement.
also in may 2013, we entered into a non-exclusive license and settlement agreement (the zaltrap agreement), with genentech, sanofi u.s. services, inc. and sanofi-aventis u.s. llc (the latter two entities, collectively, sanofi) under which we and sanofi received a worldwide non-exclusive license to the davis-smyth patents, and certain other patents, in all indications for human use other than the prevention or treatment of eye diseases and eye disorders through administration to the eye. under the terms of the zaltrap agreement, payments are required to be made to genentech based on sales of zaltrap in the united states and of zaltrap that is manufactured in the united states and sold outside the united states through may 7, 2016. a payment of $19 million is required to be made upon cumulative relevant sales of zaltrap reaching $200 million. in addition, royalty payments are required to be made to genentech based upon 4.5% of cumulative relevant sales of zaltrap between $400 million and $1 billion and 6.5% of any cumulative relevant sales of zaltrap over $1 billion. all payments to genentech under the zaltrap agreement will be made by sanofi, and we will share in all such payments.
tarrytown, new york leases we lease approximately 706,000 square feet of laboratory and office space at facilities in tarrytown, new york, under a december 2006 lease agreement, as amended. these facilities include approximately 230,000 square feet of space in two newly constructed buildings (buildings a and b) that were completed during the third quarter of 2009 and approximately 131,000 square feet of additional space in a third newly constructed building (building c), that was completed in early 2011. monthly lease payments on buildings a and b commenced in 2009 and in 2011 on building c. in april 2013, we executed an agreement related to approximately 360,000 square feet of space that we currently lease at our tarrytown location, which extended the term of the lease from june 2024 to june 2029; the remaining space will expire in june 2024. the lease contains three renewal options to extend the term of the lease by five years each and early termination options on approximately 323,000 square feet of space. the lease provides for monthly payments over its term and additional charges for utilities, taxes, and operating expenses.
in april 2013, we entered into a new lease agreement for approximately 297,000 square feet of additional new laboratory and office space to be constructed in two new buildings (buildings d and e), which are expected to be completed in the second half of 2015, at our current tarrytown, new york location. the term of the lease, which commenced during the second half of 2014, is approximately 15 years and contains three renewal options to extend the term of the lease by five years each. the lease provides for (i) monthly payments over its term, which are expected to commence in the second half of 2015 and will be based on the landlord's costs of construction and tenant allowances, and (ii) additional charges for utilities, taxes, and operating expenses.
79
certain leased premises are accounted for as operating leases. however, for buildings a, b, c, d, and e (collectively, the buildings) that we are leasing, we are deemed, in substance, to be the owner of the landlord's buildings in accordance with the application of fasb authoritative guidance. consequently, in addition to capitalizing the tenant improvements, we capitalize the landlord's costs of constructing these new facilities, offset by a corresponding facility lease obligation. in addition, we recognize, as additional facility lease obligation, reimbursements from our landlord for tenant improvement costs that we incurred since, under fasb authoritative guidance, such payments that we receive from our landlord are deemed to be a financing obligation. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the buildings' facility lease obligation balance was $312.3 million and $185.2 million, respectively.
capital expenditures our cash expenditures for property, plant, and equipment totaled $333.0 million in 2014, $156.3 million in 2013, and $49.3 million in 2012.
in may 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire a 400,000 square foot facility in limerick, ireland for $5.1 million. we are renovating this facility to accommodate and support our growth, primarily in connection with expanding our manufacturing capacity to support our global supply chain.
we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $650 million to $800 million in 2015 primarily in connection with renovating our new limerick, ireland facility, tenant improvements primarily related to the two new buildings under construction at our leased tarrytown, new york facilities, expanding, and renovating a portion of our manufacturing facilities at our rensselaer, new york facility, and purchases of equipment.
convertible senior notes in october 2011, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes in a private placement. the notes pay interest semi-annually on april 1 and october 1, and will mature on october 1, 2016, unless earlier converted or repurchased. the notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our option. the initial conversion rate for the notes is 11.9021 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances) per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, or a total of approximately 4,760,840 shares upon conversion, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $84.02 per share. a holder of the notes may surrender their notes at their option any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding july 1, 2016, only under the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on december 31, 2011 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the "measurement period") in which the trading price, as defined, of the notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (iii) if we elect to issue to all or substantially all holders of our common stock any rights, options, or warrants (other than pursuant to a rights plan) entitling them for a period of not more than 60 calendar days after the record date for such issuance, to subscribe for or purchase shares of our common stock, at a price per share less than the average of the last reported sales prices of our common stock for the ten consecutive day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the declaration date for such issuance; (iv) upon specified distributions to our shareholders; or (v) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, such as a fundamental change (i.e., a change in control), or our common stock ceasing to be listed on at least one u.s. national securities exchange. on or after july 1, 2016, holders may convert their notes at the conversion rate at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date irrespective of the foregoing conditions. in the event that a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture under which the notes have been issued, occurs prior to maturity of the notes, the initial conversion rate may be increased to include additional shares upon conversion, or holders can require us to purchase from them all or a portion of their notes for 100% of the principal value plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
in connection with the offering of the convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedge (call option) and warrant transactions with multiple counterparties, including an affiliate of the initial purchaser. the convertible note hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock that initially underlie the notes, and are intended to reduce the potential dilutive impact of the conversion feature of the notes. the convertible note hedge will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the notes or the first day the notes are no longer outstanding. the warrant transactions have an initial strike price of approximately $103.41 per share, and may be settled in cash or shares of our common stock, at our option. the warrants will become exercisable (and, if not exercised, will expire) at various dates during 2017.
during 2014, $230.6 million principal amount of our $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes was surrendered for conversion. in accordance with the terms of the notes, we elected to settle these conversion obligations through a combination of cash, in an amount equal to the principal amount of the converted notes, and shares of our common stock in
80
respect of any amounts due in excess thereof. in 2014, as a result of the settlement of $220.6 million of the notes surrendered for conversion, we exercised a proportionate amount of our convertible note hedges, for which we received 2,017,732 shares of common stock, which was equivalent to the number of shares we were required to issue to settle the non-cash portion of the related note conversions. the shares received were recorded as treasury stock. settlement on the remaining notes surrendered in 2014 is anticipated during the first quarter of 2015.
during the first quarter of 2015, we received notification that an additional $6.7 million principal amount of notes were surrendered for conversion, and settlement is anticipated during the first quarter of 2015. we elected to settle these conversion obligations through a combination of cash and shares (total payment will be based on the average of the volume-weighted-average prices of the common stock during the 40 trading-day cash settlement averaging period specified in the indenture governing the notes). in connection with these note conversions, we exercised a proportionate amount of its convertible note hedges, for which we expect to receive shares of common stock equivalent to the number of shares we will be required to issue to settle the non-cash portion of the related note conversions.
during 2014, we entered into agreements to reduce the number of warrants held by warrant holders. pursuant to the agreements, we paid an aggregate amount of $294.6 million to the warrant holders to reduce the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants from 4,760,840 to 3,540,095 (subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in the applicable warrant agreements).
additionally in november 2014, we entered into an amendment agreement with a warrant holder whereby the parties have agreed to reduce a portion of the number of warrants held by the warrant holder by up to a maximum of 493,229, for an aggregate amount payable by us not to exceed $148.5 million. the reduction in the number of warrants will be determined based on the number of warrants with respect to which the warrant holder has closed out its hedge position, provided that the warrant holder does not effect any purchases at a price per share exceeding $397.75 per share, during the period starting on november 26, 2014 and ending no later than february 12, 2015. we are obligated to settle any payments due under the amendment agreement in february 2015. as a result of the warrant holder closing out a portion of its hedge position prior to december 31, 2014, we recorded an accrued liability of $59.8 million with respect to the expected payment to reduce the number of warrants held by such warrant holder by 202,560 as of december 31, 2014. during the first quarter of 2015, the warrant holder closed out additional portions of its hedge position, and, as a result, we expect to pay an additional $62.0 million to further reduce the number of warrants held by such warrant holder by 206,480.
funding requirements we expect continued increases in our expenditures, particularly in connection with our research and development activities (including preclinical and clinical testing), capital expenditures, costs related to the preparation for potential commercialization of our late-stage antibody product candidates, and commercialization of eylea. we believe that our existing capital resources, funds generated by anticipated eylea net product sales, and funding for reimbursement of development costs that we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements will enable us to meet our projected operating needs for the foreseeable future. as described above, research and development expenses that we incur in connection with our antibodies collaboration are generally funded by sanofi, except that following receipt of the first positive phase 3 trial results for a co-developed antibody drug candidate, subsequent phase 3 trial-related costs for that drug candidate are shared 80% by sanofi and 20% by us. in addition, as described above, we and bayer healthcare share (i) agreed-upon development expenses that both companies incur in connection with our eylea collaboration, and (ii) development costs under the initial development plan in connection with our pdgfr-beta antibody collaboration.
81
in connection with our funding requirements, the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2014. these obligations and commitments assume non-termination of agreements and represent expected payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change:
payments due by period
(in millions)                                      total             less than one year             1 to 3 years             3 to 5 years       greater than 5 years convertible senior notes (1)                  $175.7                     $13.2                     $162.5                        -              -
operating leases (2)                           108.6                      10.8                       19.8                    $19.7              $58.3

(1)   consists of $169.4 million remaining aggregate principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes that mature on october 1, 2016, unless earlier converted or repurchased. the amounts in the table above assume the payment of interest on our convertible senior notes through their maturity date and the payment of the principal amount of the notes at their maturity date. interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. the convertible senior notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our option. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
(2)   excludes future contingent costs for utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses. in 2014, these costs were $13.6 million. see note 13(a) to our consolidated financial statements.
(3)   purchase and other obligations primarily relate to (i) a $59.8 million payment expected to be made in february 2015 to a warrant holder (see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements), (ii) research and development commitments, including those related to clinical trials, (iii) capital expenditures for equipment acquisitions, and (iv) license payments. our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may increase or be reduced based on certain future events. open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table above.
(4)   represents payments with respect to facility lease obligations in connection with our lease of buildings a, b, and c in tarrytown, new york, as described under "tarrytown, new york leases" above. in addition to the estimated obligations in the table above, pursuant to a new lease agreement entered into in april 2013, there are two new buildings currently under construction (buildings d and e). rent payments on these buildings are expected to commence in the second half of 2015, and will be based on several factors, including the landlord's costs of construction and tenant allowances. see note 13(a) to our consolidated financial statements.
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, totaling $57.6 million at december 31, 2014, are not included in the table of contractual obligations above as, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the period of potential future cash settlement with taxing authorities. see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements.
we enter into research collaboration and licensing agreements that may require us to pay amounts upon the achievement of various development and commercial milestones, which, in the aggregate, could be significant. additionally, if required by the agreement, we may be required to make royalty payments calculated based on a percentage of net product sales. the payment of these amounts, however, is contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring and for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. because of these factors, such payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations above. see note 4 and note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
under our collaboration agreements with sanofi and bayer healthcare, we and our collaborator will share profits and losses in connection with commercialization of drug products. profits or losses under each collaboration are measured by calculating net sales less cost of goods sold and shared commercialization and other expenses. if the applicable collaboration is profitable, we have contingent contractual obligations to reimburse sanofi and, in connection with eylea outside the united states, bayer healthcare for a defined percentage (generally 50%) of agreed-upon development expenses incurred by sanofi and bayer healthcare, respectively. these reimbursements would be deducted each quarter, in accordance with a formula, from our share of the collaboration profits (and, for our zaltrap collaboration with sanofi and our eylea collaboration with bayer healthcare, our percentage on product sales in japan) otherwise payable to us, unless, in some cases, we elect to reimburse these expenses at a faster rate. in particular, as of december 31, 2014, our contingent reimbursement obligation to sanofi for zaltrap was approximately $461 million, while our contingent reimbursement obligation to bayer healthcare for eylea was approximately $263 million. therefore, we expect that, for the foreseeable future, our share of profits from sales of zaltrap, and a portion of our share of profits from sales of eylea outside the united states, will be used to reimburse our collaborators for these obligations.
82
the amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors, including revenues from net product sales, the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products, and the timing thereof, the status of competitive products, the success of our research and development programs, the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities, the status of patents and other intellectual property rights (and future litigation related thereto), the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates, and the continuation, extent, and success of our collaborations with sanofi and bayer healthcare. clinical trial costs are dependent, among other things, on the size and duration of trials, fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties, the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials, and for supplies, laboratory tests, and other expenses. the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early-stage clinical trials, regulatory requirements, the duration and results of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate, and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above.
our commercialization costs over the next few years will depend on, among other things, whether or not new indications for our marketed products or our antibody product candidates in later stage clinical development receive regulatory approval, the market potential for such new indications or product candidates, and the commercialization terms of our collaboration agreements, if applicable (whereby some or all commercialization costs may be shared with our collaborators). currently, we are required to pay royalties on sales of commercial products. in the future, if we are able to successfully develop, market, and sell eylea for other indications, or certain of our product candidates, we may be required to pay additional royalties or share the profits from such sales pursuant to our license or collaboration agreements. in addition, under the provisions of the ppaca and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010, the branded prescription drug fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. this fee is allocated to companies, including regeneron, based on their market share of total branded prescription drug sales into these government programs.
as described above, in 2014, 2013, and 2012, we made cash payments of $267.6 million, $195.1 million, and $163.3 million, respectively, for employee tax obligations in connection with stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock. future cash requirements for such payments will depend on various factors, including the level of stock option grants and exercises and the sales prices of our common stock, and may continue to be substantial.
we expect that expenses related to the filing, prosecution, defense, and enforcement of patents and other intellectual property will be substantial.
as described under "convertible senior notes" above, in 2014, a portion of our 1.875% convertible senior notes was surrendered for conversion. in future periods, additional notes may be surrendered for conversion. we may also from time to time seek to repurchase or retire our outstanding convertible senior notes, or other outstanding securities, through cash purchases or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise.
due to the amounts of our tax credit carry-forwards available for tax purposes, which totaled approximately $143 million at december 31, 2014, and potential excess tax benefits in connection with stock option exercises, we expect our cash income tax payments for 2015 to be significantly less than the income tax expense recorded in our financial statements in 2015, which is based on an effective tax rate.
in connection with a november 2013 agreement under which bayer healthcare obtained rights to use certain of our eylea clinical data for a regulatory filing, we are eligible to receive an additional $15.0 million sales milestone payment if twelve-month sales of specific commercial supplies of eylea outside the united states exceed $200 million.
in connection with our pdgfr-beta antibody agreement with bayer healthcare, we are eligible to receive up to $15.0 million in future development milestone payments from bayer healthcare (representing 50% of the development milestone payments potentially due to sanofi as described above), although certain of these development milestone payments could be reduced by half if bayer healthcare does not opt-in to the collaboration. furthermore, if bayer healthcare exercises their right to opt-in to the collaboration, they will be obligated to pay a $20.0 million opt-in payment to us, and pay a $20.0 million development milestone to us upon receipt of the first marketing approval in the eu or japan.
other than letters of credits totaling $7.3 million as of december 31, 2014, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. as of december 31, 2014, we had no other banking arrangements that provided short-term financing or lines of credit. in november 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement on form s-3, to replace the shelf registration that expired in october 2013, registering the sale, in one or more offerings, of an indeterminate amount of equity or debt securities, together or separately. there is no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete any offerings of securities under this shelf or other registration statements. factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development and commercialization, investor perception of our prospects, and the general condition of the financial markets.
83
future impact of recently issued accounting standards in may 2014, the fasb issued a new standard related to revenue recognition, revenue from contracts with customers, which will replace existing revenue recognition guidance. the new standard requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. to achieve that core principle, an entity must identify the contract(s) with a customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies the performance obligation. the new standard will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. the standard allows for two transition methods - retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial adoption. we have not yet determined our method of transition and are evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements.

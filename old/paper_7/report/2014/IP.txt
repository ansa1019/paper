item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary operating earnings (a non-gaap measure) is defined as net earnings from continuing operations (a gaap measure) excluding special items and non-operating pension expense. international paper generated operating earnings per diluted share attributable to common shareholders of $3.00 in 2014, compared with $3.06 in 2013, and $2.51 in 2012. diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders were $1.29 in 2014, compared with $3.11 in 2013 and $1.80 in 2012.
international paper delivered strong results during 2014, driven by margin expansion in all our key businesses, most notably in our north american industrial packaging business. we generated record cash flow from operations which enabled the company to return cash to our shareholders in the form of approximately $1 billion in share buy-backs and a 14% increase in the quarterly dividend beginning with the 2014 fourth quarter dividend payment. finally, with respect to our balanced use of cash, we completed a bond issue and related tender offer which enabled us to address outstanding debt due in 2018 and 2019 as well as shift from higher cost to lower cost debt.
our 2014 results reflect continued margin expansion driven by sustained price improvements in our north american industrial packaging business along with improved pricing in our north american printing papers and consumer packaging businesses. in aggregate, volumes were down, largely due to declines in our north american printing papers business following the completion of the courtland mill closure. input costs increased year over year largely due to higher wood costs and higher energy costs, which were impacted by the significant adverse weather events experienced in much of the u.s. during the 2014 first quarter. our ilim joint venture delivered continued solid operational performance in 2014 associated with the productivity ramp-up of the two joint venture funded capital projects and other efficiency improvements. ilim's 2014 results were significantly impacted by unfavorable non-cash foreign currency movements associated with ilim's u.s. dollar denominated debt, particularly in the 2014 fourth quarter. finally, during 2014, we completed the spin-off of the xpedx distribution business which included our receipt of $411 million in special payments.
overall, 2014 reflects our successful efforts to drive margin growth across all of our key businesses. we once again generated returns in excess of our cost of capital while returning cash to our shareholders in the form of increased dividends and share repurchases. we exited
2014 with significant momentum, entering 2015 with a particular focus on execution to drive continued earnings growth and strong free cash flow.
looking ahead to the 2015 first quarter, we expect volume to be largely flat with the exception of seasonally lower volumes in our brazilian and european printing papers businesses. the fourth quarter historically represents the strongest volume quarter for our brazilian printing papers business. pricing is expected to be relatively stable except for our european printing papers and european industrial packaging businesses where pricing pressure continues due to the challenging economic conditions. we expect improved operating performance as we move past the isolated issues that impacted the 2014 fourth quarter in our north american industrial packaging and brazil printing papers businesses. input costs should be relatively stable in the 2015 first quarter with some improvement in the north american industrial packaging business, primarily related to lower energy and fuel costs. planned maintenance downtime costs should increase primarily driven by outages in our north american industrial packaging business. equity earnings from our ilim joint venture are expected to benefit from the absence of the significant negative impact from remeasurement of ilim's u.s. dollar denominated debt due to devaluation of the russian ruble in the 2014 fourth quarter.
for the 2015 full year, we anticipate an overall challenging macroeconomic environment but expect to benefit from the strengthening u.s. economy. even in those markets facing economic headwinds, namely brazil and russia, our low cost export position should enable us to effectively navigate these challenges. there continues to be significant optimization opportunities in our north american industrial packaging business which we expect to further realize during 2015. additionally, we expect improvement in the results of our brazilian industrial packaging business along with the benefits of continued margin expansion at the ilim joint venture. we also expect to take further advantage of the growing demand for fiber-based food packaging. in addition, we expect to realize the benefits of the repositioned north american printing papers business following the completion of the courtland mill closure. finally, we expect to generate strong free cash flow results but we do expect some impact from higher cash taxes driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings and other non-repeating events that benefitted 2014 cash taxes.
free cash flow (a non-gaap measure) of $2.1 billion generated in 2014 was higher than the $1.8 billion generated in 2013 and the $1.6 billion generated in 2012 (see reconciliation on page 32).
operating earnings per share attributable to common shareholders of $0.53 in the 2014 fourth quarter were lower than the $0.95 in the 2014 third quarter and the $0.81 in the 2013 fourth quarter. diluted earnings (loss)
19
per share attributable to common shareholders were $0.32 in the 2014 fourth quarter, compared with $0.83 in the 2014 third quarter and $0.98 in the 2013 fourth quarter.
free cash flow of $739 million generated in the 2014 fourth quarter was higher than the $696 million generated in the 2014 third quarter and the $598 million generated in the 2013 fourth quarter (see reconciliation on page 32).
operating earnings and operating earnings per share are non-gaap measures. diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure. the company calculates operating earnings by excluding the after-tax effect of items considered by management to be unusual from the earnings reported under gaap, non-operating pension expense and discontinued operations. management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. the company believes that using this information, along with the most directly comparable gaap measure, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations. the following are reconciliations of operating earnings per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders to diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders.

industry segment operating profits in 2014 included a net loss from special items of $732 million compared with $336 million in 2013 and $286 million in 2012. operationally, compared with 2013, the benefit from higher average sales price realizations and favorable mix ($563 million) and lower other costs ($16 million) were offset by lower sales volumes ($35 million), higher operating costs ($138 million), higher input costs ($141 million), higher maintenance outage costs ($3 million) and higher costs associated with the closure of our courtland, alabama mill ($41 million).
the principal changes in operating profit by segment were as follows:
•   industrial packaging's profits of $1.9 billion were $95 million higher than in 2013 as the net benefit of higher average sales price realizations and mix were partially offset by lower sales volumes, higher operating costs, higher maintenance outage costs and higher input costs. in addition, 2014 operating profits included $16 million of costs associated with the integration of temple-inland, a goodwill impairment charge of $100 million related to our asia industrial packaging business, a charge of $35 million for costs associated with a multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liability and a net charge of $7 million for other items. operating profits in 2013 included $62 million of costs associated with the integration of temple-inland and a $13 million gain for a bargain purchase adjustment on the acquisition of a majority share of our operations in turkey.
•   printing papers' operating loss of $16 million represented a $287 million reduction in operating profits from 2013. the benefits of higher average sales price realizations and a more favorable mix, lower maintenance outage costs, the absence of a provision for bad debt related to a large envelope customer that was booked in 2013, and lower foreign exchange and other costs were more than offset by lower sales volumes, higher operating costs, higher input costs and higher costs associated with the closure of our courtland, alabama mill. the 2014 operating loss also included a special items charge of $554 million for costs associated with the shutdown of our courtland, alabama mill, a gain of $20 million for the resolution of a legal contingency in india and a charge of $32 million for costs associated with a foreign tax amnesty program. operating profits in 2013 included $118 million of costs associated with the shutdown of our courtland, alabama mill and net charges of $123 million for the
21
impairment of the goodwill and a trade name intangible asset of the company's india papers business.
•   consumer packaging's profits of $178 million were $17 million higher than in 2013. the benefits from higher average sales price realizations and a favorable mix were more than offset by lower sales volumes, higher operating costs, higher planned maintenance downtime costs, higher input costs and higher other expenses. operating profits in 2014 included $8 million of sheet plant closure costs. operating profits in 2013 included costs of $45 million associated with the permanent shutdown of a paper machine at our augusta, georgia mill.
corporate items, net, of $51 million of expense in 2014 were lower than the $61 million of expense in 2013 due to lower pension costs partially offset by a one-time non-cash foreign exchange charge related to the administrative restructuring of some international entities. the decrease in 2013 from the expense of $87 million in 2012 primarily reflects lower supply chain initiative expenses.
corporate special items, including restructuring and other items and net losses on sales and impairments of businesses were a loss of $320 million in 2014 compared with a loss of $4 million in 2013 and a loss of $49 million in 2012. the higher loss in 2014 is due to higher debt extinguishment costs and a loss on the sale of a business by asg, in which we hold an investment, and the subsequent partial impairment of our asg investment interest expense, net, was $607 million ($601 million excluding special items net interest expense reported in the printing papers business segment) in 2014 compared with $612 million in 2013 and $671 million in 2012. the decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 reflects lower average interest rates. the decrease in 2013 compared with 2012 reflects lower average debt levels and the reversal of interest reserves related to u.s. federal income tax audits.
a net income tax provision of $123 million was recorded for 2014, including a tax benefit of $90 million related to internal restructurings and a net tax expense of $9 million for other items. the 2013 income tax benefit of $498 million includes a tax benefit of $770 million associated with the settlement of tax audits and a net tax benefit of $4 million for other items. the 2012 income tax provision of $306 million includes a net expense of $14 million related to internal restructurings and an expense of $5 million to adjust deferred tax assets related to post-retirement prescription drug coverage (medicare part d reimbursements).
discontinued operations
2014: on july 1, 2014, international paper completed the spinoff of its distribution business, xpedx, which subsequently merged with unisource worldwide, inc., with the combined companies now operating as veritiv corporation (veritiv). the xpedx business had historically represented the company's distribution reportable segment.
the spinoff was accomplished by the contribution of the xpedx business to veritiv and the distribution of 8,160,000 shares of veritiv common stock on a pro-rata basis to international paper shareholders. international paper received payments of approximately $411 million, financed with new debt in veritiv's capital structure.
2013: on april 1, 2013, the company finalized the sale of temple-inland's 50% interest in del-tin fiber l.l.c. to joint venture partner deltic timber corporation for $20 million in assumed liabilities and cash.
on july 19, 2013 the company finalized the sale of its temple-inland building products division to georgia-pacific building products, llc for approximately $726 million in cash.
2012: upon the acquisition of temple-inland, management committed to a plan to sell the temple-inland building products business, and on december 12, 2012, international paper reached an agreement to sell the business (including del-tin fiber l.l.c.) to georgia-pacific for $750 million in cash, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including satisfactory review by the doj, and to certain pre-and post-closing purchase price adjustments. the assets to be sold included 16 manufacturing facilities.
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december 31, 2014, international paper generated $3.1 billion of cash flow from operations compared with $3.0 billion in 2013. cash flow from operations included $353 million and $31 million of cash pension contributions in 2014 and 2013, respectively. capital spending for 2014 totaled $1.4 billion, or 97% of depreciation and amortization expense. net decreases in debt totaled $113 million. our liquidity position remains strong, supported by approximately $2.0 billion of credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future liquidity requirements. maintaining an investment-grade credit rating for our long-term debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy.
we expect to generate strong free cash flow again in 2015 and will continue our balanced use of cash through investments in capital projects, the reduction of total debt, including the company's unfunded pension obligation, returning value to shareholders and strengthening our
22
businesses through strategic acquisitions, as appropriate.
capital spending for 2015 is targeted at $1.5 billion, or about 105% of depreciation and amortization.

corporate overview while the operating results for international paper's various business segments are driven by a number of business-specific factors, changes in international paper's operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in north america, europe, russia, latin america, asia, africa and the middle east. factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels, and movements in currency exchange rates.
product prices are affected by general economic trends, inventory levels, currency exchange rate movements and worldwide capacity utilization. in addition to these revenue-related factors, net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers, the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs, principally wood, recycled fiber and chemical costs; energy costs; freight costs; salary and benefits costs, including pensions; and manufacturing conversion costs.
the following is a discussion of international paper's results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014, and the major factors affecting these results compared to 2013 and 2012.
results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014, international paper reported net sales of $23.6 billion, compared with $23.5 billion in 2013 and $21.9 billion in 2012. international net sales (including u.s. exports) totaled $9.3 billion or 39% of total sales in 2014. this compares with international net sales of $9.5 billion in 2013 and $8.4 billion in 2012.
full year 2014 net earnings attributable to international paper company totaled $555 million ($1.29 per share), compared with net earnings of $1.4 billion ($3.11 per share) in 2013 and $794 million ($1.80 per share) in 2012. amounts in all periods include the results of discontinued operations.
earnings from continuing operations attributable to international paper company after taxes in 2014 were
$568 million, including $599 million of net special items charges and $129 million of non-operating pension expense compared with $1.7 billion, including $528 million of net special items gains and $197 million of non-operating pension expense in 2013, and $717 million, including $272 million of net special items charges and $113 million of non-operating pension expense in 2012. compared with 2013, the benefit from higher average sales price realizations and mix, lower corporate and other costs and lower interest expense were offset by lower sales volumes, higher operating costs, higher maintenance outage costs, higher input costs, higher costs associated with the closure of the courtland mill, and higher tax expense. in addition, 2014 results included lower equity earnings, net of taxes, relating to the company's investment in ilim holdings, sa.

special items restructuring and other charges international paper continually evaluates its operations for improvement opportunities targeted to (a) focus our portfolio on our core businesses, (b) rationalize and realign capacity to operate fewer facilities with the same revenue capability and close high cost facilities, and (c) reduce costs. annually, strategic operating plans are developed by each of our businesses. if it subsequently becomes apparent that a facility's plan will not be achieved, a decision is then made to (a) invest additional capital to upgrade the facility, (b) shut down the facility and record the corresponding charge, or (c) evaluate the expected recovery of the carrying value of the facility to determine if an impairment of the asset value of the facility has occurred. in recent years, this policy has led to the shutdown of a number of facilities and the recording of significant asset impairment charges and severance costs. it is possible that additional charges and costs will be incurred in future periods in our core businesses should such triggering events occur.

printing papers demand for printing papers products is closely correlated with changes in commercial printing and advertising activity, direct mail volumes and, for uncoated cut-size products, with changes in white-collar employment levels that affect the usage of copy and laser printer paper. pulp is further affected by changes in currency rates that can enhance or disadvantage producers in different geographic
28
regions. principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency, raw material and energy costs and freight costs.

liquidity and capital resources overview a major factor in international paper's liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow, which is highly sensitive to changes in the
31
pricing and demand for our major products. while changes in key cash operating costs, such as energy, raw material and transportation costs, do have an effect on operating cash generation, we believe that our focus on pricing and cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle.
cash uses during 2014 were primarily focused on working capital requirements, capital spending, debt reductions and returning cash to shareholders.
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operations totaled $3.1 billion in 2014 compared with $3.0 billion for 2013 and $3.0 billion for 2012.
the major components of cash provided by operations are earnings from operations adjusted for non-cash income and expense items, cash pension contributions and changes in working capital. earnings from operations, adjusted for non-cash income and expense items and cash pension contributions decreased by $279 million in 2014 versus 2013 driven mainly by increased cash pension contributions in 2014. cash used for working capital components, accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, interest payable and other totaled $158 million in 2014, compared with a cash use of $486 million in 2013 and cash provided of $84 million in 2012.
the company generated free cash flow of approximately $2.1 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. free cash flow is a non-gaap measure and the most comparable gaap measure is cash provided by operations. management uses free cash flow as a liquidity metric because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available to maintain our assets, make investments or acquisitions, pay dividends and reduce debt. the following are reconciliations of free cash flow to cash provided by operations:

acquisitions and joint ventures olmuksan
2014: in may 2014, the company conducted a voluntary tender offer for the remaining outstanding 12.6% public shares of olmuksan. the company also purchased outstanding shares of olmuksan outside of the tender offer. as of december 31, 2014, the company owned 91.7% of olmuksan's outstanding and issued shares.
2013: on january 3, 2013, international paper completed the acquisition (effective date of acquisition on january 1, 2013) of the shares of its joint venture partner, sabanci holding, in the turkish corrugated packaging company, olmuksa international paper sabanci ambalaj sanayi ve ticaret a.s., now called olmuksan international paper ambalaj sanayi ve ticaret a.s. (olmuksan), for a purchase price of $56 million. the acquired shares represented 43.7% of olmuksan's shares. prior to this acquisition, international paper held a 43.7% equity interest in olmuksan.
because the transaction resulted in international paper becoming the majority shareholder, owning 87.4% of olmuksan's outstanding and issued shares, its completion triggered a mandatory call for tender of the remaining public shares which began in march 2013 and ended in april 2013, with no shares tendered. as a result, the 12.6% owned by other parties were considered non-controlling interests. olmuksan's financial results have been consolidated with the company's industrial packaging segment beginning january 1, 2013, the effective date which international paper obtained majority control of the entity.
following the transaction, the company's previously held 43.7% equity interest in olmuksan was remeasured to a fair value of $75 million, resulting in a gain of $9 million. in addition, the cumulative translation adjustment balance of $17 million relating to the previously held equity interest was reclassified, as expense, from accumulated other comprehensive income.
the final purchase price allocation indicated that the sum of the cash consideration paid, the fair value of the noncontrolling interest and the fair value of the previously held interest was less than the fair value of the underlying assets by $21 million, resulting in a bargain purchase price gain being recorded on this transaction. the aforementioned remeasurement of equity interest gain, the cumulative translation adjustment to expense, and the bargain purchase gain are included in the net bargain purchase gain on acquisition of business in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
orsa
2014: on april 8, 2014, the company acquired the remaining 25% of shares of orsa international paper embalangens s.a. (orsa ip) from its joint venture partner, jari celulose, papel e embalagens s.a. (jari), a grupo orsa company, for approximately $127 million, of which $105 million was paid in cash with the remaining $22 million held back pending satisfaction of certain indemnification obligations by jari. international paper will release the amount held back, or any amount for which we have not notified jari of a claim, by march 30, 2016. an additional $11 million, which was not included in the purchase price, was placed in an escrow account pending resolution of certain open matters. during 2014, these open matters were successfully resolved, which resulted in $9 million paid out of escrow to jari and correspondingly added to the final purchase consideration. the remaining $2 million was released back to the company. as a result of this transaction, the company reversed the $168 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest included on the march 31, 2014 consolidated balance sheet. the net difference between the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance plus $14 million of currency translation adjustment reclassified out of other comprehensive income less the 25% purchase price was reflected as an increase to retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheet.
2013: on january 14, 2013, international paper and jari formed orsa ip with international paper holding a 75% stake. the value of international paper's investment in orsa ip was approximately $471 million. because international paper acquired a majority control of the joint venture, orsa ip's financial results have been consolidated with our industrial packaging segment from the date of formation on january 14, 2013. the 25% owned by jari was considered a redeemable noncontrolling interest and met the requirements to be classified outside permanent equity. as such, the company reported $163 million in redeemable noncontrolling interest in the december 31, 2013 consolidated balance sheet.
temple-inland, inc.
2012: on february 13, 2012, international paper completed the acquisition of temple-inland, inc.

(a)   total debt includes scheduled principal payments only.
(b)   represents debt obligations borrowed from non-consolidated variable interest entities for which international paper has, and intends to effect, a legal right to offset these obligations with investments held in the entities. accordingly, in its consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2014, international paper has offset approximately $5.2 billion of interests in the entities against this $5.3 billion of debt obligations held by the entities (see note 12 variable interest entities and preferred securities of subsidiaries on pages 67 through 69 in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data).
(c)   includes $2.3 billion relating to fiber supply agreements entered into at the time of the 2006 transformation plan forestland sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of weyerhaeuser company's containerboard, packaging and recycling business.
(d)   not included in the above table due to the uncertainty as to the amount and timing of the payment are unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $119 million.
as discussed in note 12 variable interest entities and preferred securities of subsidiaries on pages 67 through 69 in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, in connection with the 2006 international paper installment sale of forestlands, we received $4.8 billion of installment notes (or timber notes), which we contributed to certain non-consolidated borrower entities. the installment notes mature in august 2016 (unless extended). the deferred
35
tax liability of $1.4 billion related to the 2006 forestlands sale will be settled in connection with the maturity of the timber notes. the entities to which these installment notes were contributed used the installment notes as collateral for $4.8 billion of borrowings from third-party lenders. of these third-party loans, $4.1 billion mature in september 2015. failure to extend, renew or refinance these third-party loans prior to their stated maturity, which we believe is unlikely, could trigger the sale of the installment notes to facilitate the $4.1 billion debt payment which, in turn, would result in an acceleration of the payment of the deferred income taxes that resulted from the 2006 forestlands sale. as a result, we could have tax payment obligations of approximately $1.2 billion in 2015. we expect we would fund these tax payments, if required, from current cash balances, cash from operations, borrowings under our existing credit facilities, accessing capital markets, or a combination thereof.
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2014, to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no u.s. income taxes have been provided thereon. as of december 31, 2014, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $1 billion. we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.
pension obligations and funding at december 31, 2014, the projected benefit obligation for the company's u.s. defined benefit plans determined under u.s. gaap was approximately $3.8 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets. approximately $3.4 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements. under current irs funding rules, the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits(the projected benefit obligation) for accounting purposes. in december 2008, the worker, retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 (wera) was passed by the u.s. congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections. funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company, and the timing of its implementation, as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level. the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected to make contributions totaling $353 million and $31 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. at this time, we expect that required contributions to its plans in 2015 will be approximately $63 million, although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions. the timing and amount of future contributions, which could be material, will depend on a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.
ilim holding s.a. shareholder's agreement in october 2007, in connection with the formation of the ilim holding s.a. joint venture, international paper entered into a shareholder's agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners. this agreement was amended on may 7, 2014. pursuant to the amended agreement, beginning on january 1, 2017, either the company or its partners may commence certain procedures specified under the deadlock provisions. if these or any other deadlock provisions are commenced, the company may in certain situations, choose to purchase its partners' 50% interest in ilim. any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant antitrust authorities. any such purchase by international paper would result in the consolidation of ilim's financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods.
critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.
accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper, and that can require judgments by management that affect their application, include the accounting for contingencies, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and goodwill, pensions and postretirement benefit obligations, stock options and income taxes. the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit committee of the company's board of directors.
contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities, including legal and environmental matters, are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel. liabilities for
36
environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs.
impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill an impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations. a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. assessments of possible impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. additionally, testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually. the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management's best estimates of certain key factors, including future selling prices and volumes, operating, raw material, energy and freight costs, and various other projected operating economic factors. as these key factors change in future periods, the company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections.
under the provisions of accounting standards codification (asc) 350, "intangibles - goodwill and other," the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a two-step process. in the first step, the fair value of the company's reporting units is compared with their carrying value, including goodwill. if fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered to be impaired. if the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value, then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit. this analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any currently unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date. once these fair values have been determined, the implied fair value of the unit's goodwill is calculated as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two. the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value, or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, through a goodwill impairment charge.
the impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management. in calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one, the company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the unit's assets, discounted using the estimated cost-of-capital discount rate for each reporting unit. these calculations require many estimates, including discount rates, future growth rates, and cost and pricing trends for each reporting unit. subsequent changes in economic and operating conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in future periods. upon completion, the resulting estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to earnings multiples for historic industry business transactions, and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the company's market price per share on the analysis date.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the company calculated the estimated fair value of its asia industrial packaging business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill in this business, totaling $100 million, should be written off. the decline in the fair value of the asia industrial packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the strategic outlook for the business.
in the fourth quarter of 2013, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the company calculated the estimated fair value of its india papers business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill of this business, totaling $112 million, should be written off. the decline in the fair value of the india papers reporting unit and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the strategic outlook for the india papers operations.
also in the fourth quarter of 2013, the company calculated the estimated fair value of its xpedx business using the discounted future cash flows and wrote off all of the goodwill of its xpedx business, totaling $400 million. the decline in fair value of the xpedx reporting unit and resulting impairment charge was due to a significant decline in earnings and a change in the strategic outlook for the xpedx operations. as a result, during the fourth quarter of 2013, the company recorded a total goodwill impairment charge of $512 million ($485 million after taxes and a gain of $3 million related to noncontrolling interest), representing all of the recorded goodwill of the xpedx business and the india papers business.
also during 2013, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $15 million ($7 million after taxes and noncontrolling interest) for the impairment of a trade name intangible asset related to our india papers business.
37
no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2012.
pension and postretirement benefit obligations the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper's consulting actuary, and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates.
the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities, the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates.
benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31, 2014, for international paper's pension and postretirement plans were as follows:
in millions                       benefit       fair value of obligation       plan assets u.s. qualified pension            $14,343       $10,918
u.s. nonqualified pension             398       -
u.s. postretirement                   306       -
non-u.s. pension                      233                   180
non-u.s. postretirement                59       -
the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate u.s. pension obligations for the years shown:
2014                                   2013        2012

rate of compensation increase   3.75   %    3.75   %    3.75   %
additionally, health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of u.s. postretirement obligations for the years shown were:
2014                                                                 2013
health care cost trend rate assumed for next year             7.00   %    7.00   %
rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to           5.00   %    5.00   %
year that the rate reaches the rate it is assumed to remain   2022   2017
international paper determines these actuarial assumptions, after consultation with our actuaries, on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan's investment portfolio. the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds.
the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31, 2014 was 7.75%.
increasing (decreasing) the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets by an additional 0.25% would decrease (increase) 2015 pension expense by approximately $25 million, while a (decrease) increase of 0.25% in the discount rate would (increase) decrease pension expense by approximately $36 million. the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1% increase or decrease in the annual health care cost trend rate would be approximately $1 million.
actual rates of return earned on u.s. pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were:
year       return   year        return
2014    6.4   %     2009    23.8   %
2013   14.1   %     2008   (23.6   )%
2012   14.1   %     2007     9.6   %
2011    2.5   %     2006    14.9   %
2010   15.1   %     2005    11.7   %
the 2012, 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and temple-inland asset returns. international paper and temple-inland assets were combined in october 2014. the annualized time-weighted rate of return earned on u.s. pension plan assets was 10.3% and 8.1% for the past five and ten years, respectively. the following graph shows the growth of a $1,000 investment in international paper's u.s. pension plan master trust. the graph portrays the time-weighted rate of return from 2004 - 2014.
asc 715, "compensation - retirement benefits," provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to
38
changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets, and other assumption changes. these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years. the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost for the u.s. pension plans over the next fiscal year are $475 million and $43 million, respectively.
net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses, calculated for all of international paper's plans, were as follows:
in millions                 2014          2013          2012          2011          2010
pension expense u.s. plans (non-cash)       $387          $545          $342          $195          $231
non-u.s. plans                 -             5             3             1             -
postretirement expense u.s. plans                     7            (1   )        (4   )         7             6
non-u.s. plans                 7             7             1             2             1
net expense                 $401          $556          $342          $205          $238
the decrease in 2014 u.s. pension expense principally reflects an increase in the discount rate and lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses. the increase in 2014 u.s. postretirement expense is principally due to lower amortization of prior service credits.
assuming that discount rates, expected long-term returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2014, projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows:
in millions                 2016 (1)         2015 (1)
pension expense u.s. plans (non-cash)           $390             $488
non-u.s. plans                     6                7
postretirement expense u.s. plans                        13                9
non-u.s. plans                     7                6
net expense                     $416             $510
(1)   based on assumptions at december 31, 2014.
the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately $488 million for its u.s. defined benefit plans in 2015, with the increase from expense of $387 million in 2014 reflecting a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 4.10% in 2015 from 4.65% in 2014, updated mortality assumptions and higher unrecognized losses.
the market value of plan assets for international paper's u.s. qualified pension plan at december 31, 2014 totaled approximately $10.9 billion, consisting of approximately 47% equity securities, 33% debt securities, 10% real estate and 10% other assets. plan assets include an immaterial amount of international paper common stock.
the company's funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the company, and other factors. the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future. the required contribution for the u.s. qualified pension plans in 2015 is approximately $63 million. the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments, which totaled $38 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
accounting for stock options international paper follows asc 718, "compensation - stock compensation," in accounting for stock options. under this guidance, expense for stock options is recorded over the related service period based on the grant-date fair market value.
during each reporting period, diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that "in-the-money" options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace. when options are actually exercised, option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share, with no effect on reported earnings. equity is also increased by the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns.
at december 31, 2014 and 2013, 0.07 million options, and 1.8 million options, respectively, were outstanding with exercise prices of $39.03 per share for 2014 and a range of $38.41 to $48.19 per share for 2013.
39
income taxes international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the company's evaluation of the "more likely than not" outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, change in tax laws, or a recent court case that addresses the matter.
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies.
while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.
the company's effective income tax rates, before equity earnings and discontinued operations, were 14%, (41)% and 32% for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year, but may not recur in subsequent years. management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur in those years. excluding these special items, the effective income tax rate for 2014 was 31% of pre-tax earnings compared with 26% in 2013 and 28% in 2012. we estimate that the 2015 effective income tax rate will be approximately 33% based on expected earnings and business conditions.
recent accounting developments there were no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year which have had or are expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements. see note 2 recent accounting developments on pages 53 and 54 of

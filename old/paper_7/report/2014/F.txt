item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
overview revenue our automotive sector's revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, and accessories; we generally treat sales and marketing incentives as a reduction to revenue. revenue is recorded when all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and distributors). for the majority of sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities. this is not the case, however, with respect to vehicles produced for sale to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option. these vehicles are accounted for as operating leases, with lease revenue and profits recognized over the term of the lease. when we sell the returned vehicle at auction, we recognize a gain or loss on the difference, if any, between actual auction value and the projected auction value.
most of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by ford credit. upon ford credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealer's purchase of a vehicle, ford credit pays cash to the relevant legal entity in our automotive sector in payment of the dealer's obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle. the dealer then pays the wholesale finance receivable to ford credit when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer.
our financial services sector's revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables, net of certain deferred origination costs that are included as a reduction of financing revenue, and such revenue is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method. also, revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. income is generated to the extent revenues exceed expenses, most of which are interest, depreciation, and operating expenses.
transactions between our automotive and financial services sectors occur in the ordinary course of business. for example, we offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers' customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from ford credit. the estimated cost for these incentives is recorded as revenue reduction to automotive sales at the later of the date the related vehicle sales to our dealers are recorded or the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated. in order to compensate ford credit for the lower interest or lease rates offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to ford credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer's customer. ford credit recognizes the amount over the life of retail finance contracts as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a reduction to depreciation. see note 1 of the notes to the financial statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions and payments between our automotive and financial services sectors.
costs and expenses our income statement classifies our automotive total costs and expenses into two categories: (i) cost of sales, and (ii) selling, administrative, and other expenses. we include within cost of sales those costs related to the development, manufacture, and distribution of our vehicles, parts, and accessories. specifically, we include in cost of sales each of the following: material costs (including commodity costs); freight costs; warranty, including product recall and customer satisfaction program costs; labor and other costs related to the development and manufacture of our products; depreciation and amortization; and other associated costs. we include within selling, administrative, and other expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development and manufacture of our products, including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs.
certain of our costs, such as material costs, generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production. in our industry, production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. quarterly production volumes experience seasonal shifts throughout the year (including peak retail sales seasons, and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launches). as we have seen in recent years, annual production volumes are heavily impacted by external economic factors, including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel.
28
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
as a result, we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant present-year volume and mix and currency exchange, in order to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange levels. we analyze these cost changes in the following categories:
•   material excluding commodity costs - primarily reflecting the change in cost of purchased parts used in the assembly of our vehicles.
•   commodity costs - reflecting the change in cost for raw materials (such as steel, aluminum, and resins) used in the manufacture of our products.
•   structural costs - reflecting the change in costs that generally do not have a directly proportionate relationship to our production volumes, such as labor costs, including pension and health care; other costs related to the development and manufacture of our vehicles; depreciation and amortization; and advertising and sales promotion costs.
•   warranty and other costs - reflecting the change in cost related to warranty coverage, field service actions, and customer satisfaction actions, as well as the change in freight and other costs related to the distribution of our vehicles and support for the sale and distribution of parts and accessories.
while material (including commodity), freight, and warranty costs generally vary directly in proportion to production volume, elements within our structural costs category are impacted to differing degrees by changes in production volume. we also have varying degrees of discretion when it comes to controlling the different elements within our structural costs. for example, depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decisions. on the other hand, while labor costs do not vary directly with production volume, manufacturing labor costs may be impacted by changes in volume, for example when we increase overtime, add a production shift or add personnel to support volume increases. other structural costs, such as advertising or engineering costs, do not necessarily have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. our structural costs generally are within our discretion, although to varying degrees, and can be adjusted over time in response to external factors.
we consider certain structural costs to be a direct investment in future growth and revenue. for example, increases in structural costs are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability as we expand around the world, invest in new products and technologies, respond to increasing industry sales volume, and grow our market share.
automotive total costs and expenses for full-year 2014 was $133.8 billion. material costs (including commodity costs) make up the largest portion of our automotive total costs and expenses, representing in 2014 about two-thirds of the total amount. of the remaining balance of our automotive costs and expenses, the largest piece is structural costs. although material costs are our largest absolute cost, our margins can be affected significantly by changes in any category of costs.
key economic factors and trends affecting the automotive industry currency exchange rate volatility. the u.s. federal reserve has ended financial asset purchases, and the resulting shifts in capital flows have contributed to downward pressure on several emerging market currencies. in some cases that pressure is aggravated by high inflation, unstable policy environments, or both. additionally, the yen and euro have depreciated as a result of policy changes by the bank of japan, and european central bank.  the weak yen, in particular, adds significant potential downward pressure on vehicle pricing across many markets globally.  in most markets, exchange rates are market-determined, and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factors, and thus likely to remain volatile.  however, in some markets, exchange rates are heavily influenced or controlled by governments.
excess capacity. according to ihs automotive, an automotive research firm, the estimated automotive industry global production capacity for light vehicles of about 116 million units exceeded global production by about 29 million units in 2014.  in north america and europe, two regions where a significant share of industry revenue is earned, excess capacity as a percent of production in 2014 was an estimated 7% and 30%, respectively. in china, the auto industry also witnessed excess capacity at 45% of production in 2014, as manufacturers competed to capitalize on china's future market potential. according to production capacity data projected by ihs automotive, global excess capacity conditions could continue for several years at an average of about 32 million units per year during the period from 2015 to 2019.
pricing pressure. excess capacity, coupled with a proliferation of new products being introduced in key segments, will keep pressure on manufacturers' ability to increase prices.  in north america, the industry restructuring of the past few years has allowed manufacturers to better match production with demand, although japanese and korean manufacturers also have capacity located outside of the region directed to north america.  in the future, chinese and indian manufacturers are expected to enter u.s. and european markets, further intensifying competition.  over the long term, intense competition and excess capacity will continue to put downward pressure on inflation-adjusted prices for similarly-
29
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
contented vehicles in the united states and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry.  in europe, the excess capacity situation was exacerbated by weakening demand and the lack of reductions in existing capacity, such that negative pricing pressure is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
commodity and energy price changes. the price of oil fell sharply in the second half of 2014, to below $50 per barrel, as demand was weaker than anticipated and global supply remained strong. other commodity prices also have declined recently, but over the longer term prices are likely to trend higher given expectations for global demand growth.
vehicle profitability. our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which may vary significantly by vehicle line. in general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles, both across and within vehicle segments. for example, in north america, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was about 140% of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins. government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to the consumer. given the backdrop of excess capacity, these regulations could dampen contribution margins. as we execute our one ford plan, we are working to create best-in-class vehicles on global platforms that contribute higher margins, and offering a more balanced portfolio of vehicles with which we aim to be among the leaders in fuel efficiency in every segment in which we compete.
increasing sales of smaller vehicles. like other manufacturers, we are increasing our participation in newly-developed and emerging markets, such as brazil, russia, india, and china, in which vehicle sales are expected to increase at a faster rate than in most mature markets. the largest segments in these markets are small vehicles (i.e., sub-b, b, and c segments). to increase our participation in these fast-growing markets, we are significantly increasing our production capacity, directly or through joint ventures. although we expect positive contribution margins from higher small vehicle sales, one result of increased production of small vehicles may be that, over time, our average per unit margin decreases because small vehicles tend to have lower margins than medium and large vehicles.
trade policy. to the extent governments in various regions erect or intensify barriers to imports, or implement currency policy that advantages local exporters selling into the global marketplace, there can be a significant negative impact on manufacturers based in markets that promote free trade.  while we believe the long-term trend is toward the growth of free trade, we have noted with concern recent developments in a number of regions.  in asia pacific africa, for example, the recent dramatic depreciation of the yen significantly reduces the cost of exports into the united states, europe, and other global markets by japanese manufacturers.  over a period of time, the emerging weakness of the yen can contribute to other countries pursuing weak currency policies by intervening in the exchange rate markets.  this is particularly likely in other asian countries, such as south korea.  as another example, government actions in south america to incentivize local production and balance trade are driving trade frictions between south american countries and also with mexico, resulting in business environment instability and new trade barriers.  we will continue to monitor and address developing issues around trade policy.
other economic factors. during 2014, mature market government bond yields and inflation were lower than expected, and there is a rising risk of persistent disinflation and, in some markets, even outright deflation. the lower levels of inflation and interest rates were unexpected partially because they have occurred against a backdrop of loose monetary policy and high levels of mature market deficits and debt. the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, with potentially higher long-term interest rates, may still drive a higher cost of capital over our planning period.  higher interest rates and/or taxes to address the higher deficits also may impede real growth in gross domestic product and, therefore, vehicle sales over our planning period.

trends and strategies our priorities are: (1) accelerate the pace of progress of our one ford plan, (2) deliver product excellence with passion, and (3) drive innovation in every part of our business.
accelerate the pace of progress of our one ford plan our first priority is to accelerate the pace of progress of our one ford plan. the one ford plan has been fundamental to the progress we have made in recent years, and it is fundamental to our performance going forward. in many ways we are starting to see the full benefits and strength of the one ford plan, and we see an opportunity to accelerate our pace of progress to drive operational excellence and profitable growth for all.
31
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
deliver product excellence with passion our second priority is to deliver product excellence with passion. products are the lifeblood of our business and our one ford plan has allowed us to field the best product line-up we have ever had and one of the freshest.
in 2014, we launched 24 all-new or significantly refreshed products globally, including the all-new f-150, mustang, escort, ka, transit, and lincoln mkc. our momentum will continue in 2015 with 15 new global product launches.
our strategy is to serve customers in all markets with a full family of best in class vehicles-small, medium and large; cars, utilities and trucks; each delivering the highest quality, fuel efficiency, safety, smart design, and value-and delivering profitable growth for all.
the fundamentals of our global product plan have not changed. our vision is to produce vehicles that:
•   have bold, emotive exterior designs
•are great to drive
•   are great to sit in (second home comfort, convenience, exceptional quietness)
•provide fuel economy as a reason to buy
•are instantly recognizable in look, sound, and feel
•provide exceptional value and quality

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
our one ford global product development process utilizes global platforms to deliver customer-focused programs rapidly and efficiently across global markets. we continue to make progress on our commitment to consolidate platforms.
we now have 12 global platforms, and we are on track to have nine global platforms in 2016, with almost 100% of our global vehicle volume coming off the nine global platforms. we are able to reinvest the savings resulting from of our platform consolidation back into product development to introduce more products at a faster product cadence; our cumulative refresh rate for the 2015 to 2019 period is expected to be the best in the industry. over 50% of our global volume in 2015 will be from vehicles launched in 2014 and 2015. these launches help set up our next stage of growth, and this will drive revenue and profit growth.
we have made substantial progress recently with the quality of our vehicles. our latest "things gone wrong" data shows that our quality is back on track in north america and south america, and is at best-ever levels in europe and asia pacific. areas such as infotainment, transmissions, and interiors have shown significant improvement as a result of focusing our effort to close the gap versus industry averages. we also are working to improve our global product development system to ensure the process improvements we make flow through to more robust launches, less downstream changes, improved timing, and eventually further improve our quality. as a result of these efforts and the migration to our high quality global platforms, customer satisfaction is trending up across all regions.
33
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
drive innovation in every part of our business our third priority is to drive innovation in every part of our business. our industry is rapidly evolving, and new technology is having a significant impact on our business.
we are a technology leader providing innovations consumers demand today while developing affordable, accessible solutions to help meet the needs of future transportation. our approach to innovation is to employ an "innovation mindset"- by asking questions, challenging customs, and taking intelligent risks-all across the company, in every part of the business. innovation is driven by individuals and teams that find new ways to approach existing problems in a quest to make the world a better place.
34
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
we are always looking ahead and developing affordable, accessible solutions to help meet the needs of future transportation. our blueprint for mobility, announced in 2012, set near-, mid- and long-term goals for solutions to the challenges facing mobility systems now and in the future as the world becomes more populated and urbanized. it highlights our thinking about what transportation will look like in 2025 and beyond, and identifies the types of technologies, business models, products, and partnerships needed to get us there.
in the near-term, we are bringing together partners and communities to think beyond the vehicles. we are researching technology and using human ingenuity to locate open parking spaces in crowded cities; make car-sharing easier; move vehicles across cities with remote control; use vehicles and bicycles to gather information about traffic and parking conditions; and even help make health care more accessible in rural areas. in the mid-term, we are targeting additional semi-autonomous driving technologies and the emergence of integrated networks. in the long-term, the landscape could look radically different. connected traffic networks and smart vehicles capable of automated navigation are likely to bring about new business models and contribute to improved personal mobility.
we are advancing the development of semi-autonomous technologies that have the potential to make driving safer, provide a more convenient driving experience, and ease traffic congestion. we are already manufacturing and selling vehicles with driver-assist technologies, such as:
pre-collision assist with pedestrian detection - uses a camera and radar to help reduce the severity of, or even eliminate, some frontal collisions involving vehicles and pedestrians. the pre-collision assist helps drivers avoid frontal collisions with other vehicles at all speeds, while pedestrian detection helps drivers avoid pedestrians at lower speeds.
active park assist - uses ultrasonic sensors and electric power-assisted steering to help drivers parallel park. the sensors measure the gap between two vehicles to determine if there is enough room for the vehicle. after confirming the vehicle can fit, the vehicle automatically steers into the space, while the driver operates the accelerator and brake pedals.
35
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
adaptive cruise control / collision warning with brake support - uses a radar sensor in the front of the vehicle to measure the distance and speed of vehicles ahead. using this information, the vehicle can automatically slow to keep a consistent following distance set by the driver. the slower speed will be maintained if adaptive cruise control is activated. collision warning triggers visual and audio alerts if the system detects the following distance is diminishing too quickly and a collision may occur. it also pre-charges the brakes if the driver needs to stop suddenly.
lane keeping - uses a camera to help prevent the driver from drifting outside of the intended driving lane. the system automatically detects the left- or right- hand road lane markings. an alert, such as a vibration in the steering wheel, is used to warn the driver. the system can also provide steering torque to help guide the vehicle back into the lane if needed.
enhanced active park assist - uses ultrasonic sensors to help the driver reverse into a space side-to-side with other cars, and for ease of parking going into and out of parking spaces.
and we are researching many automated assist technologies, including traffic jam assist, a further building block toward automated driving in the future.

net income includes certain items ("special items") that we have grouped into "personnel and dealer-related items" and "other items" to provide useful information to investors about the nature of the special items. the first category includes items related to our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix and therefore helps investors track amounts related to those activities. the second category includes items that we do not generally consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating activities, and therefore allows investors analyzing our pre-tax results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results.
as detailed in note 24 of the notes to the financial statements, we allocate special items to a separate reconciling item, as opposed to allocating them among the operating segments and other automotive, reflecting the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources among the segments.

not shown in the table above are tax benefits of $494 million, $2.2 billion, and $315 million for 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, that we consider to be special items. for 2013, these included the impact of a favorable increase in deferred tax assets related to investments in our european operations and the release of valuation allowances held against u.s. state and local deferred tax assets.
discussion of automotive sector, financial services sector, and total company results of operations below is on a pre-tax basis and excludes special items unless otherwise specifically noted. references to records by automotive segments-north america, south america, europe, middle east & africa, and asia pacific-are since at least 2000 when we began reporting specific business unit results.
the chart below shows 2014 pre-tax results by sector:
both the automotive and financial services sectors contributed to the company's 2014 pre-tax profit of $6.3 billion. the decline in profit, compared with 2013, was more than explained by automotive sector results.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
automotive sector in general, we measure year-over-year change in automotive pre-tax operating profit for our total automotive sector and reportable segments using the causal factors listed below, with revenue and cost variances calculated at present-year volume and mix and exchange:
•   market factors:
◦   volume and mix - primarily measures profit variance from changes in wholesale volumes (at prior-year average margin per unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the profit variance resulting from changes in product mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line
◦   net pricing - primarily measures profit variance driven by changes in wholesale prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs such as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, and special lease offers
•   contribution costs - primarily measures profit variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume, such as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight and duty costs
•   other costs - primarily measures profit variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. these include mainly structural costs, described below, as well as all other costs, which include items such as litigation costs and costs related to our after-market parts, accessories, and service business. structural costs include the following cost categories:
◦   manufacturing and engineering - consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing- and engineering-related personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), new product launch expense, prototype materials, and outside engineering services
◦   spending-related - consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases
◦   advertising and sales promotions - includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows
◦   administrative and selling - includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities and selling functions, as well as associated information technology costs
◦   pension and opeb - consists primarily of past service pension costs and other postretirement employee benefit costs
•   exchange - primarily measures profit variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to u.s. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging
•   net interest and other
◦   net interest - primarily measures profit variance driven by changes in our automotive sector's centrally-managed net interest, which consists of interest expense, interest income, fair market value adjustments on our cash equivalents and marketable securities portfolio (excluding our investment in mazda), and other adjustments
◦   other - items not included in the causal factors defined above

2014 compared with 2013
total automotive. the following two charts detail the key metrics and the change in 2014 pre-tax results compared with 2013 by causal factor. automotive operating margin is defined as automotive pre-tax results, excluding special items and other automotive, divided by automotive revenue.
as shown above, full-year wholesale volume was about equal to a year ago. automotive sector revenue was lower than a year ago by 3%, more than explained by lower volume from consolidated operations and unfavorable exchange. operating margin, at 3.9%, and pre-tax profit, at $4.5 billion, were also lower.
40
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
lower pre-tax profit was driven by the americas; all other business units improved. higher costs, including warranty, unfavorable exchange, and lower volume, including product launch effects and supplier parts shortages, more than explain the decline. higher net pricing was a partial offset.

north america segment. the following two charts detail the key metrics and the change in 2014 pre-tax results compared with 2013 by causal factor.
north america continued to benefit from robust industry sales, our strong product line-up, continued discipline in matching production to demand, and a lean cost structure.
as shown above, north america's full-year wholesale volume and revenue both declined 5% compared with 2013. operating margin was 8.4%, 1.8 percentage points lower than a year ago, while pre-tax profit was $6.9 billion, down $1.9 billion.
for the full year, total u.s. market share was down 1 percentage point, primarily reflecting lower f-150 share as we prepared for the all-new vehicle by balancing share with transaction prices and stocks, as well as a planned reduction in daily rental sales. u.s. retail share of retail industry was down 0.6 percentage points.

south america segment. the following two charts detail the key metrics and the change in 2014 pre-tax results compared with 2013 by causal factor.
in south america, we are continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our product line-up, including replacing legacy products with global one ford offerings. we also are continuing to manage the effects of slowing gdp growth, lower industry volumes in our larger markets, weaker currencies, high inflation, as well as policy uncertainty in some countries.
as shown above, full-year wholesale volume and revenue deteriorated from a year ago by 14% and 19%, respectively. operating margin was negative 13.2%, and the pre-tax loss was $1.2 billion, both deteriorated from a year ago. the deterioration in all metrics was driven by unfavorable changes in the external factors mentioned above.
45
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the decrease in pre-tax profit for 2014 compared with 2013 is more than explained by unfavorable exchange, higher costs (primarily driven by higher inflation), and lower volume, offset partially by favorable net pricing. the higher net pricing reflects partial recovery of the adverse effects of high local inflation and weaker local currencies, along with pricing associated with our new products. the full year loss includes $426 million of adverse balance sheet exchange effects, related primarily to the devaluation of the venezuela bolivar in the first quarter.

financial services sector as shown in the total company discussion above, we present our financial services sector results in two segments, ford credit and other financial services. ford credit, in turn, has two operations, north america and international.
in general, we measure year-over-year changes in ford credit's pre-tax results using the causal factors listed below:
•   volume:
◦   volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average finance receivables and net investment in operating leases at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin).
◦   volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicle sales and leases, the extent to which ford credit purchases retail installment sale and lease contracts, the extent to which ford credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through ford credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding for the purchase of retail installment sale and lease contracts and to provide wholesale financing.
•financing margin:
◦   financing margin variance is the period-to-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average receivables. financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average receivables for the same period.
◦   financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management.
•   credit loss:
◦   credit loss measures changes in the provision for credit losses. for analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses primarily into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses.
◦   net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of ford credit's present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in economic conditions. for additional information on the allowance for credit losses, refer to the "critical accounting estimates - allowance for credit losses" section below.
•   lease residual:
◦   lease residual measures changes to residual performance. for analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation.
◦   residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to ford credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value of the vehicles sold. changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in ford credit's estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold, and changes in the estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term. for additional information on accumulated supplemental depreciation, refer to the "critical accounting estimates - accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases" section below.
•   other:
◦   primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, and insurance expenses.
◦   changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts.
◦   in general, other revenue changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates), which are included in unallocated risk management, and other miscellaneous items.

2014 compared with 2013
ford credit. the chart below details the change in 2014 pre-tax results compared with 2013 by causal factor.
ford credit is a strategic asset and an integral part of our global growth and value creation strategy. ford credit provides world-class dealer and customer financial services, supported by a strong balance sheet, providing solid profits and distributions to ford.
the improvement of $98 million in pre-tax profit in 2014 compared with 2013 is more than explained by higher volume, driven by increases in consumer and non-consumer finance receivables globally, as well as an increase in operating leases in north america.
partial offsets include unfavorable lease residual performance in north america, resulting from lower relative auction values, and lower financing margin. the lower financing margin primarily reflects a one-time reserve in europe and lower portfolio pricing in north america.

(a)   dealer financing primarily includes wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory.
(b)   at december 31, 2014 and 2013, includes consumer receivables before allowance for credit losses of $24.4 billion and $27.7 billion, respectively, and non-consumer receivables before allowance for credit losses of $21.8 billion and $23.9 billion, respectively, that have been sold for legal purposes in securitization transactions but continue to be reported in ford credit's financial statements. in addition, at december 31, 2014 and 2013, includes net investment in operating leases before allowance for credit losses of $9.6 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively, that have been included in securitization transactions but continue to be reported in ford credit's financial statements. the receivables and net investment in operating leases are available only for payment of the debt issue by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay ford credit's other obligations or the claims of its other creditors. ford credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions. see note 15 of the notes to the financial statements for more information regarding securitization transactions.
managed receivables at december 31, 2014 increased from year-end 2013, driven by increases in consumer and non-consumer finance receivables in all operations and operating leases in north america.

2013 compared with 2012
ford credit. the chart below details the change in 2013 pre-tax results compared with 2012 by causal factor.
the improvement of $59 million is more than explained by higher volume, primarily in north america, driven by an increase in leasing reflecting changes in ford's marketing programs, as well as higher non-consumer finance receivables due to higher dealer stocks.
partial offsets are higher credit losses due to lower credit loss reserve reductions in all operations, and unfavorable residual performance related to lower than expected auction values in north america.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
liquidity and capital resources automotive sector our automotive liquidity strategy includes ensuring that we have sufficient liquidity available with a high degree of certainty throughout the business cycle by generating cash from operations and maintaining access to other sources of funding. we target to have an average ongoing automotive gross cash balance of about $20 billion. we expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to (i) future cash flow expectations such as for pension contributions, debt maturities, capital investments, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic environment. in addition, we also target to maintain a revolving credit facility for our automotive business of about $10 billion to protect against exogenous shocks. our revolving credit facility is discussed below.
we assess the appropriate long-term target for total automotive liquidity, comprised of automotive gross cash and the revolving credit facility, to be about $30 billion, which is an amount we believe is sufficient to support our business priorities and to protect our business. our automotive gross cash and automotive liquidity targets could be reduced over time based on improved operating performance and changes in our risk profile.
for a discussion of risks to our liquidity, see "item 1a. risk factors," as well as note 27 of the notes to the financial statements, regarding commitments and contingencies that could impact our liquidity.
our key liquidity metrics are automotive gross cash, automotive liquidity, and operating-related cash flow (which best represents the ability of our automotive operations to generate cash).
automotive gross cash includes cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, net of any securities-in-transit. automotive gross cash is detailed below as of the dates shown (in billions):

we believe the cash flow analysis reflected in the table below is useful to investors because it includes in operating-related cash flow elements that we consider to be related to our automotive operating activities (e.g., capital spending) and excludes cash flow elements that we do not consider to be related to the ability of our operations to generate cash. this differs from a cash flow statement prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap") and differs from net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable gaap financial measure.

_________
(a)   working capital comprised of changes in receivables, inventory, and trade payables.
(b)   primarily expense and payment timing differences for items such as pension and opeb, compensation, marketing, warranty, and timing differences between unconsolidated affiliate profits and dividends received. also includes other factors, such as the impact of tax payments and vehicle financing activities between automotive and fsg sectors.
(c)   primarily distributions from ford holdings (ford credit's parent) and tax payments received from ford credit.
(d)   2014 includes one-time unfavorable cash effect associated with the accounting change for our operations in venezuela; 2012 includes cash and marketable securities resulting from the consolidation of aai.
(e)   in 2014, we used about $2 billion in cash to settle repurchases of approximately 116 million shares of ford common stock.
with respect to "changes in working capital," in general we carry relatively low automotive sector trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our automotive wholesales are financed (primarily by ford credit) immediately upon sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs at the time the vehicles are gate-released shortly after being produced.  in addition, our inventories are lean because we build to order, not for inventory.  in contrast, our automotive trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms generally ranging between 30 days to 45 days.  as a result, our cash flow tends to improve as wholesale volumes increase, but can deteriorate significantly when wholesale volumes drop sharply. in addition, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow.  for example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and december shutdown periods, when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid.  the net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods.

credit agreement. lenders under our second amended and restated credit agreement dated as of april 30, 2014 (the "revolving credit facility") have commitments to us totaling $12.2 billion, with about $9 billion maturing on april 30, 2019 and about $3 billion maturing on april 30, 2017. we have allocated $2 billion of commitments to ford credit on an irrevocable and exclusive basis to support its liquidity. any borrowings by ford credit under the revolving credit facility would be guaranteed by us.
the revolving credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding. the revolving credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of $4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the revolving credit facility. if our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from fitch, moody's, and s&p (each as defined under "total company" below), the guarantees of certain subsidiaries will be required.
at december 31, 2014, the utilized portion of the revolving credit facility was $58 million, representing amounts utilized as letters of credit.
u.s. department of energy ("doe") advanced technology vehicle manufacturer ("atvm") incentive program.  in september 2009, we entered into a loan arrangement and reimbursement agreement ("arrangement agreement") with the doe, under which we borrowed through multiple draws $5.9 billion to finance certain costs for fuel-efficient, advanced-technology vehicles. at december 31, 2014, an aggregate of $4.4 billion was outstanding. the principal amount of the atvm loan bears interest at a blended rate based on the u.s. treasury yield curve at the time each draw was made (with the weighted-average interest rate on all such draws being about 2.3% per annum). the atvm loan is repayable in equal quarterly installments of $148 million, which began in september 2012 and will end in june 2022.
european investment bank ("eib") loans.  on december 21, 2009, ford romania, our operating subsidiary in romania, entered into a credit facility for an aggregate amount of €400 million (equivalent to $486 million at december 31, 2014) with the eib (the "eib romania facility"), and on july 12, 2010, ford motor company limited, our operating subsidiary in the united kingdom, entered into a credit facility for an aggregate amount of £450 million (equivalent to $701 million at december 31, 2014) with the eib (the "eib united kingdom facility").  the facilities were fully drawn at december 31, 2014. loans under the eib romania facility and the eib united kingdom facility bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.44% and 4% per annum, respectively, and mature on march 31, 2015 and september 11, 2015, respectively.
other automotive credit facilities. at december 31, 2014, we had $822 million of local credit facilities available to non-u.s. automotive affiliates, of which $175 million had been utilized.

net cash. our automotive sector net cash calculation as of the dates shown was as follows (in billions):
december 31, 2014            december 31,2013            december 31,2012
gross cash                             $21.7                       $24.8                       $24.3
less:
long-term debt                          11.3                        14.4                        12.9

total debt                              13.8                        15.7                        14.3
net cash                                $7.9                        $9.1                       $10.0
total debt at december 31, 2014 was $1.9 billion lower than december 31, 2013, primarily reflecting four quarterly installment payments on the atvm loan which totaled about $600 million, the repayment of a $300 million u.s. export-import bank loan, and the conversion into ford common stock of $882 million of outstanding convertible debt, which resulted in a debt reduction of about $800 million.
we expect to reduce automotive debt levels to about $10 billion by 2018. we plan to achieve the debt reduction by 2018 by using cash from operations to make quarterly installment payments on the atvm loan and repay the eib loans and other debt at maturity.
pension plan contributions and strategy. worldwide, our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $9 billion at december 31, 2014, unchanged from december 31, 2013, despite significantly lower discount rates, which were offset by asset returns, contributions, and favorable exchange. the u.s. weighted-average discount rate decreased 80 basis points to 3.94% at year-end 2014 from 4.74% at year-end 2013. the non-u.s. weighted average discount rate decreased 101 basis points to 3.06% at year-end 2014 from 4.07% at year-end 2013. of the $9 billion underfunded status at year-end 2014, $6.5 billion, or about 70%, is associated with our unfunded plans.
our long-term strategy is to reduce the risk of our funded defined benefit pension plans, including minimizing the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension liabilities and the need for unplanned use of capital resources to fund the plans. the strategy reduces balance sheet, cash flow, and income exposures and, in turn, reduces our risk profile. the key elements of this strategy include:
•   limiting liability growth in our defined benefit plans by closing participation to new participants;
•   reducing plan deficits through discretionary cash contributions;
•   progressively re-balancing assets to more fixed income investments, with a target asset allocation to be reached over the next few years of about 80% fixed income investments and 20% growth assets, which will provide a better matching of plan assets to the characteristics of the liabilities, thereby reducing our net exposure; and
•   taking other strategic actions to reduce pension liabilities, such as the voluntary lump sum payout program completed in 2013 for u.s. salaried retirees.
in 2014, we contributed $1.5 billion to our global funded pension plans (most of which were mandatory contributions), a decrease of $3.5 billion compared with 2013, reflecting our improved funded status. during 2015, we expect to contribute $1.1 billion from automotive cash and cash equivalents to our global funded pension plans outside the united states (most of which will be mandatory contributions). we also expect to make about $400 million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans, for a combined total of $1.5 billion. based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major u.s. pension plans in 2015.
asset returns in 2014 for our u.s. plans were 16.4% and 15.7 % for our non-u.s plans, reflecting fixed income gains as interest rates fell, as well as strong growth asset returns. we have continued to progressively increase the mix of fixed income assets in our u.s. plans with the objective of reducing funded status volatility.  the fixed income mix in our u.s. plans at year-end 2014 was 77%, up from 70% at year-end 2013. the u.s. plans were 97% funded at year end 2014. as shown under "critical accounting estimates-pension plans," this strategy has reduced the funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates.
based on present planning assumptions for asset returns, discount rates, and planned cash contributions, we expect our global funded pension obligations to be fully funded by year-end 2016, with variability on a plan-by-plan basis. contributions to our global funded plans in 2016 are expected to be about $1.5 billion, including both required and discretionary contributions. after 2016, we expect contributions to these plans to be limited to ongoing service cost of about $500 million per year.
for a detailed discussion of our pension plans, see note 12 of the notes to the financial statements.

liquidity sufficiency. one of the four key priorities of our one ford plan is to finance our plan and improve our balance sheet, while at the same time having resources available to grow our business. the actions described above are consistent with this priority. based on our planning assumptions, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to continue to invest in new products that customers want and value, transform and grow our business, pay our debts and obligations as and when they come due, pay a sustainable dividend, and provide protection within an uncertain global economic environment.
based on expected cash flows and the identification of additional opportunities for profitable growth, the ongoing amount of capital spending to support product development, growth, restructuring, and infrastructure is expected to increase to about $9 billion annually by 2020. our capital spending was $7.4 billion and $6.6 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and is expected to be about $7.5 billion in 2015.
we will continue to work to strengthen further our balance sheet and improve our investment grade ratings; the amount of incremental capital required to do this will diminish over time as we achieve our target debt levels and fully fund and de-risk our global funded pension plans.
financial services sector ford credit funding strategy. ford credit's primary funding and liquidity objective is to maintain a strong investment grade balance sheet with adequate liquidity to support its financing activities and growth under a variety of market conditions, including short-term and long-term market disruptions.
ford credit's funding strategy remains focused on diversification, and it plans to continue accessing a variety of markets, channels, and investors.
ford credit's liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its business and funding requirements. ford credit regularly stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it continues to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles.
funding sources. ford credit's funding sources include primarily unsecured debt and securitization transactions (including other structured financings). ford credit issues both short-term and long-term debt that is held by both institutional and retail investors, with long-term debt having an original maturity of more than 12 months. ford credit sponsors a number of securitization programs that can be structured to provide both short-term and long-term funding through institutional investors in the united states and international capital markets.
ford credit obtains short-term unsecured funding from the sale of floating rate demand notes under its ford interest advantage program and by issuing unsecured commercial paper in the united states and other international markets. at december 31, 2014, the principal amount outstanding of ford interest advantage notes, which may be redeemed at any time at the option of the holders thereof without restriction, was $5.6 billion. at december 31, 2014, the principal amount outstanding of ford credit's unsecured commercial paper was $1.7 billion, which primarily represents issuance under its commercial paper program in the united states. ford credit maintains multiple sources of readily available liquidity to fund the payment of its unsecured short-term debt obligations.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
funding portfolio. the chart below details the trends in the funding of ford credit's managed receivables:
at year-end 2014, managed receivables were $113 billion, and ford credit ended the year with about $9 billion in cash. securitized funding was 38% of managed receivables, down from 44% at year-end 2013, reflecting a greater mix of unsecured debt.
ford credit is projecting 2015 year-end managed receivables of $123 billion to $128 billion and securitized funding as a percentage of managed receivables in the range of 36% to 38%. ford credit expects this percentage will continue to decline over time.
public term funding plan. the following table shows ford credit's planned issuances for full-year 2015, and its global public term funding issuances in 2014, 2013, and 2012 (in billions), excluding short-term funding programs:

(a)   includes rule 144a offerings.
in 2014, ford credit completed $28 billion of public term funding in the united states, canada, europe, brazil, mexico, and china, including about $13 billion of unsecured debt.
for 2015, ford credit projects full-year public term funding in the range of $25 billion to $31 billion. through february 12, 2015, ford credit has completed $6.3 billion of public term funding in the united states and europe.

at december 31, 2014, ford credit had total liquidity sources of $46.2 billion compared with total liquidity sources of $45.3 billion at december 31, 2013. its liquidity sources of committed capacity and cash are diversified across a variety of markets and platforms. the utilization of its liquidity totaled $18.1 billion at year-end 2014, compared with $22.8 billion at year-end 2013. the decrease of $4.7 billion reflects lower securitization cash and usage of its unsecured credit facilities.
ford credit ended 2014 with gross liquidity of $28.1 billion. after adjustments totaling $1.6 billion, total liquidity available for use continues to remain strong at $26.5 billion at year-end 2014, $5.1 billion higher than year-end 2013.

__________
(a)   includes debt issued in securitization transactions and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. ford credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions.
(b)   excludes marketable securities related to insurance activities.
(c)   primarily related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives due to movements in interest rates. adjustments to debt are related to designated fair value hedges and adjustments to equity are related to retained earnings.
(d)   equals total adjusted debt over total adjusted equity.
ford credit believes that managed leverage is useful to its investors because it reflects the way ford credit manages its business. ford credit deducts cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding marketable securities related to insurance activities) because they generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount required to support its operations and amounts to support on-balance sheet securitization transactions. ford credit makes derivative accounting adjustments to its assets, debt, and equity positions to reflect the impact of interest rate instruments ford credit uses in connection with its term-debt issuances and securitization transactions. the derivative accounting adjustments related to these instruments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market interest rates. ford credit generally repays its debt obligations as they mature. as a result, ford credit excludes the impact of these derivative accounting adjustments on both the numerator and denominator in order to exclude the interim effects of changes in market interest rates.
ford credit plans its managed leverage by considering prevailing market conditions and the risk characteristics of its business. at december 31, 2014, ford credit's managed leverage was 8.7:1, compared with 8.5:1 at december 31, 2013. in 2015, ford credit expects managed leverage to continue in the range of 8:1 to 9:1. in 2014, ford credit paid $395 million in distributions to its parent, ford holdings llc.

total company equity. at december 31, 2014, total equity attributable to ford motor company was $24.8 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion compared with december 31, 2013. the decrease primarily reflects unfavorable changes in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) of $1.8 billion (more than explained by unfavorable pension and opeb adjustments); unfavorable changes in treasury stock of about $300 million related to net stock repurchases and re-issuances; and unfavorable changes in capital in excess of par value of stock of about $300 million related to convertible note debt settlement net of compensation-related equity issuances; offset partially by favorable changes in retained earnings of $1.2 billion related to full-year 2014 net income attributable to ford motor company of $3.2 billion, net of cash dividends declared of $2 billion.
credit ratings. our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations ("nrsros") by the u.s. securities and exchange commission:
•   dbrs limited ("dbrs");
•   fitch, inc. ("fitch");
•   moody's investors service, inc. ("moody's"); and
•   standard &amp; poor's ratings services, a division of mcgraw hill financial ("s&amp;p").
in several markets, locally-recognized rating agencies also rate us. a credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity. rating agencies' ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources. credit ratings assigned to us from all of the nrsros are closely associated with their opinions on ford. credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency.
the following rating actions were taken by these nrsros since september 30, 2014:
•   on october 1, 2014, fitch affirmed its ratings for ford and ford credit, and maintained a positive outlook for both.
•   on october 29, 2014, dbrs affirmed its ratings for ford and ford credit, and maintained a stable outlook for both.
•   on december 16, 2014, moody's affirmed its ratings for ford, and maintained a stable outlook.
•   on january 27, 2015, moody's affirmed its ratings for ford credit, and maintained a stable outlook.

outlook business environment we project global economic growth to be in the 3% range led by the united states and china. global industry sales are expected to grow to between 88 million and 92 million units after estimated sales of 88 million units in 2014. u.s. economic growth is expected to be in the 3% range. consumer sentiment is improving, along with lower fuel prices, which will boost consumer spending, providing support for growth. south america faces continued market volatility and policy uncertainty. a weak recovery is expected in brazil while argentina and venezuela will remain in recession. in europe, growth in the euro area slowed after the first quarter of 2014, but is projected at just above 1% in 2015. growth in the united kingdom is projected to remain in the 2.5% to 3% range. in russia, the combination of lower oil prices, geo-political events, and ruble depreciation will lead to a sharp decline in gross domestic product and higher inflation. in asia pacific, china's economic growth is projected to be in the 7% to 7.5% range; consumer income growth will support an increase in vehicle sales but at a more moderate pace this year. with some encouraging signs of improvement, growth in india is projected to rise above 6% in 2015, supported by a more favorable policy environment. overall, despite challenges in some key markets, we expect the global economy to grow in 2015 and be supportive of our projection for higher global industry volume this year.

(a) compared with 2014
north america we expect north america to be strongly profitable, at a level higher than 2014, with an operating margin of 8% to 9%. this outlook includes higher market share and net pricing, reflecting the impact of launching seven all-new or significantly refreshed products, as well as the effect of the record 16 launches in 2014, many of which occurred late in the year. the f-150 changeover and downtime at our kansas city plant will impact our first quarter 2015 results.
south america in south america, pre-tax results are expected to be substantially improved from 2014, but still be a loss. this outlook reflects the continuation of difficult macroeconomic conditions, with industry volume about equal to 2014. we expect higher market share in 2015 as a result of new product introductions, including the all-new ka. we also expect higher net pricing, in part due to the new products, but also to recover, at least in part, the unfavorable effects of weaker currencies and high local inflation. finally, our south america results will not include the operating results of our venezuela operations, including any impact of currency devaluations.
europe in europe, pre-tax results are expected to improve from 2014, but still be a loss. this outlook reflects higher market share, volume, and net pricing in the europe 20 markets, despite intense competition across the region, as well as weak economic growth in the euro area. this is updated from our september 2014 investor day guidance of a loss of about $250 million, largely due to uncertainty around conditions in russia, as well as higher pension expense in 2015 as a result of even lower discount rates.

middle east & africa middle east & africa is expected to deliver a loss somewhat larger than 2014 as we invest for future growth.
asia pacific in asia pacific, we expect wholesale volume, market share, and pre-tax profit to be higher than 2014 as we continue to introduce new products and bring online new capacity.
net interest expense automotive net interest expense is expected to be equal to or higher than 2014.
ford credit ford credit continues to implement its growth plan and expects pre-tax profit to be equal to or higher than 2014. this outlook reflects year-end managed receivables in the range of $123 billion to $128 billion, managed leverage to continue in the range of 8:1 to 9:1, and distributions of about $250 million.
2015 calendarization effects we expect the calendarization of our total company pre-tax results, excluding special items, to be atypical in 2015. historically, the first half of the year is more profitable for us than the second half. in 2015, however, we expect the reverse to be the case due primarily to the following factors:
•   in north america, the all-new f-150 changeover and downtime at the kansas city plant will affect first quarter results. we also will incur costs and lost volume in the first half of the year related to our seven product launches in 2015, including the edge and explorer. we expect to see the benefit of these launches in the second half of 2015.
•   in asia pacific, we are leveraging our global product portfolio to introduce 18 new vehicles in 2015. this will result in lower first half results as we continue to invest in four new plants that will bring new capacity online for the second half of 2015.

critical accounting estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. in addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.
warranty and field service actions nature of estimates required. we provide warranties on the products we sell. separately, we also periodically perform field service actions related to safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns. pursuant to these warranties and field service actions, we will repair, replace or adjust all parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship.  we accrue the estimated cost of both basic warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale.
assumptions and approach used. we establish estimates for warranty and field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model. we use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year. we reevaluate our estimate of warranty and field service obligations on a regular basis. experience has shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile; therefore, our process relies on long-term historical averages until sufficient data are available. as actual experience becomes available, we use the data to modify the historical averages in order to ensure that the estimate is within the range of likely outcomes. we then compare the resulting accruals with present spending rates to ensure that the balances are adequate to meet expected future obligations. based on these data, we revise our estimates as necessary. warranty coverages vary; therefore, our warranty accruals vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale for specific periods of time and/or mileage. field service actions are distinguishable from warranties in that they may occur in periods beyond the basic warranty coverage period. our best estimate of the obligation related to field service actions includes expected future payments related to vehicles produced in the most recent eight model years and announced field service actions for vehicles produced before this period.
due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. see note 27 of the notes to the financial statements for information regarding warranty and product recall related costs.
pensions and other postretirement employee benefits nature of estimates required. the estimation of our defined benefit pension and opeb plan obligations and expenses requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as demographic experience and health care cost increases. plan obligations and expenses are based on existing retirement plan provisions. no assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts).
assumptions and approach used. the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors:
•   discount rates. our discount rate assumption is based primarily on the results of a cash flow matching analysis, which matches the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield curve based on high-quality bonds specific to the country of the plan. benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve and a single discount rate specific to the plan is determined.
•   expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. our expected long-term rate of return assumption reflects historical returns and long-run inputs from a range of advisors for capital market returns, inflation, bond yields, and other variables, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy such as asset mix. the assumption is based on consideration of all inputs, with a focus on long-term trends to avoid short-term market influences.
•   salary growth. our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience, long-term outlook, and assumed inflation.
•   inflation. our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators, including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation targets.
81
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
•   expected contributions. our expected amount and timing of contributions are based on an assessment of minimum requirements, cash availability, and other considerations (e.g., funded status, avoidance of regulatory premiums and levies, and tax efficiency).
•   retirement rates. retirement rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience.
•   mortality rates. mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience.
•   health care cost trends. our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends.
assumptions are set at each year end and are generally not changed during the year unless there is a major plan event such as a significant curtailment or settlement that would trigger a plan remeasurement.
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are recorded as unamortized net gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) on our balance sheet. unamortized gains and losses are amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in future periods.
mortality assumptions. as part of the normal management of our defined benefit pension and opeb plans, we consistently review our demographic assumptions and actual experience, including our assumptions for mortality. at year-end 2014, we updated our assumptions for future mortality improvements in our north american defined benefit pension and opeb plans, taking into consideration recent mortality information published by recognized experts in this field, primarily the u.s. society of actuaries and the canadian institute of actuaries. this information was considered, along with the characteristics of our plan-specific populations and other data where appropriate, in developing our best estimate of the expected mortality of plan participants. the impact of this update on our global pension and opeb obligations was not significant and is included in the benefit obligations shown in note 12 of the notes to the financial statements.
see note 12 of the notes to the financial statements for more information regarding pension and opeb costs and assumptions.
pension plans effect of actual results. the year-end 2014 weighted average discount rate was 3.94% for u.s. plans and 3.06% for non-u.s. plans, reflecting decreases of 80 and 101 basis points, respectively, compared with year-end 2013. in 2014, the u.s. actual return on assets was 16.4%, which was higher than the expected long-term rate of return of 6.89%. non-u.s. actual return on assets was 15.7%, which was higher than the expected long-term rate of return of 6.63%. in total, these differences resulted in a net increase in unamortized losses of about $3 billion which are expected to be recognized as a component of net expense over the expected future years of service (approximately 10 years for our major u.s. plans and 11 years for our major non-u.s. plans).
for 2015, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is 6.75% for u.s. plans and 6.11% for non-u.s. plans, down 14 basis points and 52 basis points, respectively, compared with a year ago, reflecting primarily a higher fixed income allocation.
worldwide pension expense, excluding special items, was $1 billion in 2014, $600 million lower than 2013, driven primarily by higher discount rates at year-end 2013 compared with 2012. based on year-end assumptions, we expect 2015 pension expense to be higher compared with 2014, reflecting primarily lower discount rates at year-end 2014 compared with 2013.
de-risking strategy. in 2012, we adopted a broad global de-risking strategy which increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation as funded status improves. changes in interest rates (which directly influence changes in discount rates), in addition to other factors, have a significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio. as we de-risk our plans and increase the allocation to fixed income investments over time, we expect the funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates will be significantly reduced. any change in interest rates should result in offsetting effects in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio.
sensitivity analysis. the december 31, 2014 pension funded status and 2015 expense are affected by year-end 2014 assumptions. sensitivities to these assumptions may be asymmetric and are specific to the time periods noted. the effects of changes in the factors which generally have the largest impact on year-end funded status and pension expense are discussed below.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
discount rates and interest rates have the largest impact on our net funded status. the table below estimates the impact as of december 31, 2014 on our funded status of an increase/decrease in discount rates and interest rates (in millions):

the fixed income asset sensitivity shown excludes other fixed income return components (e.g., bond coupon and active management excess returns), growth asset returns and changes in value of related insurance contracts. other factors that impact net funded status (e.g., contributions) are not reflected.
discount rates and the expected long-term rate of return on assets have the largest impact on pension expense. these assumptions are generally set at each year end for expense recorded throughout the following year. the table below estimates the impact on 2015 pension expense of a higher/lower assumption for these factors (in millions):
basis         increase/(decrease) in point         2015 expense factor                                        change        u.s. plans             non-u.s. plans discount rate                                 +/- 10 bps.   $(35)/40               $(40)/40
expected long-term rate of return on assets   +/- 10        (40)/40                (20)/20
the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities. the sensitivity of pension expense to an increase in discount rates assumptions may not be linear.
other postretirement employee benefits effect of actual results. the weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for u.s. opeb plans at december 31, 2014 was 3.86%, compared with 4.65% at december 31, 2013, resulting in an unamortized loss of about $400 million. this amount is expected to be recognized as a component of net expense over the expected future years of service (approximately 12 years).
sensitivity analysis. the effect on u.s. and canadian plans of a 100 basis point increase/(decrease) in the assumed discount rate would have resulted in a (lower)/higher postretirement benefit expense for 2015 of approximately $(40) million/$40 million, and in the year-end 2014 obligation of approximately $(720) million/$850 million.
income taxes nature of estimates required. we must make estimates and apply judgment in determining the provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes. we make these estimates and judgments primarily in the following areas: (i) the calculation of tax credits, (ii) the calculation of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes that will ultimately be reported in tax returns, as well as (iii) the calculation of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. changes in these estimates and judgments may result in a material increase or decrease to our tax provision, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs.
assumptions and approach used. we are subject to the income tax laws and regulations of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. these tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and circumstances that may be open to interpretation. we recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws, regulations, and various related judicial opinions. if, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably to us, we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized. this process is inherently subjective, since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcomes. we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis, including consideration of changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. changes to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income taxes during the period in which the change occurred.
83
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
we must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income. gaap requires a reduction of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.
we presently believe that a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion is required, primarily for deferred tax assets related to our south america operations. we believe that we ultimately will recover the remaining $13.1 billion of deferred tax assets. we have assessed recoverability of these assets, and concluded that no valuation allowance is required.
for additional information regarding income taxes, see note 21 of the notes to the financial statements.
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents ford credit's estimate of the probable credit loss inherent in finance receivables and operating leases as of the balance sheet date. the adequacy of ford credit's allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly. because credit losses can vary substantially over time, estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain. see note 7 of the notes to the financial statements for more information regarding allowance for credit losses.
nature of estimates required. ford credit estimates the probable credit losses inherent in finance receivables and operating leases based on several factors.
consumer portfolio. ford credit estimates the allowance for credit losses on consumer receivables and on operating leases using a combination of measurement models and management judgment. the models consider factors such as historical trends in credit losses and recoveries (including key metrics such as delinquencies, repossessions, and bankruptcies), the composition of ford credit's present portfolio (including vehicle brand, term, risk evaluation, and new/used vehicles), trends in historical used vehicle values, and economic conditions. estimates from these models rely on historical information and may not fully reflect losses inherent in the present portfolio. therefore, ford credit may adjust the estimate to reflect management judgment regarding observable changes in recent economic trends and conditions, portfolio composition, and other relevant factors.
assumptions used. ford credit's allowance for credit losses is based on assumptions regarding:
•   frequency. the number of finance receivables and operating lease contracts that are expected to default over the loss emergence period, measured as repossessions; and
•   loss severity. the expected difference between the amount a customer owes when the finance contract is charged off and the amount received, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer.
collective allowance for credit losses. the collective allowance is evaluated primarily using a collective loss-to receivables ("ltr") model that, based on historical experience, indicates credit losses have been incurred in the portfolio even though the particular accounts that are uncollectible cannot be specifically identified. the ltr model is based on the most recent years of history. each ltr is calculated by dividing credit losses by average end-of-period finance receivables or average end-of-period operating leases, excluding unearned interest supplements and allowance for credit losses. an average ltr is calculated for each product and multiplied by the end-of-period balances for that given product.
ford credit's largest markets also use a loss projection model to estimate losses inherent in the portfolio. the loss projection model applies recent monthly performance metrics, stratified by contract type (retail or lease), contract term (e.g., 60-month), and risk rating to ford credit's active portfolio to estimate the losses that have been incurred.
the loss emergence period ("lep") is a key assumption within ford credit's models and represents the average amount of time between when a loss event first occurs to when it is charged off. this time period starts when the consumer begins to experience financial difficulty. it is evidenced, typically through delinquency, before eventually resulting in a charge-off. the lep is a multiplier in the calculation of the collective consumer allowance for credit losses.
for accounts greater than 120 days past due, the uncollectible portion is charged off, such that the remaining recorded investment is equal to the estimated fair value of the collateral less costs to sell.
84
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
specific allowance for impaired receivables. consumer receivables involved in troubled debt restructurings are specifically assessed for impairment. a specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flows of the receivable discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate or the fair value of any collateral adjusted for estimated costs to sell.
after establishing the allowance for credit losses, if ford credit management believes the allowance does not reflect all losses inherent in the portfolio due to changes in recent economic trends and conditions, or other relevant factors, an adjustment is made based on management judgment.
sensitivity analysis. changes in the assumptions used to derive frequency and severity would affect the allowance for credit losses. the effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for ford credit's u.s. ford and lincoln brand retail financing and operating lease portfolio is as follows (in millions, except for percentages):
increase/(decrease)

__________
(a)   reflects the number of finance receivables and operating lease contracts that ford credit expects will default over a period of time relative to the average number of contracts outstanding.
non-consumer portfolio. ford credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for non-consumer receivables based on historical ltr ratios, expected future cash flows, and the fair value of collateral.
collective allowance for credit losses. ford credit estimates an allowance for non-consumer receivables that are not specifically identified as impaired using a ltr model for each financing product based on historical experience. this ltr is an average of the most recent historical experience and is calculated consistent with the consumer receivables ltr approach. all accounts that are specifically identified as impaired are excluded from the calculation of the non-specific or collective allowance.
specific allowance for impaired receivables. dealer financing is evaluated by segmenting individual loans by the risk characteristics of the loan (such as the amount of the loan, the nature of the collateral, and the financial status of the debtor). the loans are analyzed to determine whether individual loans are impaired, and a specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flows of the receivable discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral adjusted for estimated costs to sell.
after establishing the allowance for credit losses, if ford credit management believes the allowance does not reflect all losses inherent in the portfolio due to changes in recent economic trends and conditions, or other relevant factors, an adjustment is made based on management judgment.
changes in ford credit's assumptions affect the provision for credit losses and insurance losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit losses contained within finance receivables, net and net investment in operating leases on our balance sheet, in each case under the financial services sector.
accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in ford credit's operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term.
ford credit monitors residual values each month, and it reviews the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. if ford credit believes that the expected residual values for its vehicles have changed, it revises depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating leases (equal to the acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be adjusted to reflect ford credit's revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. such adjustments to depreciation expense would result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases and are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis.
each lease customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer.

nature of estimates required.  each operating lease in ford credit's portfolio represents a vehicle it owns that has been leased to a customer. at the time ford credit purchases a lease, it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle. ford credit estimates the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction values, return volumes for its leased vehicles, industrywide used vehicle prices, marketing incentive plans, and vehicle quality data.
assumptions used. ford credit's accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on assumptions regarding:
•   auction value. ford credit's projection of the market value of the vehicles when sold at the end of the lease; and
•   return volume. ford credit's projection of the number of vehicles that will be returned at lease-end.
see note 6 of the notes to the financial statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases.
sensitivity analysis. for returned vehicles, ford credit faces a risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than its estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle. the effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for ford credit's u.s. ford and lincoln brand operating lease portfolio is as follows (in millions, except for percentages):

the impact of the increased accumulated supplemental depreciation in 2014 would be charged to expense in the
2015 - 2018 periods. adjustments to the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases would be reflected on our balance sheet as net investment in operating leases and on the income statement in depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases, in each case under the financial services sector.

aggregate contractual obligations we are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. most of these are debt obligations incurred by our financial services sector. long-term debt may have fixed or variable interest rates. for long-term debt with variable-rate interest, we estimate the future interest payments based on projected market interest rates for various floating-rate benchmarks received from third parties. in addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components, and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. these arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. "purchase obligations" are defined as off-balance sheet agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms.
the table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2014 (in millions):

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural, consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions, applications and market-leading products. we operate in three distinct business segments: fmc agricultural solutions, fmc health and nutrition and fmc minerals. our fmc agricultural solutions segment develops, markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals - insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. these products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects, weeds and disease, as well as in non-agricultural markets for pest control. the fmc health and nutrition segment focuses on food, pharmaceutical ingredients, nutraceuticals, personal care and similar markets. our food ingredients are used to enhance texture, color, structure and physical stability. the pharmaceutical additives are used for binding, encapsulation and disintegrant applications. some of our products are increasingly being used as an active ingredients in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical markets. our fmc minerals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials, including soda ash and lithium. soda ash is utilized in markets such as glass and detergents and lithium is utilized in energy storage, specialty polymers and pharmaceutical synthesis.
2014 highlights the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during the year ended december 31, 2014:
•   revenue of $4,037.7 million in 2014 increased $162.9 million or four percent versus last year. revenue increases are associated with sales growth in all segments. a more detailed review of revenues by segment are included under the section entitled "results of operations". on a regional basis, sales in latin america decreased by four percent, sales in north america were up seven percent, sales in asia were up 14 percent and sales in europe, middle east and africa (emea) increased by six percent.
•   our gross margin, excluding acquisition/divestiture related charges, of $1,379.2 million increased approximately $34 million or approximately two percent versus last year. gross margin as a percent of revenues of approximately 34 percent declined one hundred basis points compared to 2013. the increase in gross margin did not result in increased gross margin percent primarily due to unfavorable currency movements and product mix of sales in fmc agricultural solutions.
•   selling, general and administrative expenses increased 20 percent from $515.8 million to $621.2 million. selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding non-operating pension and postretirement charges and acquisition/divestiture related charges, of $469.9 million decreased $3.0 million or approximately one percent. non-operating pension and postretirement charges and acquisition/divestiture related charges are presented in our adjusted earnings non-gaap financial measurement below under the section titled "results of operations".
•   research and development expenses of $128.3 million increased $10.6 million or nine percent, largely due to spending in fmc agricultural solutions to fund investments in earlier stage active ingredient research, biological crop protection development projects and rapid market innovation initiatives.
•   adjusted earnings after-tax from continuing operations attributable to fmc stockholders of $541.1 million increased approximately $12.7 million or two percent. see the disclosure of our adjusted earnings non-gaap financial measurement below under the section titled "results of operations".

other 2014 highlights
◦   on september 8, 2014, we announced that we will no longer proceed with the planned separation of fmc into two distinct public entities. at that time we announced the acquisition of cheminova and divestiture of our fmc alkali chemicals division.
◦   in october 2014 we purchased the remaining 6.25 percent ownership interest from the last remaining non-controlling interest holder in a legal entity within our fmc alkali chemicals division, which increased our ownership from 93.75 percent to 100 percent. we paid $95.7 million to the minority shareholder in 2014.
◦   also in october 2014, we entered into a $2.0 billion term loan facility for the purposes of funding the acquisition of cheminova and amended our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility in conjunction with the term loan facility.
2015
◦   during the first part of this year, we expect to close on two significant transactions - the divestiture of our alkali chemicals division and the acquisition of cheminova - that will shape fmc into a stronger, focused company serving agriculture, health and nutrition end markets.
◦   the integration of cheminova into fmc agricultural solutions is an integral part of fmc's strategy to become a more focused and global agriculture, health and nutrition company with strong competitive positions in fast-growing markets. our combined company will have broader market access in europe, latin america and key asia-pacific markets such as india and australia.
◦   on february 5, 2015 we signed a definitive agreement to sell our fmc alkali chemicals division to tronox limited. we expect the sale to be completed in early 2015 subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. the proceeds from the sale will be used to fund the acquisition of cheminova and allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility.
◦   subsequent to the sale of our fmc alkali chemicals division, our fmc lithium division will become a standalone reporting segment. we intend to make investments that will allow the business to take advantage of strong underlying growth potential and leading positions in a well-structured industry.

____________________
(1)   see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10-k for details of restructuring and other charges (income). amounts for the years ended 2014, 2013 and 2012 relate to fmc agricultural solutions of $(4.5) million, $32.6 million and $8.5 million; fmc health and nutrition of $14.1 million, $1.0 million and $0.7 million; fmc minerals of $0.1 million, $6.4 million and $13.0 million; and corporate of $46.8 million, $7.9 million and $5.3 million, respectively.
(2)   our non-operating pension and postretirement costs are defined as those costs related to interest, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements. these costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and we consider these costs to be outside our operational performance. we exclude these non-operating pension and postretirement costs from our segments as we believe that removing them provides a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our businesses, provides increased transparency and clarity in the performance of our retirement plans and enhances period-over-period comparability. we continue to include the service cost and amortization of prior service cost in our operating segments noted above. we believe these elements reflect the current year operating costs to our businesses for the employment benefits provided to active employees.
(3)   charges are associated with the previously planned separation of our fmc corporation into two independent public companies. on september 8, 2014, we announced that we would no longer proceed with the planned separation of fmc into two distinct public entities. at that time we announced the acquisition of cheminova; see note 3 within these consolidated financial statements included within this form 10-k for more information. these charges are included within "business separation costs" on our consolidated income statement. these costs were primarily related to professional fees associated with separation activities within the finance and legal functions through september 8, 2014.

(4)   charges related to the expensing of the inventory fair value step-up resulting from the application of acquisition purchase accounting, legal and professional fees and gains or losses on hedging purchase price associated with the planned or completed acquisitions and costs incurred associated with the divestiture of our fmc alkali chemicals division. amounts represent the following:

adjusted earnings reconciliation the following chart, which is provided to assist the readers of our financial statements, depicts certain charges (gains) that are excluded by us in the measures we use to evaluate business performance and determine certain performance-based compensation. these items are discussed in detail within the section that follows. additionally, the chart below discloses our non-gaap financial measure "adjusted after-tax earnings from continuing operations attributable to fmc stockholders" reconciled from the gaap financial measure "net income attributable to fmc stockholders". we believe that this measure provides useful information about our operating results to investors and securities analysts. we also believe that excluding the effect of "corporate special charges (income)" from operating results and discontinued operations allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period. "corporate special charges (income)" are defined as: restructuring and other income and charges, non-operating pension and postretirement charges, acquisition/divestiture related charges, business separation charges as well as certain tax adjustments, this measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with gaap.

revenue               $2,173.8                $2,145.7                $1,763.8

2014 vs. 2013
revenue of $2,173.8 million increased approximately one percent versus the prior year period due to higher sales in north america, asia and emea offset by a decline in sales in latin america.
sales in latin america of $1,120.7 million decreased five percent due to weak demand conditions in brazil, particularly in sugarcane and cotton segments, as drought and lower planted area reduced herbicide and insecticide demand.  this was partially offset by growth in other latin american countries such as argentina and mexico as fmc gained market share. sales in north america of $560.2 million increased 11 percent primarily driven by strong demand for pre-emergent herbicides into soybeans and growth from new product introductions into various crop segments. revenue in asia of $343.6 million increased nine percent reflecting sales growth in australia, pakistan, korea and china. sales in europe, middle east and africa (emea) increased seven percent to $149.3 million primarily due to higher herbicide volumes.
fmc agricultural solutions' operating profit of $497.8 million decreased approximately eight percent compared to the year-ago period, reflecting relatively flat sales, unfavorable currency impacts, increases to sg&a as well as additional planned r&d investments and changes in product mix. sg&a costs were approximately $2 million higher and r&d costs were approximately $12 million higher than the prior year period with spending on marketing, sales and technology investments.
in 2015, we expect that earnings contributions from the cheminova acquisition, the continued spread of weed resistance in north and latin america, and market share gains in asia and emea will drive full-year segment earnings 15 to 30 percent higher than 2014.
2013 vs. 2012
revenue of $2,145.7 million increased approximately 22 percent versus the prior year period due to sales growth in north america, latin america and asia, partially offset by declines in emea.
sales in latin america of $1,184.7 million increased 23 percent driven by brazil volume growth in herbicide and insecticide sales for soybeans, including growth from new and recently launched products. sales in north america of $506.1 million increased 37 percent driven by strong demand for pre-emergent herbicides and at-plant insecticides as well as growth from new product introductions. revenue in asia of $315.4 million increased 14 percent reflecting sales growth in china, indonesia, australia and a number of other key countries. emea declined 12 percent to $139.5 million primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and lower insecticide sales.
fmc agricultural solutions' operating profit of $539.0 million increased approximately 19 percent compared to the year-ago period, reflecting the sales growth described in the preceding paragraph, a favorable geographic mix and selected price increases. selling, general and administrative costs were approximately $9 million or three percent higher compared to the prior year due to increased spending on growth initiatives and higher people-related costs to support the higher sales. research and development costs also increased period over period by approximately $5 million due to increased spending associated with various innovation projects.
certain regulatory issues we intend to defend vigorously all our products in the u.s., eu and other countries as our pesticide products are reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2015 as part of the ongoing cycle of re-registration of our pesticide products around the world.

operating profit       187.9                 169.5                 161.6
2014 vs. 2013
revenue was $828.2 million, an increase of approximately nine percent versus the prior-year period. revenue from higher volumes in health markets, including acquisitions completed in 2013, and higher volumes in overall nutrition markets increased sales by approximately six percent and two percent, respectively. favorable pricing and mix, primarily in nutrition-related products increased sales by one percent.
segment operating profit of $187.9 million increased by 11 percent versus the prior-year period driven by higher demand for pharmaceutical excipients and texture and stability products in north america. these were slightly offset by increased raw material costs, particularly seaweed, and reduced demand for nutrition products into the chinese beverage market.
for 2015, full-year segment earnings are expected to increase by mid-single digit percent. earnings growth is expected to come from moderate demand recovery in the chinese beverage market, continued demand for pharmaceutical products, particularly excipients, and benefits from operational improvements.
2013 vs. 2012
revenue was $762.0 million, an increase of approximately 12 percent versus the prior-year period. this increase was due to volume increases of three percent in core product lines, revenue from acquisitions which increased sales by six percent, favorable pricing and foreign currency impacts which increased sales by two and one percent, respectively.
segment operating profit of $169.5 million increased by five percent versus the prior year period as revenue growth was partially offset by acquisition integration costs, higher raw material costs and costs associated with our manufacturing excellence program. selling, general and administrative costs also increased approximately $6 million compared to the prior year due to the addition of the epax business within the segment.

operating profit         166.7                 128.3                 171.4
2014 vs. 2013
revenue of $1,035.7 million increased by seven percent over the prior year. volume gains in alkali and lithium along with improvements in soda ash pricing contributed to the higher revenue.
alkali revenues of $779.0 million increased four percent over the prior year. higher average prices and volume increases each contributed a 2 percent increase in revenue, respectively. the most notable price increases were realized in asian export markets.
lithium revenues of $256.7 million increased 15 percent compared to the prior year. higher production volume that allowed for additional sales, particularly for energy storage applications contributed a 19 percent increase in revenue, partially offset by lower pricing which negatively impacted revenues by four percent.
segment operating profit of $166.7 million increased approximately 30 percent versus the prior year. operating profit was driven by higher volumes, improved pricing and lower operating costs in alkali as well as higher volumes in lithium . these increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency and operating costs associated with lithium's argentine operations and higher energy costs in alkali.
for 2015, reported segment earnings, which will include only our fmc lithium business, are expected to be within the range of $15 to $25 million. we anticipate higher prices for both lithium hydroxide and carbonate driven by increased
28
demand for energy storage applications will be offset by reduced sourcing of lithium carbonate from third parties and higher operating costs in argentina.
2013 vs. 2012
revenue of $970.0 million, was essentially flat period over period. volume gains of three percent driven by alkali sales were offset by unfavorable pricing year over year. unfavorable pricing was primarily driven by alkali, slightly offset by favorable pricing in lithium.
alkali revenues of $747.0 million increased two percent over the prior year due to volume gains of six percent which were partially offset by reduced pricing of four percent.
lithium revenues of $223.0 million decreased four percent compared to the prior year due to unfavorable sales mix. production and sales volumes on a lithium carbonate equivalent basis were relatively flat year over year, as lower production in argentina due to operational issues was offset by higher third party product purchases.
segment operating profit of $128.3 million decreased approximately 25 percent versus the prior year. the decrease was primarily due to lower average export pricing in soda ash. additionally, production factors, such as poor geological conditions at the alkali mine as well as poor weather at the lithium mine and unfavorable currency in lithium impacted the results.
corporate and other corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item "selling, general and administrative expenses" except for last in, first-out (lifo) related charges that are included as a component of "cost of sales and other services" on our consolidated statements of income.
2014 vs. 2013
corporate and other expenses of $72.3 million decreased by $10.4 million from $82.7 million in the same period in 2013. the decrease period over period is primarily due to a decrease of $5.1 million in employees' incentive accruals and a decrease of $4.6 million in pension service charges. reduced pension service charges are primarily driven by the higher discount rate utilized to calculate the 2014 expense.
2013 vs. 2012
corporate and other expenses of $82.7 million increased by $4.1 million from $78.6 million in the same period in 2012. the increase period over period is due to increased costs of approximately $4 million primarily representing costs associated with the transformation of our finance organization. this transformation is similar to past initiatives to improve our organization.
interest expense, net
2014 vs. 2013
interest expense, net for 2014 of $59.5 million increased approximately 41% percent as compared to 2013 of $42.2 million. the increase is primarily driven by the issuance of $400 million in senior notes in november 2013. the $400 million debt issuance, with an interest rate of 4.10 percent, was utilized to fund the acquisition of epax and to fund working capital requirements of our businesses.
2013 vs. 2012
interest expense, net for 2013 of $42.2 million increased approximately four percent compared to 2012 of $40.7 million. the increase was primarily due to higher overall debt levels driven by funding requirements for the acquisition of epax and our share repurchases during 2013.

total restructuring and other charges         $56.5               $47.9               $27.5
2014
restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2014 of $17.3 million were primarily associated with our health and nutrition restructuring as well as other miscellaneous exit costs. other charges (income) net in 2014 of $39.2 million were primarily related to corporate environmental charges of $43.7 million and charges of $22.1 million associated with our fmc agricultural solutions segment which entered into collaboration and license agreements with various third-party companies for the purpose of obtaining certain technology and intellectual property rights relating to new compounds still under development. offsetting these charges is income from the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in a pesticide distribution company which resulted in a gain on the sale of approximately $26.6 million.
2013
restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2013 of $9.6 million were primarily associated with the announced lithium restructuring. other charges (income) net in 2013 of $38.3 million primarily related to charges associated with collaboration and license agreements entered into by our fmc agricultural solutions segment for the purpose of obtaining certain technology and intellectual property rights relating to new compounds still under development. the rights and technology obtained is referred to as in-process research and development and in accordance with gaap, the amounts paid were expensed as incurred since they were acquired outside of a business combination.
2012
restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2012 primarily included charges of $13.3 million associated with the lithium restructuring. other charges (income) net in 2012 were primarily due to charges of $5.8 million for environmental remediation at operating sites and a $4.4 million charge related to our fmc agricultural solutions segment for the purpose of acquiring certain rights to a fungicide still under development.
the activity of the restructuring charges listed above are also included within note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k. we believe the restructuring plans implemented are on schedule and the benefits and savings either have been or will be achieved.
non-operating pension and postretirement (charges) income non-operating pension and postretirement (charges) income are included in "selling, general and administrative expenses" on our consolidated statements of income.
2014 vs. 2013
the charge for 2014 was $10.5 million compared to $38.1 million for 2013. the decrease in charges was primarily attributable to lower amortization of net actuarial losses of $21.1 million compared to 2013.
2013 vs. 2012
the charge for 2013 was $38.1 million compared to $34.9 million for 2012. the increase in charges were primarily the result of a settlement charge of $7.4 million, partially offset by lower interest costs of $3.7 million. the settlement charge was associated with the acceleration of previously deferred actuarial losses triggered by the lump-sum payout to former executives in 2013.
business separation costs on september 8, 2014, we announced that we would no longer proceed with the planned separation of fmc into two distinct public entities. at that time we announced the acquisition of cheminova and divestiture of our fmc alkali chemicals division.

_______________
(1) tax adjustments in 2014 were primarily associated with revisions to our tax liabilities associated with prior year tax matters. tax adjustments in 2013 were primarily associated with adjustments to u.s. state deferred tax balances established prior to 2013 driven by a change in enacted tax rates and other state related items. tax adjustments in 2012
were primarily driven by a reduction in our valuation allowance related to state net operating losses expected to be recoverable in future years.
the primary drivers for the fluctuations in the effective effective tax rate from 2012 to 2014 are provided in the table above. excluding the items in the table above, the decrease in the effective tax rates from 2012 to 2014 was primarily due to a shift in earnings mix as it relates to domestic versus foreign income. foreign profits are generally taxed at lower rates compared to domestic income. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the provisions for income taxes on continuing operations, as well as items that significantly impact our effective tax rate.
discontinued operations, net of income taxes our discontinued operations represent our discontinued fmc peroxygens segment results as well as adjustments to retained liabilities from previous discontinued operations. the primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities, other postretirement benefit liabilities, self-insurance, long-term obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities.
2014 vs 2013
discontinued operations, net of income taxes represented a loss of $89.4 million for december 31, 2014, compared to a loss of $159.3 million for 2013. the loss in 2014 was driven by provisions for environmental liabilities of $36.7 million and legal reserves of $14.3 million and the final divestiture charge on the sale of our fmc peroxygens business of $34.4 million. the loss in 2014 was less than the loss in 2013 due to the charge of $156.7 million ($122.1 million after-tax) in 2013 associated with our discontinued fmc peroxygens segment. a large portion of the 2013 charge was associated with a write down of the fmc peroxygens segment assets held for sale to fair value. see note 9 within our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for more information.
2013 vs. 2012
discontinued operations, net of income taxes totaled a charge of $159.3 million for 2013, compared to a charge of $27.5 million 2013. the increase was a result of a charge of $156.7 million ($122.1 million after-tax) associated with our discontinued fmc peroxygens segment. the charge was primarily associated with a write down of the fmc peroxygens segment assets held for sale to fair value.
net income attributable to fmc stockholders
2014 vs 2013
net income attributable to fmc stockholders increased to $307.5 million in 2014, from $293.9 million in 2013. the increase was driven by improvements in fmc health and nutrition and fmc minerals segment operating profits, lower effective tax rate, lower non-operating pension and postretirement charges and reduced charges associated with discontinued operations. mostly offsetting these improvements were costs associated with our previously planned
31
business separation, the acquisition of cheminova, the divestiture of our fmc alkali chemicals division, lower fmc agricultural solutions segment earnings and higher interest expense.
2013 vs. 2012
net income attributable to fmc stockholders decreased to $293.9 million in 2013, from $416.2 million in 2012. this fluctuation year over year is described in more detail above, however the primary driver is the $122.1 million after-tax charge associated with our discontinued fmc peroxygens business.
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2014 and 2013, were $109.5 million and $123.2 million, respectively. of the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31, 2014, $84.8 million were held by our foreign subsidiaries. our intent is to reinvest permanently the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore we have not recorded taxes that would be payable if we repatriated these earnings.
term loan facility on october 10, 2014, we entered into a term loan agreement (the "term loan agreement"), that provides for a senior unsecured term loan facility of up to $2 billion (the "term loan facility") to consummate the acquisition of cheminova (the "acquisition"). the term loan facility is a senior unsecured obligation that ranks equally with our other senior unsecured obligations. the proceeds of the loans to be made pursuant to the term loan facility will be available in one or more drawings on the closing date of the term loan facility, which will be substantially concurrent with the closing of the acquisition. the scheduled maturity of the term loan facility is on the fifth anniversary of this closing date. the proceeds will be used to finance the acquisition as well as to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by or related to the acquisition or the term loan facility.
loans under the term loan agreement will bear interest at a floating rate, which will be a base rate or a eurocurrency rate equal to the london interbank offered rate for the relevant interest period, plus in each case an applicable margin, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the term loan agreement. the base rate will be the highest of: the rate of interest announced publicly by citibank, n.a. in new york, new york from time to time as its "base rate"; the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1 percent; and the eurocurrency rate for a one-month period plus 1 percent.
we are required to pay a commitment fee on the average daily unused amount from october 10, 2014 until the date on which all commitments are terminated, payable quarterly, at a rate per annum equal to an applicable percentage in effect from time to time for commitment fees. the initial commitment fee is 0.125 percent per annum. the applicable margin and the commitment fee are subject to adjustment as provided in the term loan agreement.
the term loan agreement contains financial and other covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio. fees incurred to secure the term loan facility have been deferred and will be amortized over the term of the arrangement.
revolving credit facility on october 10, 2014 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the "revolving credit agreement"). the unsecured revolving credit agreement provides for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, with an option, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to increase the aggregate amount of the revolving credit commitments to $2.25 billion (the "revolving credit facility"). the current termination date of the revolving credit facility is october 10, 2019.
revolving loans under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at a floating rate, which will be a base rate or a eurocurrency rate equal to the london interbank offered rate for the relevant interest period, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the revolving credit agreement. the base rate will be the highest of: the rate of interest announced publicly by citibank, n.a. in new york, new york from time to time as its "base rate"; the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1 percent; and the eurocurrency rate for a one-month period plus 1 percent. we are also required to pay a facility fee on the average daily amount (whether used or unused) at a rate per annum equal to an applicable percentage in effect from time to time for the facility fee, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the revolving credit agreement. the initial facility fee is 0.125 percent per annum. the applicable margin and the facility fee are subject to adjustment as provided in the revolving credit agreement.
the revolving credit agreement contains customary financial and other covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio. the financial covenant levels have been amended in order to permit the debt incurred under the contemplated term loan facility discussed above along with certain other changes to permit the acquisition and the divestiture of our fmc alkali chemicals division.

at december 31, 2014, we had total debt of $1,678.6 million as compared to $1,851.9 million at december 31, 2013. this included $1,153.4 million and $1,154.1 million of long-term debt (excluding current portions of $2.0 million and $34.7 million) at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. our short-term debt, consists of foreign borrowings and our commercial paper program. foreign borrowings increased from $7.1 million at december 31, 2013 to $36.6 million at december 31, 2014 while outstanding commercial paper decreased from $656.0 million to $486.6 million at december 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively. our commercial paper program allows us to borrow at rates generally more favorable than those available under our credit facility. at december 31, 2014, the average effective interest rate on these borrowings was 0.48%.
statement of cash flows cash provided by operating activities was $418.9 million, $378.8 million and $422.3 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

____________________
(1)   represents the sum of depreciation, amortization, non-cash asset write down, share-based compensation and pension charges.
(2)   overall, the increase in trade receivables in each period is driven by revenue increases in all three of our segments as well as due to timing of payments. trade receivable increases are primarily driven by sales in brazil from our fmc agricultural solutions segment where terms are significantly longer than the rest of our business.
(3)   inventory levels dropped slightly in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to inventory management programs and lower fmc agricultural solutions sales in the fourth quarter. inventory levels remained fairly consistent from 2012 to 2013 as projected demand in early 2014 was expected to be in-line with the prior year.
(4)   the decrease in accounts payable in 2014 is consistent with the slight drop in inventory levels at the end of 2014 as discussed above. the increase in accounts payable for 2012 and 2013 is primarily due to inventory build at the end of those years to satisfy projected demand for the following year.
(5)   these rebates are associated with our fmc agricultural solutions segment in north america and brazil and generally settle in the fourth quarter of each year. the changes year over year are primarily associated with the mix in sales eligible for rebates and incentives in 2014 compared to 2013 and timing of rebate payments.
(6)   the advance payments from customers represent advances from our fmc agricultural solutions segment customers.
33
(7)   changes in all periods presented primarily represent timing of payments associated with all other operating assets and liabilities, including guarantees issued to our vendors under our vendor finance program. the change for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 includes an increase in an accrual of $99.6 million for the hedge on the acquisition purchase price of cheminova.
(8)   see note 7 in our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for further details.
(9)   included in our results for each of the years presented are environmental charges for environmental remediation at our operating sites of $43.7 million, $6.2 million and $5.8 million. the amounts in 2014 will be spent in future years. the amounts represent environmental remediation spending at our operating sites which were recorded against pre-existing reserves, net of recoveries.
(10)   amounts include voluntary contributions to our u.s. defined benefit plan of $50 million, $40 million and $65 million, respectively. in 2014 the amount also includes a lump-sum payout of approximately $8.5 million from our nonqualified pension plan.
(11)   interest payments from 2012 to 2013 remained fairly constant. in november 2013 we issued $400 million of senior notes at an interest rate of 4.10%. interest payments in 2014 increased over the preceding year primarily due to interest payments under the $400 million of senior notes as there was no interest payments under these borrowings in 2013.
(12)   the reduction in tax payments from 2013 to 2014 is due to a domestic prepaid tax balance at december 31, 2013 that was applied in first quarter of 2014, thereby reducing tax payments in 2014.
(13)   amounts are presented as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows, from share-based compensation.
cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations was $45.2 million, $50.1 million and $62.6 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the decrease in cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations in 2014 is due to reduced net spending associated with discontinued environmental remediation sites. this reduced spending was slightly offset by increased spending associated with our other discontinued reserve which primarily includes retained legal obligations.
the decrease from 2012 to 2013 is primarily due to reduced spending associated with our discontinued restructuring activities.
cash required by investing activities was $233.7 million, $628.5 million and $363.6 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the decrease in spending in 2014, as compared to 2013 was primarily due to the epax acquisition that was completed in third quarter 2013.
the increase in spending during the year ended december 31, 2013, as compared to the same period in 2012, was primarily due to the epax acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2013 and higher spending on capital expenditures compared to 2012.
cash provided (required) by investing activities of discontinued operations was $198.5 million, $(24.7) million and $(30.0) million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2014 is directly associated with the sale of our fmc peroxygens business which was completed on february 28, 2014. cash required by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2013 and 2012 represents capital expenditures for our discontinued fmc peroxygens business. for more information, see note 9 in our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.
cash provided (required) by financing activities was $(350.0) million, $371.2 million and $(48.2) million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
2014 vs. 2013
the change period over period in financing activities is primarily due to significantly less short-term borrowings in 2014 compared to borrowings in 2013. in 2013, increased borrowings were approximately $889 million compared to repayments in 2014 of $171 million. additionally during the year ended 2013 we paid approximately $367 million in share repurchases and $90 million to noncontrolling interests (primarily to acquire additional ownership in our fmc alkali chemicals division) compared to approximately $103 million in combined payments in 2014.
2013 vs. 2012
the change in financing activities is primarily due to borrowings under our commercial paper ("cp") program which was implemented during the second quarter of 2013 and the issuance of $400 million in senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2013. these borrowings were partially offset by repayments of borrowings under our committed credit facility, the acquisition of an additional 6.25% ownership interest in our consolidated entity fmc wyoming and higher dividends paid and share repurchases compared to 2012.
34
other potential liquidity needs see the preceding liquidity and capital resources section for the discussion of the financing facilities associated with the cheminova acquisition along with the signed definitive agreement to sell the fmc alkali chemicals division for $1.64 billion.
our cash needs for 2015, outside of the cheminova acquisition and related integration expenses, include operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled mandatory payments of long-term debt, dividend payments, share repurchases, contributions to our pension plans, environmental and asset retirement obligation spending and restructuring. we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash, cash generated from operations, commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility. at december 31, 2014 our remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility was $924.0 million (which reflects borrowings under our commercial paper program).
projected 2015 capital expenditures as well as expenditures related to contract manufacturers are expected to be lower than 2014 levels. this excludes spending on the fmc alkali chemicals division and includes expected spending for cheminova subsequent to the acquisition.
projected 2015 spending includes approximately $65 million of net environmental remediation spending. this spending does not include expected spending on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities or expected spending for environmental compliance costs, which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves. capital spending to expand, maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls, which may increase our spending for environmental controls over the foregoing projections.
our u.s. pension plan assets increased from $1,192.9 million at december 31, 2013 to $1,255.1 million at december 31, 2014 due primarily to additional contributions in 2014 as well as stock market performance. our u.s. pension plan assets comprise approximately 93 percent of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10-k for details on how we develop our long-term rate of return assumptions. we made contributions of $50 million and $40 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and intend to contribute $65 million in 2015. our contributions in 2013, 2014 and our intended contribution in 2015 are all in excess of the minimum requirements. our contributions in excess of the minimum requirement are done with the objective of reducing future funding volatility. we do not believe that the additional contribution in 2015 will have a material impact on our current and future liquidity needs. however, volatility of interest rates and equity returns may require greater contributions in the future.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we did not repurchase any shares under the publicly announced repurchase program. at december 31, 2014, $250 million remained unused under our board-authorized repurchase program. this repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time. shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. we also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connections with vesting, exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans.
dividends on january 15, 2015, we paid dividends aggregating $20.1 million to our shareholders of record as of december 31, 2014. this amount is included in "accrued and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2014. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we paid $78.1 million, $73.6 million and $47.8 million in dividends, respectively.
commitments we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain fmc agricultural solutions customers, principally brazilian customers, for their seasonal borrowing. the total of these guarantees was $118.4 million at december 31, 2014. these guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates. non-performance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation requiring us to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee. based on our experience these types guarantees have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or on our liquidity. our expectation is that future payment or performance related to the non-performance of others is considered unlikely.
short-term debt consisted of foreign credit lines and commercial paper at december 31, 2014, and 2013. we provide parent-company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries.
we continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property, plant and equipment that are no longer integral to our operating businesses. in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities, including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale. our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible, minimum claim amount or cap. as such, it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or
35
to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. if triggered, we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties. we have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees.
our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows:
contractual commitments                                                                                                      expected cash payments by year

(1)   excluding discounts.
(2)   contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our long-term debt obligations. we had $1.9 million of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at december 31, 2014. the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at december 31, 2014. variable rates are determined by the market and will fluctuate over time.
(3)   before sub-lease rental income.
(4)   obligations associated with our ewing, nj and shanghai, china research and technology centers.
(5)   purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing of the transaction. we have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where take-or-pay arrangements apply. since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are take-or-pay commitments over the life of the contract as opposed to a year by year take-or-pay, the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts.
(6)   as of december 31, 2014, the liability for uncertain tax positions was $47.1 million and this liability is excluded from the table above. additionally, accrued pension and other postretirement benefits and our environmental liabilities as recorded on our consolidated balance sheets are excluded from the table above. due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and periods in which these liabilities might be paid.
contingencies see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.
climate change we continue to follow legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations. our fmc alkali chemicals division, which we expect to sell in early 2015, mines and refines trona ore into soda ash and related products at our westvaco and granger facilities near green river, wyoming. this activity constitutes most of fmc's greenhouse gas emissions globally. in 2014, we reported approximately 2.4 million metric tons of direct emissions from the green river operations for 2013 as part of the epa greenhouse gas reporting program. also in 2014, our fmc alkali chemicals division received a permit to increase the amount of greenhouse gases emitted from its facility near granger.
a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions at the green river operations are emissions from the beneficiation of trona ore. that is, a significant portion of the greenhouse gases released during the mining and refining of soda ash occurs naturally in the trona ore feedstock. unlike the situation with energy efficiency, where efficiencies may result in a reduction of greenhouse gases, the amount of greenhouse gases present in the trona ore cannot be reduced. all of the companies producing natural soda ash have such refining emissions. yet, the lower energy intensity of natural soda ash provides a favorable carbon intensity compared with synthetic soda ash produced throughout the rest of the world. soda ash is an essential raw material in the production of glass of all kinds. climate change, energy intensity and alternative forms of energy will drive increased production of new forms of glass (lower emissivity glass, solar panel glass, etc.) and will increase the need for this essential raw material from fmc. the soda ash industry has an interest in assuring that climate change legislation or regulation recognizes the benefits of soda ash (particularly natural soda ash) and the challenges facing this industry in controlling its greenhouse gas emissions.
because of the many variables, it is premature to make any estimate of the costs of complying with possible future federal climate change legislation in the united states. however, we are aware of the potential impacts that could result from emissions regulations
36
in the u.s. that are more stringent than those experienced by our global competitors. these could make it more difficult for us to competitively produce natural soda ash at green river. a reduction in natural soda ash production as a result of more stringent regulations in the u.s. would lead to more greenhouse gas emissions globally because the lost supply of natural soda ash would be replaced by the more costly and more greenhouse gas intensive synthetic soda ash.
in 2014, two u.s. plants in our fmc health & nutrition business also reported emissions above the epa's reporting threshold, but each plant's emissions are substantially less than at our green river operations, in total less than 0.1 million metric tons.
at this point our other u.s. facilities are not subject to any state or regional greenhouse gas regulation that limits or imposes fees on current emissions, and while some of our foreign operations may be subject to national or local energy management or climate change regulation, the cost to these facilities has not been and is not expected to be material to fmc.
we have considered the potential physical risks to fmc facilities and operations and the indirect consequences of regulation or business trends as a result of potential future climate change. we routinely assess our facilities for potential natural hazard exposures and do not expect material impacts based on currently available information.
recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements and regulatory items see note 2 "recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements and regulatory items" to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.
off-balance sheet arrangements see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k and part i, item 3 - legal proceedings for further information regarding any off-balance sheet arrangements.
fair value measurements see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for additional discussion surrounding our fair value measurements.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) . the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. we have described our accounting policies in note 1 "principal accounting policies and related financial information" to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k. we have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors. critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with u.s. gaap and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors.
environmental obligations and related recoveries we provide for environmental-related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used.
estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the united states environmental protection agency ("epa"), or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision ("rod"), or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a remedial investigation/feasibility study ("ri/fs"), or equivalent, that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies. estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.
our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment. such costs principally include, among other items, ri/fs, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, management
37
costs, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants' engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites.
included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation, maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans (om&m). such reserves are based on our best estimates for these om&m plans. over time we may incur om&m costs in excess of these reserves. however, we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such om&m plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation, as conditions at these environmental sites change over time. such additional om&m costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years.
included in the environmental reserve balance, other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies, which we believe are probable of recovery.
provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties ("prps") or other third parties. such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values.
in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves, we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act ("cercla") and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other prps at each site to the extent possible. we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site-by-site basis. our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects. recoveries are recorded as either an offset in "environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued" or as "other assets" in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with u.s. accounting literature.
see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations.
impairments and valuation of long-lived assets our long-lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. the principal assumptions utilized in our valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates and discount rates. although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.
we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of our property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets, which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time.
we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of each year, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occur that would require reassessment of the recoverability of those assets. in performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting units, anticipated changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and cost factors such as raw material prices. based on our assessment for 2014, we determined that no impairment charge to our continuing operations was required.
see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for charges associated with long-lived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves.
38
pension and other postretirement benefits we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees. the costs (benefits) and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees. the costs (benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, such as average retirement age, mortality, employee turnover, and plan participation. to the extent our plans' actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans' demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans' funding requirements, could increase or decrease. when actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. in addition, the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs (benefits) in future periods.
in 2014, the society of actuaries released new mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale for measurement of retirement program obligations. we adopted these new tables in measuring the december 31, 2014 u.s. defined benefit and post retirement obligations. this adoption has increased the benefit obligations at december 31, 2014 by approximately $95 million. the effect of this adoption will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost beginning in 2015.
we use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans' funding requirements. the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market-related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five-year period. we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans' funding requirements. the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly.
we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date. in selecting a discount rate as of december 31, 2014, we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yield-curve provided by our actuary. this yield-curve when populated with projected cash flows that represented the expected timing and amount of our plans' benefit payments, produced a single effective interest discount rate of 4.15 percent, which was used to measure the plan's liabilities.
the discount rates used at our december 31, 2014 and 2013 measurement dates were 4.15 percent and 4.95 percent, respectively. the effect of the change in the discount rate from 4.95 percent to 4.15 percent at december 31, 2014 resulted in a $143.2 million increase to our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. the effect of the change in the discount rate from 4.15 percent at december 31, 2012 to 4.95 percent at december 31, 2013 resulted in a $8.8 million decrease to 2014 pension and other postretirement benefit expense.
the change in discount rate from 4.95 percent at december 31, 2013 to 4.15 percent at december 31, 2014 was attributable to a decrease in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2013 and 2014 measurement dates. using the december 31, 2013 yield curve, our plan cash flows produced a single weighted-average discount rate of approximately 4.95 percent. matching our plan cash flows to a similarly constructed curve reflecting high-yielding bonds available as of december 31, 2014, resulted in a single weighted-average discount rate of approximately 4.15 percent.
in developing the assumption for the long-term rate of return on assets for our u.s. plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on the assumption for long-term real returns by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. we also consider the historical performance of our own plan's trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 10.3 percent over the last 20 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors which are discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k. our long-term rate of return for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was 7.75 percent.

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions.
a one-half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $89.6 million and $67.2 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by $6.9 million, $5.8 million and $8.2 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. a one-half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $99.4 million, $73.9 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by $7.5 million, $6.2 million and $8.4 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
a one-half percent increase in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $5.2 million, $4.8 million and $4.7 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. a one-half percent decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by $5.2 million, $4.8 million and $4.7 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs (benefits) are found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. in assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income, the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies. in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made.
additionally, we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. the income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the u.s. and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment. we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. we adjust these liabilities, if necessary, upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law.
see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for additional discussion surrounding income taxes.

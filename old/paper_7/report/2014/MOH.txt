item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with items 6 and 8 of this form 10-k, selected financial data, and financial statements and supplementary data, respectively. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k, risk factors.
overview molina healthcare, inc. provides quality health care to those receiving government assistance. we offer cost-effective medicaid-related solutions to meet the health care needs of low-income families and individuals, and to assist state agencies in their administration of the medicaid program. we report our financial performance based on two reportable segments: the health plans segment and the molina medicaid solutions segment.
our health plans segment consists of health plans in 11 states, and includes our direct delivery business. as of december 31, 2014, these health plans served over 2.6 million members eligible for medicaid, medicare, and other government-sponsored health care programs for low-income families and individuals. additionally, we serve a small number of health insurance marketplace members, many of whom are eligible for government premium subsidies. the health plans are operated by our respective wholly owned subsidiaries in those states, each of which is licensed as a health maintenance organization (hmo). our direct delivery business consists primarily of the management of a hospital in southern california under a management services agreement, and the operation of primary care clinics in several states in which we operate.
our molina medicaid solutions segment provides business processing and information technology development and administrative services to medicaid agencies in idaho, louisiana, maine, new jersey, west virginia, and the u.s. virgin islands, and drug rebate administration services in florida.
we previously reported that our medicaid managed care contract with the state of missouri expired without renewal in 2012, and effective june 2013 the transition obligations associated with that contract terminated. therefore, beginning in the second quarter of 2013, we reported the results relating to the missouri health plan as discontinued operations for all periods presented. the following discussion and analysis, with the exception of cash flow information, is presented in the context of continuing operations unless otherwise noted.
fiscal year 2014 financial highlights
•   net income from continuing operations increased to $62.6 million in 2014, from $44.8 million in 2013 due to increases in enrollment and revenue, and improved administrative cost efficiency; which offset higher medical costs and higher tax rates.
•   strong enrollment growth across all of our programs combined with an 18% increase in premium revenue per member, generated almost $3 billion, or 46%, more premium revenue in 2014 compared with 2013.
•   general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to 7.9% in 2014, versus 10.1% in 2013.
•   medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue increased to 89.5% in 2014, from 87.1% in 2013.
•   debt financing transactions generated net cash of $122.6 million; such transactions both extended the maturity date and lowered the rate of our convertible senior notes previously due in 2014.
health care reform we believe that the government-sponsored initiatives, including the affordable care act (aca), will continue to provide us with significant opportunities for membership growth in our existing markets and in new programs in the future as follows:
•   medicaid expansion. in the states that have elected to participate, the aca provides for the expansion of the medicaid program to offer eligibility to nearly all low-income people under age 65 with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty line. medicaid expansion membership phased in beginning january 1, 2014. since that date, our health plans in california, illinois, michigan, new mexico, ohio, and washington have begun participating in medicaid expansion. at december 31, 2014 our membership included approximately 385,000 medicaid expansion members, or 15% of total membership.
•   marketplace. the aca authorized the creation of marketplace insurance exchanges, allowing individuals and small groups to purchase health insurance that is federally subsidized, effective january 1, 2014. we participate in the marketplace in all of the states in which we operate, except illinois and south carolina. at december 31, 2014, we had approximately 15,000 marketplace members, and that enrollment is expected to grow appreciably in 2015, particularly at our florida health plan.
37
•   medicare-medicaid plans. policymakers at the federal and state levels are increasingly focused on the design and implementation of programs that improve the coordination of care for those who qualify to receive both medicare and medicaid services (the "dual eligible"), and to deliver services to the dual eligible in a more financially efficient manner. as a result of these efforts, 15 states have undertaken demonstration programs to integrate medicare and medicaid services for dual-eligible individuals. the health plans participating in such demonstrations are referred to as medicare-medicaid plans (mmps). our mmps in california, illinois, and ohio offered coverage beginning in 2014, and we expect to begin offering mmp coverage in south carolina and texas in the first quarter of 2015, and in michigan in the second quarter of 2015.
health insurer fee. the aca imposes an annual fee, or excise tax, on health insurers for each calendar year beginning on or after january 1, 2014. a health insurer's liability for the payment of the fee (the health insurer fee, or hif) is established upon first writing business in 2014 or any subsequent year. in other words, an active health insurer becomes liable for the fee on january 1st of any given year. the amount of the hif for the insurer is based upon the insurer's share of the industry's net premiums written during the preceding calendar year. the hif must be paid by the insurer by september 30th of the year in which the insurer becomes liable for the hif. during the third quarter of 2014 we paid our 2014 hif assessment, which amounted to $88.6 million. this expense was recognized on a straight-line basis in 2014; and is non-deductible for income tax purposes.
we believe that state medicaid agencies are required to reimburse us for the hif imposed on our medicaid premiums, as well as for the negative financial impact associated with the absence of tax deductibility for the hif. although all of our state medicaid partners have agreed informally to reimbursement of the hif and the costs of its related tax effects, we have not secured binding commitments to that effect from california, michigan and utah. our 2014 results were adversely affected by our inability to recognize as revenue reimbursement (including reimbursement for tax effects) for the full impact of the hif from those states. the state of california has not formally committed to reimburse us for either the hif itself, or the related tax effects. the states of michigan and utah have reimbursed us for the hif, but have not formally committed to reimbursement for the related tax effect. the total amount of hif revenue for which agreements were not secured (and revenue was not recognized) amounted to approximately $20 million for fiscal 2014. we expect to collect and recognize this revenue related to 2014 in 2015. we further expect to recognize revenue in 2015 sufficient to reimburse us for the full amount of the hif we will pay (along with related tax effects) in september of 2015. we expect our 2015 hif assessment related to our medicaid business to be approximately $143 million, with an expected tax effect from the reimbursement of the assessment of approximately $88 million. therefore, the total reimbursement needed as a result of the medicaid-related hif is approximately $231 million.
for further discussion of the risks and uncertainties relating to the hif, refer to the subheading below, "liquidity and capital resources-financial condition."
market updates-health plans segment florida. during 2014, our florida health plan acquired two medicaid contracts, adding approximately 73,000 members.
puerto rico. in 2014, we were awarded a managed care contract in the commonwealth of puerto rico that is expected to enroll its first members april 1, 2015. total enrollment is expected to be approximately 350,000 new members, with anticipated annualized revenue of $750 million.
south carolina. our south carolina health plan began serving members under the state of south carolina's new full-risk medicaid managed care program effective january 1, 2014.
market update-molina medicaid solutions segment in 2011, molina medicaid solutions received notice from the state of louisiana that the state intended to award the contract for a replacement medicaid management information system (mmis) to a different vendor, cnsi. however, in march 2013, the state of louisiana canceled its contract award to cnsi. the state had informed us that we will continue to perform under our current contract until a successor is named. on december 18, 2014, molina medicaid solutions received notice from the state of louisiana that they have extended our contract through december 31, 2015. we recognized approximately $41 million of service revenue under this contract in 2014.
composition of revenue and membership health plans segment our health plans segment derives its revenue, in the form of premiums, chiefly from medicaid contracts with the states in which our health plans operate; and, to a lesser degree, from medicare contracts entered into with the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms), a federal government agency.
our health plans' state medicaid contracts generally have terms of three to four years. these contracts typically contain renewal options exercisable by the state medicaid agency, and allow either the state or the health plan to terminate the contract with or
38
without cause. our health plan subsidiaries have generally been successful in retaining their contracts, but such contracts are subject to risk of loss when a state issues a new request for proposals (rfp) open to competitive bidding by other health plans. if one of our health plans is not a successful responsive bidder to a state rfp, its contract may be subject to non-renewal. the state medicaid programs and the federal medicare program periodically adjust premium rates.
in addition to contract renewal, our state medicaid contracts may be periodically amended to include or exclude certain health benefits (such as pharmacy services, behavioral health services, or long-term care services); populations such as the aged, blind or disabled (abd); and regions or service areas.
premium revenue is fixed in advance of the periods covered and, except as described in item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2 "significant accounting policies," is not generally subject to significant accounting estimates. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we received more than 95% of our premium revenue as a fixed amount per member per month (pmpm), pursuant to our medicaid, medicare and marketplace contracts, including agreements with other managed care organizations for which we operate as a subcontractor. these premium revenues are recognized in the month that members are entitled to receive health care services. revenue not received on a fixed pmpm basis is recognized as earned.
the amount of the premiums paid to us may vary substantially between states and among various government programs. the following table sets forth the ranges of premiums paid to our state health plans by program, on a per-member per-month basis for the year ended december 31, 2014. the "consolidated" column represents the weighted-average amounts for our total membership by program.

molina medicaid solutions segment the payments received by our molina medicaid solutions segment under its state contracts are based on the performance of multiple services. the first of these is the design, development and implementation (ddi) of a medicaid management information system (mmis). an additional service, following completion of ddi, is the operation of the mmis under a business process outsourcing (bpo) arrangement. when providing bpo services (which include claims payment and eligibility processing) we also provide the state with other services including both hosting and support, and maintenance. because we have determined the services provided under our molina medicaid solutions contracts represent a single unit of accounting, we recognize revenue associated with such contracts on a straight-line basis over the contract term during which bpo, hosting, and support and maintenance services are delivered. there may be certain contractual provisions containing contingencies, however that require us to delay recognition of all or part of our service revenue until such contingencies have been removed. for further information regarding revenue recognition for the molina medicaid solutions segment, refer to item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, in note 2, "significant accounting policies."
composition of expenses health plans segment operating expenses for the health plans segment include expenses related to the provision of medical care services (including long-term services and supports, or ltss), general and administrative expenses, premium tax and health insurer fee expenses. our results of operations are impacted by our ability to effectively manage expenses related to medical care services and to accurately estimate medical costs incurred. expenses related to medical care services are captured in the following categories:
•   fee-for-service expenses: nearly all hospital services and the majority of our primary care and physician specialist services and ltss costs are paid on a fee-for-service basis. under fee-for-service arrangements, we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided and incur costs based on actual utilization of services. such expenses are
40
recorded in the period in which the related services are dispensed. the costs of drugs administered in a physician or hospital setting that are not billed through our pharmacy benefit manager are included in fee-for-service costs.
•   pharmacy expenses: all drug, injectibles, and immunization costs paid through our pharmacy benefit manager are classified as pharmacy expenses. as noted above, drugs and injectibles not paid through our pharmacy benefit manager are included in fee-for-service costs, except in those limited instances where we capitate drug and injectible costs.
•   capitation expenses: many of our primary care physicians and a small portion of our specialists and hospitals are paid on a capitated basis. under capitation arrangements, we pay a fixed amount pmpm to the provider without regard to the frequency, extent, or nature of the medical services actually furnished. under capitated arrangements, we remain liable for the provision of certain health care services. capitation payments are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates. these payments are expensed in the period the providers are obligated to provide services. the financial risk for pharmacy services for a small portion of our membership is delegated to capitated providers.
•   direct delivery expenses: all costs associated with our direct delivery of medical care are separately identified.
•   other medical expenses: all medically related administrative costs, certain provider incentive costs, reinsurance costs and other health care expenses are classified as other medical expenses. medically related administrative costs include, for example, expenses relating to health education, quality assurance, case management, care coordination, disease management, and 24-hour on-call nurses. salary and benefit costs are a substantial portion of these expenses. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, medically related administrative costs were $262.6 million, $153.0 million, and $125.2 million, respectively.
our medical care costs include amounts that have been paid by us through the reporting date as well as estimated liabilities for medical care costs incurred but not paid by us as of the reporting date. see "critical accounting estimates" below, and item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, in note 11, "medical claims and benefits payable," for further information on how we estimate such liabilities.
molina medicaid solutions segment cost of service revenue consists primarily of the costs incurred to provide bpo and technology outsourcing services under our mmis contracts. general and administrative costs consist primarily of indirect administrative costs and business development costs. in some circumstances we may defer recognition of incremental direct costs (such as direct labor, hardware, and software) associated with a contract if revenue recognition is also deferred. such deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract term, consistent with the revenue recognition period.

financial performance summary, continuing operations the following table and narrative briefly summarize our financial and operating performance from continuing operations for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012. all ratios, with the exception of the medical care ratio and the premium tax ratio, are computed as a percentage of total revenue. the medical care ratio is computed as a percentage of premium revenue, and the premium tax ratio is computed as a percentage of premium revenue plus premium tax revenue, because direct relationships exist between premium revenue earned, and the cost of health care and premium taxes.

non-gaap financial measures we use the following non-gaap financial measures as supplemental metrics in evaluating our financial performance, making financing and business decisions, and forecasting and planning for future periods. for these reasons, management believes such measures are useful supplemental measures to investors in comparing our performance and the performance of other companies in the health care industry. these non-gaap financial measures should be considered as supplements to, and not substitutes for or superior to, gaap measures (gaap stands for u.s. generally accepted accounting principles).
the first of these non-gaap measures is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or ebitda. the following table reconciles net income, which we believe to be the most comparable gaap measure, to ebitda.

health plans segment premium revenue a 28% increase in membership and an 18% increase in revenue pmpm in 2014 resulted in an increase in premium revenue of 46%, or over $2.8 billion, when compared with 2013. medicare premium revenue was approximately $627 million in the year ended december 31, 2014, compared with approximately $526 million in the year ended december 31, 2013.
enrollment growth was primarily due to medicaid expansion program membership added as a result of the affordable care act, and membership added at our south carolina and illinois health plans. higher pmpm premium revenue was primarily the result of the inclusion of long-term services and supports (ltss) benefits in various medicaid managed care programs in california, florida, illinois, new mexico, and ohio.
medical care costs although medical margin (defined as the excess of premium revenue over medical care costs) increased nearly 20% in 2014 over 2013; our consolidated medical care ratio (defined as medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue) increased to 89.5% in 2014 from 87.1% in 2013.
the medical care ratio increased substantially in 2014 as a result of three developments:
•   much of our revenue growth has come from participation in medicaid programs covering ltss. percentage profit margins for ltss benefits are generally lower than percentage profit margins for acute medical benefits.
•   increases to our base premiums in recent years have not kept pace with medical cost trends.
•   lack of coordination in the design of profit caps and medical cost floors in some of our state medicaid contracts is resulting in counterproductive outcomes. in some instances, givebacks due to profitable performance in one product cannot be offset against losses in other products.
medical care ratios by program for 2014 were as follows: tanf and chip - 89.3%; medicaid expansion - 79.4%;
abd - 92.3%; medicare - 95.8%; mmp integrated - 92.1%; and marketplace - 83.7%.

individual health plan analysis california. the medical care ratio for the california health plan decreased significantly to 83.3% in 2014, from 88.9% in 2013. additionally, medical margin improved $171.0 million when compared with 2013. this improvement was the result of higher enrollment, primarily due to the addition of approximately 107,000 medicaid expansion members; and premium increases effective october 1, 2013 (2.5%), and july 1, 2014 (5.5%). during 2014, the california health plan benefited from the recognition of approximately $23 million in premium revenue that related to 2013 as a result of certain programmatic changes implemented by the state of california. in 2013, the california health plan recognized approximately $32 million of premium revenue related to 2012 and earlier years as a result of retroactive rate increases from the state of california. the california health plan served its first mmp members in 2014.
florida. due to the re-procurement undertaken by the florida agency for health care administration as part of its managed medical assistance program starting in 2014, the florida health plan transitioned many of its members to other health plans in the second quarter of 2014, and then added approximately 105,000 members in the second half of 2014, both from the addition of new service areas and through acquisitions. although revenue increased approximately 66% at the florida health plan for the year ended december 31, 2014, when compared with 2013, profitability fell in 2014. medical margin declined $14.1 million, and the medical care ratio increased to 95.5% from 87.3% in 2013. the higher medical care costs were the result of 1) the assumption of risk for ltss benefits for certain members effective december 2013 (as noted above percentage profit margins for ltss benefits are generally less than those for other benefits); and 2) our inability to recognize revenue related to a rate increase effective september 1, 2014, as a result of those rates not being finalized prior to year end.
illinois. the medical care ratio for the illinois health plan decreased to 91.7% in 2014, from 96.9% in 2013. the plan experienced significant growth in 2014; enrollment increased approximately 96,000 members overall, with 78,000 members added in the fourth quarter alone. this growth occurred primarily within the traditional tanf program, and to a lesser degree within the medicaid expansion program. the illinois health plan served its first mmp members in 2014.
michigan. the medical care ratio of the michigan health plan was consistent year over year, at 84.6% in 2014, compared with 84.4% in 2013.
new mexico. premium revenue at the new mexico health plan increased 141% for 2014 compared with 2013, primarily as a result of the addition of medicaid behavioral health and ltss benefits effective january 1, 2014, and the addition of approximately 54,000 medicaid expansion members during the course of 2014. the medical care ratio of the new mexico health plan increased to 92.6% in 2014, from 86.1% in 2013. the higher medical care ratio was the result of 1) the assumption of risk for ltss benefits effective january 1, 2014; and 2) premium rates effective january 1, 2014 that did not keep pace with the increase in medical costs in 2014. the new mexico health plan received a blended rate increase of approximately 3% effective january 1, 2015. for the portion of new mexico health plan's membership that is eligible for ltss benefits, the rate increase effective january 1, 2015 was 8%.
ohio. the medical care ratio of the ohio health plan increased to 86.0% in 2014, from 84.2% in 2013, primarily due to the increase in medicaid expansion enrollment (which is incurring a medical care ratio slightly in excess of the plan's traditional experience), and the initiation of the ohio mmp.
south carolina. our south carolina health plan commenced operations effective january 1, 2014 and finished the year with a medical care ratio of 84.7%.
texas. financial performance at the texas health plan declined in 2014, when compared with 2013. the medical care ratio of the texas health plan increased to 90.8% in 2014, from 86.4% in 2013. our inability to recognize a portion of the texas health

plan's quality revenue reduced income before taxes by approximately $26 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the year ended december 31, 2014. approximately $20 million of this amount is related to measures for which we lack sufficient information to calculate our compliance. should such information become available in the future, we may be able to recognize all or a portion of such revenue. removing quality revenue and profit-sharing adjustments would have resulted in a medical care ratio at the texas health plan of approximately 88% in 2014 and 86% in 2013.
utah. the medical care ratio of the utah health plan increased to 92.2% in 2014, from 83.4% in 2013, due to deteriorating margins for both medicaid and medicare products.
washington. financial performance at the washington health plan declined in 2014, when compared with 2013. the medical care ratio of the washington health plan increased to 93.4% in 2014, compared with 88.0% in 2013, primarily due to the high cost of medical services relative to revenue for members served under the state's program for abd members; and to the $11.2 million net settlement with the washington health care authority, as described in item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, in note 20, "commitments and contingencies." the washington health plan added approximately 102,000 medicaid expansion members in 2014. the washington health plan received a blended rate increase of approximately 3% effective january 1, 2015. for the washington health plan's abd membership, the rate increase effective january 1, 2015 was 11%.
wisconsin. the medical care ratio of the wisconsin health plan increased to 86.8% in 2014, compared with 79.7% in 2013.

operating income for our molina medicaid solutions segment improved $10.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared with 2013. this improvement was primarily the result of increased revenues due to higher medicaid transaction volumes and lower cost of services overall, as existing contract operations gained efficiencies.
consolidated expenses general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to 7.9% of revenue in 2014, from 10.1% in 2013. the significant decline in the ratio of general and administrative expenses relative to total revenue was primarily the result of improved leverage of fixed administrative expenses over higher total revenue.

premium tax expense premium tax expense was 3.2% in 2014, compared with 2.7% in 2013. in june 2014, the state of michigan instituted a 6% use tax on medical premiums. that state has agreed to fund this tax through rate increases; as a result, we recorded approximately $30 million in additional premium revenue in 2014, as well as corresponding premium tax expense.

individual health plan analysis california. financial performance improved at the california health plan in 2013, when compared with 2012, primarily due to the receipt of premium rate increases for both tanf and abd membership; and lower inpatient facility costs for the tanf membership. approximately $32 million of premium revenue received and recognized in 2013 related to 2012 and earlier years. the medical care ratio at the california health plan decreased to 88.9% in 2013 from 91.1% in 2012.
florida. the medical care ratio of the florida health plan increased to 87.3% in 2013, from 85.3% in 2012, due to higher fee-for-service costs that more than offset lower pharmacy costs.
illinois. the medical care ratio for the illinois health plan was 96.9% in 2013. the illinois health plan served its first member effective september 2013.
michigan. financial performance improved at the michigan health plan in 2013, when compared with 2012. the medical care ratio of the michigan health plan decreased to 84.4% in 2013, from 88.3% in 2012, primarily due to lower fee-for-service and pharmacy costs for both the abd and the tanf membership.

utah. financial performance deteriorated at the utah health plan in 2013, when compared with 2012. reductions to the medical portion of the medicaid premium, and the addition of the pharmacy benefit to our medicaid premium, both effective january 1, 2013, more than offset stable medical costs. the medical care ratio of the utah health plan increased to 83.4% in 2013, from 82.3% in 2012.
washington. the medical care ratio of the washington health plan increased to 88.0% in 2013, compared with 86.8% in 2012, due to the addition of abd members effective july 1, 2012 and lower tanf premium rates. the higher premium revenue pmpm associated with the abd membership, however, offset the increased medical care ratio, so that medical margin increased to $140.2 million in 2013, from $129.0 million in 2012.
wisconsin. financial performance improved at the wisconsin health plan in 2013, when compared with 2012. the medical care ratio of the wisconsin health plan decreased to 79.7% in 2013, compared with 96.2% in 2012, due to both higher revenue pmpm and lower fee-for-service physician, specialty and outpatient costs pmpm. additionally, the health plan gained approximately 50,000 members in the first half of 2013 due to another health plan's exit from the market.

interest expense interest expense was $52.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared with $16.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. interest expense includes non-cash interest expense relating to the amortization of the discount on our long-term debt obligations, which amounted to $22.8 million and $5.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2013, was primarily due to our issuance of $550.0 million aggregate principal amount 1.125% cash convertible senior notes due 2020 (the 1.125% notes) in the first quarter of 2013. interest expense in 2013 also included the immediate recognition of approximately $6 million in debt issuance costs associated with this transaction. the remaining fees associated with that issuance, amounting to approximately $12 million, are being amortized over the life of the 1.125% notes. for the year ended december 31, 2013, interest expense also includes amounts relating to lease financing transactions executed in the second quarter of 2013.
other expenses, net other expenses, net increased to $3.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from $0.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. other expenses, net include primarily gains or losses associated with changes in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments. in the second quarter of 2013 we recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $3.9 million related to the change in fair value of warrants issued in connection with the 1.125% notes. we settled the interest rate swap in the second quarter of 2013, which resulted in a gain of $0.4 million, partially offsetting the $3.9 million charge described above. other expenses, net was $0.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily due to the change in fair value of the interest rate swap.
income taxes the provision for income taxes in continuing operations is recorded at an effective rate of 44.8% for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared with 45.0% for the year ended december 31, 2012.
liquidity and capital resources introduction we manage our cash, investments, and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. we forecast, analyze, and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy.
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue. such cash flows are our primary source of liquidity. thus, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. we generally receive premium revenue a short time before we pay for the related health care services. a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents, and investments. after considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, and marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. these investments are made pursuant to board approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations. our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital, and maximize total return on invested assets, all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest. these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of 10 years or less (excluding auction rate securities and variable rate securities, for which interest rates are periodically reset) and that the average maturity be three years or less. professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments. as of december 31, 2014, a substantial portion of our cash was invested in a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities, and our investments consisted solely of investment-grade debt securities. all of our investments are classified as current assets, except for our restricted investments, and our investments in auction rate securities, which are classified as non-current assets. our restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit and u.s. treasury securities.
investment income increased to $8.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared with $6.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to the increase in invested assets. our annualized portfolio yields for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 were 0.4% and for 2012 was 0.5%.
investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase. we have the ability to hold our restricted investments until maturity. declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income.
cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid to our non-regulated parent company in the form of dividends, when and as permitted by applicable regulations, for general corporate use. we did not receive any dividends from our health plan subsidiaries during the year ended december 31, 2014, because significant growth across all of our health plans necessitated that the plans retain their capital for operations. see further discussion in item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 20, "commitments and contingencies," under the subheading

operating activities. cash provided by operating activities was $1,060.3 million in 2014 compared with $190.1 million in 2013, an increase of $870.2 million. this increase was due primarily to the following:
•   $441.8 million increase in amounts due to government agencies, due to a significant increase in amounts accrued for medical cost floor contract provisions primarily associated with our medicaid expansion membership; and
•   $355.5 million increase in medical claims and benefits payable due to significant membership growth in 2014.
in 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $190.1 million compared with $347.8 million for 2012, a decrease of $157.7 million. in 2013, deferred revenue was a use of cash from operations amounting to $19.6 million, compared with a source of cash amounting to $90.9 million in 2012. this was primarily due to an advance premium payment received by our washington health plan in december 2012, with no comparable advance premium receipts in december 2013.
investing activities. cash used in investing activities decreased to $535.7 million in 2014, compared with $543.3 million in 2013. this $7.6 million decline in cash used was primarily due to lower purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities, compared with 2013. as described below, there was greater investment activity in 2013 associated with significant debt financing transactions.
in 2013, cash used in investing activities was $543.3 million compared with $93.6 million in 2012. this $449.7 million increase was primarily due to greater purchases of investments in 2013, as a result of the cash generated in financing activities, described below. in addition to increased purchases of investments, we paid $61.5 million in connection with business combinations in 2013, with no comparable activity in 2012.
financing activities. cash provided by financing activities was $78.6 million in 2014 compared with $493.4 million in 2013, a decrease of $414.7 million. cash provided by financing activities in 2014 included primarily $122.6 million net proceeds from our fiscal 2014 offering of 1.625% notes, partially offset by $50.3 million paid in the settlement of contingent consideration liabilities associated with our 2013 business combinations. cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was significantly outpaced by debt financing activities in 2013, as described below.
in 2013, cash provided by financing activities was $493.4 million compared with $47.7 million in 2012, an increase of $445.6 million. the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to 2013 activity including $538.0 million in proceeds received from our offering of 1.125% notes, $158.7 million received from sale-leaseback transactions, and $75.1 million from the sale of warrants, partially offset by $149.3 million paid for the purchased call option relating to 1.125% notes, $52.7 million paid for repurchases of our common stock, $47.5 million used to repay our term loan, and $40.0 million used to repay our credit facility. our credit facility was terminated in early 2013 when the balance was repaid.

financial condition on a consolidated basis, at december 31, 2014, our working capital was $1,070.6 million compared with $745.7 million at december 31, 2013. at december 31, 2014, our cash and investments amounted to $2,665.9 million, compared with $1,712.9 million of cash and investments at december 31, 2013.
health insurer fee. one notable provision of the aca is an excise tax or annual fee that applies to most health plans, including commercial health plans and medicaid managed care plans like molina healthcare. while characterized as a "fee" in the text of the aca, the intent of congress was to impose a broad-based health insurance industry excise tax, with the understanding that the tax could be passed on to consumers, most likely through higher commercial insurance premiums.
however, because medicaid is a government funded program, medicaid health plans have no alternative but to look to their respective state partners for payment to offset the impact of this tax. additionally, when states reimburse us for the amount of the hif, that reimbursement is itself subject to income tax, the hif, and applicable state premium taxes. because the hif is not deductible for income tax purposes, our net income is reduced by the full amount of the assessment. we expect our 2015 hif assessment related to our medicaid business to be approximately $143 million, with an expected tax effect from the reimbursement of the assessment of approximately $88 million. therefore, the total reimbursement needed as a result of the medicaid-related hif is approximately $231 million.
our 2014 hif assessment amounted to $88.6 million, which was paid in september 2014. as indicated in the table below, it was necessary for the states to pay us an incremental amount of approximately $131 million during 2014 to account for the hif and the absence of its deductibility.
the state of california has not formally committed to reimburse us for either the hif itself, or the related tax effects. the states of michigan and utah have reimbursed us for the hif, but have not formally committed to reimbursement for the related tax effect. the total amount of hif revenue for which agreements were not secured (and revenue was not recognized) amounted to approximately $20 million for fiscal 2014. we expect to collect and recognize this revenue related to 2014 in 2015. we further expect to recognize revenue in 2015 sufficient to reimburse us for the full amount of the hif we will pay (along with related tax effects) in september of 2015.
we continue to work with our state partners to obtain reimbursement for the full economic impact of the excise tax. the failure of our state partners to reimburse us in full for the hif and its related tax effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

_______________________________
(1)   "other" medical claims and benefits payable include amounts payable to certain providers for which we act as an intermediary on behalf of various state agencies without assuming financial risk. such receipts and payments do not impact our consolidated statements of income. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded non-risk provider payables relating to such intermediary arrangements of approximately $119.3 million and $151.3 million, respectively.
the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable is particularly important to the determination of our financial position and results of operations in any given period. such determination of our liability requires the application of a significant degree of judgment by our management.
as a result, the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable is subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. our medical care costs include amounts that have been paid by us through the reporting date, as well as estimated
54
liabilities for medical care costs incurred but not paid by us as of the reporting date. such medical care cost liabilities include, among other items, unpaid fee-for-service claims, capitation payments owed providers, unpaid pharmacy invoices, and various medically related administrative costs that have been incurred but not paid. we use judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions for determining the required estimates.
the most important element in estimating our medical care costs is our estimate for fee-for-service claims which have been incurred but not paid by us. these fee-for-service costs that have been incurred but have not been paid at the reporting date are collectively referred to as medical costs that are incurred but not paid (ibnp). our ibnp, as reported on our balance sheet, represents our best estimate of the total amount of claims we will ultimately pay with respect to claims that we have incurred as of the balance sheet date. we estimate our ibnp monthly using actuarial methods based on a number of factors. as indicated in the table above, our estimated ibnp liability represented $870.4 million of our total medical claims and benefits payable of $1,200.5 million as of december 31, 2014. excluding amounts that we anticipate paying on behalf of certain capitated providers in ohio (which we will subsequently withhold from those providers' monthly capitation payments), our ibnp liability at december 31, 2014, was $861.8 million.
the factors we consider when estimating our ibnp include, without limitation, claims receipt and payment experience (and variations in that experience), changes in membership, provider billing practices, health care service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza, provider contract changes, changes to medicaid fee schedules, and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims. our assessment of these factors is then translated into an estimate of our ibnp liability at the relevant measuring point through the calculation of a base estimate of ibnp, a further provision for adverse claims deviation, and an estimate of the administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date. the base estimate of ibnp is derived through application of claims payment completion factors and trended pmpm cost estimates.
for the fifth month of service prior to the reporting date and earlier, we estimate our outstanding claims liability based on actual claims paid, adjusted for estimated completion factors. completion factors seek to measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will have been paid for a given month of service as of the reporting date, based on historical payment patterns.
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december 31, 2014 that would have resulted had we changed our completion factors for the fifth through the twelfth months preceding december 31, 2014, by the percentages indicated. a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities. dollar amounts are in thousands.

for the four months of service immediately prior to the reporting date, actual claims paid are not a reliable measure of our ultimate liability, given the inherent delay between the patient/physician encounter and the actual submission of a claim for payment. for these months of service, we estimate our claims liability based on trended pmpm cost estimates. these estimates are designed to reflect recent trends in payments and expense, utilization patterns, authorized services, and other relevant factors. the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december 31, 2014 that would have resulted had we altered our trend factors by the percentages indicated. an increase in the pmpm costs results in an increase in medical claims liabilities. dollar amounts are in thousands.

the following per-share amounts are based on a combined federal and state statutory tax rate of 37%, and 48.3 million diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31, 2014. assuming a hypothetical 1% change in completion factors from those used in our calculation of ibnp at december 31, 2014, net income for the year ended december 31, 2014 would increase or decrease by approximately $23 million, or $0.48 per diluted share. assuming a hypothetical 1% change in pmpm cost estimates from those used in our calculation of ibnp at december 31, 2014, net income for the year ended december 31, 2014 would increase or decrease by approximately $14 million, or $0.29 per diluted share. the corresponding figures for a 5% change in completion factors and pmpm cost estimates would be $117 million, or $2.42 per diluted share, and $71 million, or $1.47 per diluted share, respectively.
it is important to note that any change in the estimate of either completion factors or trended pmpm costs would usually be accompanied by a change in the estimate of the other component, and that a change in one component would almost always compound rather than offset the resulting distortion to net income. when completion factors are overestimated, trended pmpm costs tend to be underestimated. both circumstances will create an overstatement of net income. likewise, when completion factors are underestimated, trended pmpm costs tend to be overestimated, creating an understatement of net income. in other words, errors in estimates involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will usually act to drive estimates of claims liabilities and medical care costs in the same direction. if completion factors were overestimated by 1%, resulting in an overstatement of net income by approximately $23 million, it is likely that trended pmpm costs would be underestimated, resulting in an additional overstatement of net income.
after we have established our base ibnp reserve through the application of completion factors and trended pmpm cost estimates, we then compute an additional liability, once again using actuarial techniques, to account for adverse deviation in our claims payments which the base actuarial model is not intended to and does not account for. we refer to this additional liability as the provision for adverse claims deviation. the provision for adverse claims deviation is a component of our overall determination of the adequacy of our ibnp. it is intended to capture the potential inadequacy of our ibnp estimate as a result of our inability to adequately assess the impact of factors such as changes in the speed of claims receipt and payment, the relative magnitude or severity of claims, known outbreaks of disease such as influenza, our entry into new geographical markets, our provision of services to new populations such as the aged, blind or disabled (abd), changes to state-controlled fee schedules upon which a large proportion of our provider payments are based, modifications and upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices, and increasing medical costs. because of the complexity of our business, the number of states in which we operate, and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states, we make an overall assessment of ibnp after considering the base actuarial model reserves and the provision for adverse claims deviation.
we also include in our ibnp liability an estimate of the administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date.
the development of ibnp is a continuous process that we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims payment information becomes available. as additional information becomes known to us, we adjust our actuarial model accordingly.
on a monthly basis, we review and update our estimated ibnp and the methods used to determine that liability. any adjustments, if appropriate, are reflected in the period known. while we believe our current estimates are adequate, we have in the past been required to increase significantly our claims reserves for periods previously reported, and may be required to do so again in the future. any significant increases to prior period claims reserves would materially decrease reported earnings for the period in which the adjustment is made.
in our judgment, the estimates for completion factors will likely prove to be more accurate than trended pmpm cost estimates because estimated completion factors are subject to fewer variables in their determination. specifically, completion factors are developed over long periods of time, and are most likely to be affected by changes in claims receipt and payment experience and by provider billing practices. trended pmpm cost estimates, while affected by the same factors, will also be influenced by health care service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness, provider contract changes, changes to medicaid fee schedules, and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims. as discussed above, however, errors in estimates involving trended

pmpm costs will almost always be accompanied by errors in estimates involving completion factors, and vice versa. in such circumstances, errors in estimation involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will act to drive estimates of claims liabilities (and therefore medical care costs) in the same direction.
refer to item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, in note 11, "medical claims and benefits payable," for additional information regarding the specific factors used to determine our changes in estimates of ibnp for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
the following table presents the components of the change in our medical claims and benefits payable from continuing and discontinued operations combined for the periods indicated. the amounts presented for "components of medical care costs related to: prior periods" represent the amount by which our original estimate of medical claims and benefits payable at the beginning of the period were more than the actual amount of the liability based on information (principally the payment of claims) developed since that liability was first reported.

•   on july 27, 2014, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire family dollar in a cash and stock transaction.
•   on september 17, 2013, we entered into agreements with jp morgan chase bank to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock under a variable maturity accelerated share repurchase program, 50% of which was collared and 50% of which was uncollared.
•   on september 16, 2013, we completed a private placement with institutional investors of $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes. the senior notes include three tranches with $300 million of 4.03% senior notes due in september 2020, $350 million of 4.63% senior notes due in september 2023 and $100 million of 4.78% senior notes due in september 2025.
•   on september 13, 2013, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $2.0 billion of our common stock. this authorization replaced all previous authorizations. at january 31, 2015, we had $1.0 billion remaining under board repurchase authorization.

•   on june 6, 2012, we entered into a five-year $750.0 million unsecured credit agreement which provides for a $750.0 million revolving line of credit, including up to $150.0 million in available letters of credit. the interest rate on the facility is based, at our option, on a libor rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin.
overview our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise.  two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends.  first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions.  second, sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next.  we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales, because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared.  we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales.  the term 'expanded' also includes stores that are relocated.
at january 31, 2015, we operated 5,367 stores in 48 states and the district of columbia, and five canadian provinces, with 46.5 million selling square feet compared to 4,992 stores with 43.2 million selling square feet at february 1, 2014.  during fiscal 2014, we opened 391 stores, expanded 72 stores and closed 16 stores, compared to 343 new stores opened, 71 stores expanded and 22 stores closed during fiscal 2013.  in the current year we increased our selling square footage by 7.4%. of the 3.2 million selling square foot increase in 2014, 0.2 million was added by expanding existing stores.  the average size of our stores opened in 2014 was approximately 8,060 selling square feet (or about 10,000 gross square feet).  for 2015, we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet (or about 10,000 - 12,000 gross square feet).  we believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an ideal shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more.
fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 which ended on january 31, 2015, and february 1, 2014, respectively, each included 52 weeks. fiscal 2012 ended on february 2, 2013 and included 53 weeks, commensurate with the retail calendar. the 53rd week in 2012 added approximately $125 million in sales.
26
in fiscal 2014, comparable store net sales increased by 4.3%.  the comparable store net sales increase was the result of a 3.4% increase in the number of transactions and a 0.9% increase in average ticket.  we believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our initiatives, as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2014, and we continued the roll-out of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our stores.  at january 31, 2015 we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 3,620 stores compared to approximately 3,160 stores at february 1, 2014.  we believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers.  in addition, we accept food stamps (under the supplemental nutrition assistance program ("snap")) in approximately 5,000 qualified stores compared to 4,620 at the end of 2013.
our point-of-sale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores.  we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations.
we must continue to control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results.
pending acquisition on july 27, 2014, we executed an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement") to acquire family dollar in a cash and stock transaction (the "acquisition"). under the acquisition, which was approved by family dollar shareholders on january 22, 2015, the family dollar shareholders will receive $59.60 in cash plus no more than 0.3036 and no less than 0.2484 shares of our common stock for each share of family dollar common stock they own. on january 31, 2015, family dollar had approximately 114.5 million outstanding shares of common stock. due to the vesting of outstanding equity awards, family dollar is expected to have up to an additional 2.0 million shares of common stock outstanding at closing in connection with the acquisition. family dollar stock options and rsus will convert into options and rsus in our common stock. after the acquisition, we expect that former family dollar stockholders will own no more than 15.1% and no less than 12.7% of the outstanding shares of dollar tree common stock.
the transaction is subject to expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act ("hsr act") and satisfaction or waiver of the other customary closing conditions.
on or before closing, we expect to incur approximately $210.0 million in acquisition-related expenses, of which $75.2 million were incurred in 2014 including $33.5 million that was paid in 2014. during 2014, $28.5 million of acquisition-related expenses were recorded in "selling, general and administrative expenses" and $46.7 million related to commitment fees were recorded in "interest expense, net." we expect to incur an additional $22.6 million in commitment fees in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. we also expect to expend approximately $174.0 million in capitalizable debt issuance costs related to the financing of the acquisition.
in connection with the acquisition, we expect to pay off most of our and family dollar's existing debt, and obtain approximately $9.5 billion in bank and bond financing to recapitalize the combined company and finance the acquisition and ongoing operations. on february 23, 2015 we completed the offering of $3.25 billion of acquisition notes and on march 9, 2015 we received funding under the $3.95 billion term loan b in connection with the financing. the proceeds of the acquisition notes and term loan b are being held in escrow pending consummation of the acquisition. please see "note 11 - pending acquisition and related debt" beginning on page 61 of this form 10-k included in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for more information on the financing.
we expect to achieve approximately $300 million in annual cost savings synergies by the end of the third year after closing, and that we will incur $300 million in one-time costs to achieve those synergies. we project that the acquisition will be dilutive to earnings per share in the first twelve months following closing on a gaap basis; however, we expect it will be accretive excluding the one-time costs to achieve synergies.

fiscal year ended january 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year ended february 1, 2014
net sales.  net sales increased 9.7%, or $761.9 million, in 2014 compared to 2013, resulting from sales in our new stores and a 4.3% increase in comparable store net sales. comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones.
the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended january 31, 2015 and february 1, 2014.
january 31, 2015          february 1, 2014
new stores                          391                       343
expanded or relocated stores         72                        71
closed stores                       (16   )                   (22   )
of the 3.2 million selling square foot increase in 2014 approximately 0.2 million was added by expanding existing stores.
gross profit. gross profit margin was 35.3% in 2014 compared to 35.6% in 2013 due to increased freight costs partially offset by leverage in occupancy costs from the higher comparable store sales increase.
selling, general and administrative expenses.  selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, remained at 23.2% for 2014 compared to 2013.  excluding $28.5 million or approximately 35 basis points of expenses related to the family dollar acquisition, the selling, general and administrative rate was 22.9%. the decrease is primarily due to lower store payroll, health insurance and workers' compensation costs.
operating income.  operating income margin was 12.1% in 2014 compared to 12.4% in 2013. excluding the approximately 35 basis points of acquisition-related expenses, operating income margin was 12.4% in 2014 as lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were offset by lower gross profit margin for the reasons noted above.
interest expense, net. interest expense, net increased $64.7 million due to $46.7 million of commitment fees related to the financing of the family dollar acquisition and a full year of interest expense on the $750.0 million of senior notes issued in september 2013.
other (income) expense, net.  other (income) expense, net in 2014 increased $5.6 million primarily due to unfavorable fair market value adjustments for our diesel fuel hedges.
income taxes.  our effective tax rate was 37.2% in 2014 compared to 37.5% in 2013. the rate decrease is the result of lower state tax rates and additional work opportunity tax credits in 2014.

fiscal year ended february 1, 2014 compared to fiscal year ended february 2, 2013
net sales.  net sales increased 6.0%, or $445.8 million, in 2013 compared to 2012, resulting from sales in our new stores and a 2.4% increase in comparable store net sales. excluding the 53rd week in 2012, which accounted for approximately $125.0 million of sales, net sales increased 7.9%, or $570.8 million. the comparable store net sales increase is based on the comparable 52 weeks for both years. comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones.
the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended february 1, 2014 and february 2, 2013.
february 1, 2014          february 2, 2013
new stores                          343                       345
expanded or relocated stores         71                        87
closed stores                       (22   )                   (25   )
of the 2.7 million selling square foot increase in 2013 approximately 0.2 million was added by expanding existing stores.
gross profit. gross profit margin was 35.6% in 2013 compared to 35.9% in 2012 due to loss of leverage in occupancy and distribution cost from the 53rd week of sales in 2012.
selling, general and administrative expenses.  selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 23.2% for 2013 compared to 23.5% for 2012.  the decrease is primarily due to lower incentive compensation achievement in 2013 compared with 2012 and lower inventory service fees.
operating income.  operating income margin was 12.4% in 2013 and 2012 due to the reasons noted above.
other (income) expense, net.  other (income) expense, net in 2012 includes a $60.8 million gain on the sale of our investment in ollie's holdings, inc.
income taxes.  our effective tax rate was 37.5% in 2013 compared to 36.7% in 2012. the rate increase is the result of statute expirations and the settlement of state tax audits in 2012.
liquidity and capital resources our business requires capital to build and open new stores, expand our distribution network and operate and expand existing stores.  our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october.  historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities.

net cash provided by operating activities increased $132.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to an increase in accrued expenditures related to the family dollar acquisition and a decrease in cash used to purchase merchandise inventories.
29
net cash provided by operating activities increased $115.8 million in 2013 compared to 2012 due to a decrease in cash used for prepaid rent and purchasing merchandise inventory partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable.
net cash used in investing activities decreased $10.0 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to reduced capital expenditures, increased proceeds on fixed asset dispositions and reduced purchases of restricted investments.
net cash used in investing activities increased $63.1 million in 2013 primarily due to the impact from $62.3 million in proceeds from the sale of the investment in ollie's holdings, inc. in 2012.
in 2014, net cash used in financing activities decreased $583.2 million compared to 2013 primarily due to $1.1 billion of share repurchases and the repayment of $250.0 million in long-term debt in 2013 partially offset by the issuance of the $750.0 million of senior notes in 2013.
in 2013, net cash used in financing activities increased $294.4 million as a result of an increase in share repurchases in 2013 and the repayment of the $250.0 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility partially offset by $750.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes.
at january 31, 2015, our long-term borrowings were $757.0 million.  we also have $110.0 million, $100.0 million and $20.0 million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements, under which approximately $162.9 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at january 31, 2015.
in september 2013, we entered into a note purchase agreement with institutional accredited investors in which we issued and sold $750.0 million of senior notes (the "notes") in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933. the notes consist of three tranches: $300.0 million of 4.03% senior notes due september 16, 2020; $350.0 million of 4.63% senior notes due september 16, 2023; and $100.0 million of 4.78% senior notes due september 16, 2025. interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on january 15 and july 15 of each year. the notes are unsecured and rank pari passu in right of repayment with our other senior unsecured indebtedness. we may prepay some or all of the notes at any time in an amount not less than 5% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes to be prepaid, at a price equal to the sum of (a) 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and (b) the applicable make-whole amount. in the event of a change in control (as defined in the note purchase agreement), we may be required to prepay the notes. the note purchase agreement contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants. we used the net proceeds of the notes to finance share repurchases.
on january 20, 2015, we entered into the first amendment (the " notes amendment") to the note purchase agreement,with a majority of the noteholders party thereto. the notes amendment was entered into in connection with our pending acquisition (the "acquisition") of family dollar stores, inc. ("family dollar"). the notes amendment will, among other things, allow a newly-formed subsidiary of dollar tree to issue debt and hold the proceeds in escrow pending consummation of the acquisition (such debt, the "escrow debt"). pursuant to the terms of the notes amendment, in certain circumstances the amount of interest due on the notes may increase by 1.0% per annum. the notes amendment also contains certain negative covenants and other restrictions applicable during the period in which any escrow debt is outstanding. upon closing of the acquisition, we expect to fully repay the notes which will result in the repayment of the $750.0 million outstanding and the payment of approximately $121.2 million of prepayment fees.
in june 2012, we entered into a five-year $750.0 million unsecured credit agreement (the agreement).  the agreement provides for a $750.0 million revolving line of credit, including up to $150.0 million in available letters of credit.  the interest rate on the agreement is based, at our option, on a libor rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin.  the agreement also bears a facilities fee, calculated as a percentage, as defined, of the amount available under the line of credit, payable quarterly. the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually.  the agreement, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness.  as of january 31, 2015, no amount was outstanding under the $750.0 million revolving line of credit.
in september 2013, we amended the agreement to enable the issuance of the notes.
on august 15, 2014, we entered into an amendment (the "credit amendment") to the agreement. the credit amendment further amends the agreement to facilitate the issuance and/or borrowings of certain third-party debt financing that we may use to finance the acquisition. the credit amendment also facilitates escrow arrangements related to the acquisition.
on february 23, 2015, our wholly owned subsidiary completed the offering of $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior notes due 2020 (the "2020 notes") and $2,500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.750% senior notes
30
due 2023 (the "2023 notes", and together with the 2020 notes, the "acquisition notes"). the acquisition notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on rule 144a under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), and outside the united states, only to non-u.s. investors pursuant to regulation s under the securities act. the acquisition notes have not been registered under the securities act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the united states absent an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from registration requirements or a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the securities act or any state securities laws.
we expect to use the proceeds of the acquisition notes to finance in part the acquisition. the proceeds of the 2020 notes and the 2023 notes will be held in, and secured by liens on, separate escrow accounts with u.s. bank national association, as escrow agent (the "escrow agent"), pending consummation of the acquisition. we expect that, in connection with the consummation of the acquisition, our wholly owned subsidiary that issued the acquisition notes will merge with and into us, we will assume the obligations in respect of the acquisition notes, and the acquisition notes will be jointly and severally guaranteed on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis, subject to certain exceptions, by each of our subsidiaries that guarantees the obligations under our new senior secured credit facilities or certain other indebtedness, including family dollar and certain of its subsidiaries.
the 2020 notes, which mature on march 1, 2020, were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of february 23, 2015, with u.s. bank national association, as trustee (the "2020 notes indenture"). the 2023 notes, which mature on march 1, 2023, were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of february 23, 2015, with u.s. bank national association, as trustee (the "2023 notes indenture", and together with the 2020 notes indenture, the "indentures").
the indentures provide that if the acquisition is not consummated before august 28, 2015, if the escrow agent has not received certain additional monthly deposits by certain dates, or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the acquisition notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price of 100% of the gross proceeds of the acquisition notes offered, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption.
interest on the acquisition notes is due semiannually on march 1 and september 1 of each year, commencing on september 1, 2015. no principal is due on the acquisition notes within five years and annual interest is expected to be approximately $183.1 million.
the indentures contain covenants that, from and after the date of the acquisition, will limit our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions: (i) incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to, or purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for value, equity interests; (iii) make any principal payment on, or redeem or repurchase, subordinated debt; (iv) make loans, advances or other investments; (v) incur liens; (vi) sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; (vii) consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all assets to, another person; and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates. the indentures also provide for certain events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding acquisition notes under the applicable indenture to be declared immediately due and payable.
on march 9, 2015, our wholly owned subsidiary entered into a credit agreement, with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent, providing for $6,200 million in senior secured credit facilities (the "new senior secured credit facilities") consisting of a $1,250 million revolving credit facility (the "new revolving credit facility") and $4,950 million of term loan facilities (the "new term loan facilities"). the new term loan facilities consist of a $1,000 million term loan a tranche and a $3,950 million term loan b tranche. the new revolving credit facility and the borrowings under the term loan a tranche will mature five years after the closing of the acquisition, unless any of the 2020 notes remain outstanding as of 91 days prior to their stated maturity, in which case the new revolving credit facility and the borrowings under the term loan a tranche will mature at such time. the borrowings under the term loan b tranche will mature seven years after the closing of the acquisition. annual interest expense on the new term loan facilities is expected to approximate $197.6 million.
the proceeds of the borrowings under the term loan b tranche were deposited in an escrow account (separate from the escrow accounts related to the acquisition notes) and will be held in escrow prior to the closing of the acquisition. upon the consummation of the acquisition, we will become the borrower under the new senior secured credit facilities and will draw the term loans under the term loan a facility and will have the ability to borrow under the new revolving credit facility.
the new senior secured credit facilities will not be guaranteed by us or any of our subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the acquisition, but upon consummation of the acquisition the new senior secured credit facilities will be guaranteed by certain of our direct or indirect wholly owned u.s. subsidiaries, including family dollar and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "credit agreement guarantors"). upon the consummation of the acquisition, we expect the new
31
senior secured credit facilities will be secured by a security interest in substantially all the assets of dollar tree and the credit agreement guarantors, subject to certain exceptions.
the loans under the term loan a tranche and the new revolving credit facility will bear interest at libor plus 2.25% per annum (or a base rate plus 1.25%), and the term loan b tranche of the new senior secured credit facilities will bear interest at libor plus 3.50% per annum (or a base rate plus 2.50%). the term loan b tranche will be subject to a "libor floor" of 0.75%. the term loan a tranche of the new term loan facilities will require quarterly amortization payments of 1.25% of the original principal amount thereof in the first year following the consummation of the acquisition, 2.5% of the original principal amount thereof in the second year following the acquisition, and 3.75% of the original principal amount thereof thereafter and the term loan b tranche requires quarterly amortization payments of 0.25% of the original principal amount thereof after the closing of the acquisition. the new term loan facilities also require mandatory prepayments in connection with certain asset sales and out of excess cash flow, among other things, and subject in each case to certain significant exceptions. we expect to pay certain commitment fees in connection with the new revolving credit facility. additionally, the term loan b tranche of the new term loan facilities will require us to pay a 1.00% prepayment fee if the loans thereunder are subject to certain "repricing" transactions before march 9, 2016.
the new senior secured credit facilities contain representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants that apply, in certain circumstances, before and after the closing of the acquisition and are customary for similar financings. these include, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends, repay the acquisition notes, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with any other person. in addition, a financial maintenance covenant based on our consolidated first lien secured net leverage ratio will apply to the new revolving credit facility and the term loan a tranche of the new term loan facilities after the closing of the acquisition.
historically we have used cash to repurchase shares but we did not repurchase any shares in fiscal 2014.  we repurchased 17.4 million shares for $1,112.1 million in fiscal 2013.  we repurchased 8.1 million shares for $340.2 million in fiscal 2012.  at january 31, 2015, we have $1.0 billion remaining under board repurchase authorization.
funding requirements overview, including off-balance sheet arrangements we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2015 to total approximately $290.7 million, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre-opening costs.
our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 are between $465.0 million and $475.0 million, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores, the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 320 stores, the initial phases of work on our eleventh distribution center and the expansion of our olive branch, mississippi distribution center.  we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility.
the following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at january 31, 2015, including both on- and off-balance sheet arrangements, and our commitments, including interest on long-term borrowings (in millions):

lease financing operating lease obligations.  our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases.  the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to january 31, 2015 for stores that were not yet open on january 31, 2015.
long-term borrowings senior notes. in september 2013, we entered into a note purchase agreement with institutional accredited investors in which we issued and sold $750.0 million of senior notes (the "notes") in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933. the notes consist of three tranches: $300.0 million of 4.03% senior notes due september 16, 2020; $350.0 million of 4.63% senior notes due september 16, 2023; and $100.0 million of 4.78% senior notes due september 16, 2025. interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on january 15 and july 15 of each year. for complete terms of the notes please see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, "note 5 - long-term debt" beginning on page 54 of this form 10-k.
demand revenue bonds.  in may 1998, we entered into an agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued $19.0 million of variable-rate demand revenue bonds.  we used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition, construction and installation of land, buildings, machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch, mississippi.  the bonds did not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remained variable.  the bonds contained a demand provision and, therefore, outstanding amounts were classified as current liabilities.  in 2014, we repaid the $12.8 million outstanding under the demand revenue bonds and the debt was retired.
forgivable promissory note. in 2012, we entered into a promissory note with the state of connecticut under which the state loaned us $7.0 million in connection with our acquisition, construction and installation of land, building, machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in windsor, connecticut. if certain performance targets are met, the loan and any accrued interest will be forgiven in fiscal 2017. if the performance targets are not met, the loan and accrued interest must be repaid over a five-year period beginning in fiscal 2017.
interest on long-term borrowings.  these amounts represent interest payments on the notes, and forgivable promissory note using the interest rates for each at january 31, 2015.
commitments letters of credit and surety bonds.  we are a party to three letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements providing $110.0 million, $100.0 million and $20.0 million, respectively for letters of credit.  letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately $162.9 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at january 31, 2015.
we also have approximately $11.9 million of letters of credit outstanding for our self-insurance programs and $4.2 million of surety bonds outstanding primarily for certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores.
technology assets.  we have commitments totaling approximately $13.4 million to primarily purchase store technology assets and maintenance for our stores during 2015.
telecommunication contracts.  we have contracted for telecommunication services with contracts expiring in 2017.  the total amount of these commitments is approximately $16.8 million.
derivative financial instruments in 2014 and 2013, we were party to fuel derivative contracts with third parties which included approximately 1.6 million and 2.8 million gallons of diesel fuel, or approximately 10% and 20% of our domestic truckload fuel needs, respectively.  these derivative contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings.  we currently have fuel derivate contracts to hedge 6.6 million gallons of diesel fuel, or approximately 40% of our domestic truckload fuel needs from february 2015 through january 2016.

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates.  certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates.  following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical.
inventory valuation as discussed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, "note 1 - summary of significant account policies" under the caption "merchandise inventories" beginning on page 44 of this form 10-k, inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted-average basis.  cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis.  under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.  the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis.
inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins.  the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period.
we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal, carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans.  the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends.  historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results.
our accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends.  these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger.  our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at january 31, 2015 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2014, including the fourth quarter.  we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 10-20 basis points in our dollar tree stores for the last few years.  however, we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition.  we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent.
our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis.
accrued expenses on a monthly basis, we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred.  certain expenses, such as legal reserves, require a high degree of judgment and our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses, self-insurance costs, store-level operating expenses, such as property taxes and utilities, and certain other expenses.
we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims. our accruals, if any, related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable. we review outstanding matters with external counsel to assess the probability of an unfavorable outcome and estimates of loss. we re-evaluate outstanding proceedings and claims each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available, and we adjust or establish accruals, if necessary. our legal proceedings are described in "note 4 - commitments and contingencies" under the caption "contingencies" beginning on page 51 of this form 10-k included in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
our freight and store-level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results.  our workers' compensation, general liability and health insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted at least annually based on a review performed by a third-party actuary.  for our workers' compensation and general liability accruals, these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors. for our health insurance accrual, the actuary provides an estimate based on historical claims and claim payment timing. certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them.  the related accruals are adjusted as management's estimates change.
34
differences in management's estimates and assumptions could result in accruals which are materially different from the calculated accruals.  our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low.  historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
income taxes on a quarterly basis, we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets.  our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates, including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing, applied to the income expected to be taxed currently.  management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management's projections for future taxable income.  we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years.  historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual.
in addition, we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns.  judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws, including relevant case law, and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority.  income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded.  we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate.  for further discussion of our changes in reserves during 2014, see item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data - note 3 to the consolidated financial statements" beginning on page 48 of this form 10-k.
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, comparable store net sales, operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue.  our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including:
•   shifts in the timing of certain holidays, especially easter;
•   the timing of new store openings;
•   the net sales contributed by new stores;
•   changes in our merchandise mix; and
•   competition.
our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons.  easter was observed on march 31, 2013 and on april 20, 2014, and will be observed on april 5, 2015.  we believe that the earlier easter in 2015 could result in a $8.0 million decrease in sales in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014.  we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter.  in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months, we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff.  our operating results, particularly operating and net income, could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason, including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems, changes in consumer sentiment or inclement weather.
our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in note 12 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k.
inflation and other economic factors our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control.  consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures, including unemployment and rising fuel prices.  reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales.  national or international events, including war or terrorism, could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries.  these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs, fuel costs and other costs that are critical to our operations, such as shipping and wage rates.
shipping costs.  trans-pacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on shipping industry market conditions and fuel costs.  we can give no assurances as to the final rate trends for 2015, as we are in the early stages of our negotiations.
minimum wage. multiple states and local jurisdictions passed legislation that increase their minimum wages in 2015 and 2016 and the federal government has made indications that it may consider increasing the federal minimum wage. as a result,
35
we believe our expenses could increase unless we are able to offset the increase in payroll costs by operating more effectively or efficiently.

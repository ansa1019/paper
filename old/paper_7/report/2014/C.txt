management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary steady progress on execution priorities despite continued challenging operating environment as discussed further throughout this form 10-k, citi's 2014 results reflected a continued challenging operating environment for citi and its businesses in several respects, including:
•   the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty on the markets, trading environment and customer activity, particularly during the latter part of the year;
•   significant costs associated with legal settlements as citi resolved its significant legacy legal issues and continued to work through its outstanding legal matters;
•   uneven global economic growth; and
•   a continued low interest rate environment.
in addition, as part of its execution priorities to improve its efficiency and reduce expenses, citi incurred higher repositioning costs during the year, which also impacted its 2014 results of operations.
despite these difficult decisions and challenges, citi continued to make progress on its execution priorities in 2014, including:
•   efficient resource allocation and disciplined expense management: as noted above, citi continued to take actions to simplify and streamline the organization as well as improve productivity. as part of these efforts, citi announced strategic actions to exit its consumer businesses in certain international markets in global consumer banking (gcb) and certain businesses in institutional clients group (icg) to focus on those markets and businesses where it believes it has the greatest scale, growth potential and ability to provide meaningful returns to its shareholders.
•   wind down of citi holdings: citi continued to wind down citi holdings, including reducing its assets by $19 billion, or 16%, from year end 2013.
•   utilization of deferred tax assets (dtas): citi utilized approximately $3.3 billion in dtas during 2014 (for additional information, see "income taxes" below).
while making progress on these initiatives in 2014, citi expects the operating environment in 2015 to remain challenging. regulatory changes and requirements continue to create uncertainties for citi and its businesses. while the u.s. economy continues to improve, it remains susceptible to global events and volatility. the economic and fiscal situations of several european countries remain fragile, and geopolitical tensions in the region have added to the uncertainties. although most emerging market economies continue to grow, growth has slowed in some markets and these economies are also susceptible to outside macroeconomic events and challenges. the frequency with which legal and regulatory proceedings are initiated against financial institutions, and the severity of the remedies sought in these proceedings, has increased substantially over the past several years, including 2014. financial institutions also remain a target for an increasing number of cybersecurity attacks. for a more detailed discussion of these and other risks that could impact citi's businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2015, see each respective business' results of operations, "risk factors" and "managing global risk" below.
while citi may not be able to completely control these and other factors affecting its operating environment in 2015, it will remain focused on its execution priorities, as described above, and remains committed to achieving its 2015 financial targets for citicorp's operating efficiency ratio and citigroup's return on assets.
2014 summary results citigroup citigroup reported net income of $7.3 billion or $2.20 per diluted share, compared to $13.7 billion or $4.35 per share in 2013. in 2014, citi's results included negative $390 million (negative $240 million after-tax) of cva/dva, compared to negative $342 million (negative $213 million after-tax) in 2013 (for additional information, including citi's adoption of funding valuation adjustments, or fva, in 2014, see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements). citi's results in 2014 also included a charge of $3.8 billion ($3.7 billion after-tax) related to the mortgage settlement announced in july 2014 regarding certain of citi's legacy residential mortgage-backed securities and cdo activities, recorded in citi holdings. results in 2014 further included a tax charge of approximately $210 million related to corporate tax reforms enacted in two states, compared to a tax benefit of $176 million in 2013 related to the resolution of certain tax audit items, both recorded in corporate/other. in addition, citi's 2013 results included a net fraud loss in mexico of $360 million ($235 million after-tax) recorded in icg, and a $189 million after-tax benefit related to the divestiture of credicard, citi's non-citibank branded cards and consumer finance business in brazil (credicard), recorded in corporate/other.
excluding these items, citi reported net income of $11.5 billion in 2014, or $3.55 per diluted share, compared to $13.8 billion, or $4.37 per share, in the prior year. the 16% decrease from 2013 was driven by higher expenses, a lower net loan loss reserve release and a higher effective tax rate due primarily to non-deductible legal and related expenses incurred during the year (for additional information, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements), partially offset by increased revenues in citi holdings and a decline in net credit losses. (citi's results of operations excluding the impacts of cva/dva, the mortgage settlement, the tax items, the net fraud loss and the credicard divestiture are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding these impacts provides a more

meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.)
citi's revenues, net of interest expense, were $76.9 billion in 2014, up 1% versus the prior year. excluding cva/dva, revenues were $77.3 billion, also up 1% from 2013, as revenues rose 28% in citi holdings, partially offset by a 1% decline in citicorp. net interest revenues of $48.0 billion were 3% higher than 2013, mostly driven by lower funding costs. excluding cva/dva, non-interest revenues were $29.3 billion, down 2% from 2013, driven by lower revenues in icg and gcb in citicorp, partially offset by higher non-interest revenues in citi holdings.
expenses citigroup expenses increased 14% versus 2013 to $55.1 billion. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in 2014 and the net fraud loss in 2013, operating expenses increased 7% versus the prior year to $51.3 billion driven by higher legal and related expenses ($5.8 billion compared to $3.0 billion in the prior year) and repositioning costs ($1.6 billion compared to $590 million in the prior year).
excluding the legal and related expenses, net fraud loss in 2013, repositioning charges and the impact of foreign exchange translation into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes (fx translation), which lowered reported expenses by approximately $503 million in 2014 compared to 2013, expenses were roughly unchanged at $43.9 billion as repositioning savings, expense reductions in citi holdings and other productivity initiatives were fully offset by the impact of higher regulatory and compliance and volume-related costs. (citi's results of operations excluding the impact of legal and related expenses, repositioning charges and fx translation are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding these impacts provides a more meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.)
excluding the impact of the net fraud loss in 2013, citicorp's expenses were $47.3 billion, up 12% from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher legal and related expenses, largely in corporate/other ($4.8 billion compared to $432 million in 2013), higher repositioning costs ($1.6 billion compared to $547 million in 2013), higher regulatory and compliance costs and higher volume-related costs, partially offset by efficiency savings. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in 2014, citi holdings' expenses were $4.0 billion, down 34% from 2013, reflecting lower legal and related expenses as well as the ongoing decline in citi holdings' assets.
credit costs and allowance for loan losses citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $7.5 billion declined 12% from 2013. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in 2014, total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims declined 13% to $7.4 billion versus the prior year. net credit losses of $9.0 billion were down 14% versus the prior year. consumer net credit losses declined 15% to $8.7 billion, reflecting continued improvements in the north america mortgage portfolio within citi holdings, as well as north america citi-branded cards and citi retail services in citicorp. corporate net credit losses increased 43% to $288 million in 2014. corporate net credit losses in 2014 included approximately $113 million of incremental net credit losses related to the pemex supplier program in mexico (for additional information regarding the pemex supplier program, see "institutional clients group" below).
the net release of allowance for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments was $2.3 billion in 2014. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in 2014, the net release of allowance for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments was $2.4 billion in 2014 compared to a $2.8 billion release in the prior year. citicorp's net reserve release increased to $1.4 billion from $736 million in 2013 due to higher reserve releases in north america gcb and icg, reflecting improved credit trends. citi holdings' net reserve release, excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in 2014, decreased 53% to $958 million, primarily due to lower releases related to the north america mortgage portfolio (which also had lower net credit losses).
citigroup's total allowance for loan losses was $16.0 billion at year end, or 2.50% of total loans, compared to $19.6 billion, or 2.97%, at the end of 2013. the decline in the total allowance for loan losses reflected the continued wind down of citi holdings and overall continued improvement in the credit quality of citi's loan portfolios. the consumer allowance for loan losses was $13.6 billion, or 3.68% of total consumer loans, at year end, compared to $17.1 billion, or 4.34% of total loans, at the end of 2013. the consumer 90+ days past due delinquencies were $4.6 billion, or 1.27% of consumer loans, at year end, a decline from $5.7 billion or 1.49% of loans in the prior year. total non-accrual assets fell to $7.4 billion, a 22% reduction compared to 2013. corporate non-accrual loans declined 38% to $1.2 billion, while consumer non-accrual loans declined 17% to $5.9 billion, both reflecting the continued improvement in credit trends.
capital despite the challenging operating environment and elevated legal and related expenses during 2014, citi was able to maintain its regulatory capital, primarily through net income and the further reduction of its dtas. citigroup's basel iii tier 1 capital and common equity tier 1 capital ratios, on a fully implemented basis, were 11.5% and 10.6% as of december 31, 2014, respectively, compared to 11.3% and 10.6% as of december 31, 2013 (all based on the advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets). citigroup's estimated basel iii supplementary leverage ratio as of december 31, 2014 was 6.0% compared to 5.4% as of
5
december 31, 2013, each based on the revised final u.s. basel iii rules. for additional information on citi's capital ratios and related components, see "capital resources" below.
citicorp citicorp net income decreased 32% from the prior year to $10.7 billion. cva/dva, recorded in icg, was negative $343 million (negative $211 million after-tax) in 2014, compared to negative $345 million (negative $214 million after-tax) in the prior year (for a summary of cva/dva by business within icg, see "institutional clients group" below).
excluding cva/dva as well as the impact of the net fraud loss in mexico, the tax items and the divestiture of credicard noted above, citicorp's net income was $11.1 billion, down 29% from the prior year, as higher expenses, a higher effective tax rate and lower revenues were partially offset by continued improvement in credit costs.
citicorp revenues, net of interest expense, decreased 1% from the prior year to $71.1 billion. excluding cva/dva, citicorp revenues were $71.4 billion in 2014, also down 1% from the prior year. gcb revenues of $37.8 billion decreased 1% versus the prior year. north america gcb revenues declined 1% to $19.6 billion driven by lower retail banking revenues, partially offset by higher revenues in citi-branded cards and citi retail services. retail banking revenues declined 9% to $4.9 billion versus the prior year, primarily reflecting lower mortgage origination revenues and spread compression in the deposits portfolios, partially offset by volume-related growth and gains from branch sales during the year. citi-branded cards revenues of $8.3 billion were up 1% versus the prior year as purchase sales grew and an improvement in spreads driven by a reduction in promotional rate balances mostly offset the impact of lower average loans. citi retail services revenues increased 4% to $6.5 billion, mainly reflecting the impact of the best buy portfolio acquisition in september 2013, partially offset by continued declines in fee revenues primarily reflecting higher yields and improving credit and the resulting increase in contractual partner payments. north america gcb average deposits of $171 billion grew 3% year-over-year and average retail loans of $46 billion grew 9%. average card loans of $110 billion increased 2%, and purchase sales of $252 billion increased 5% versus the prior year. for additional information on the results of operations of north america gcb for 2014, see "global consumer banking-north america gcb" below.
international gcb revenues (consisting of emea gcb, latin america gcb and asia gcb) decreased 2% versus the prior year to $18.1 billion. excluding the impact of fx translation, international gcb revenues rose 2% from the prior year, driven by 4% growth in latin america gcb and 1% growth in asia gcb, partially offset by a 1% decline in emea gcb (for the impact of fx translation on 2014 results of operations for each of emea gcb, latin america gcb and asia gcb, see the table accompanying the discussion of each respective business' results of operations below). the growth in international gcb revenues, excluding the impact of fx translation, mainly reflected volume growth in all regions, partially offset by spread compression, the ongoing impact of regulatory changes and the repositioning of citi's franchise in korea, as well as market exits in emea gcb in 2013. for additional information on the results of operations of emea gcb, latin america gcb and asia gcb for 2014, see "global consumer banking" below. year-over-year, international gcb average deposits increased 2%, average retail loans increased 7%, investment sales increased 8%, average card loans increased 2% and card purchase sales increased 5%, all excluding the impact of credicard's results in the prior year period and fx translation.
icg revenues were $33.3 billion in 2014, down 1% from the prior year. excluding cva/dva, icg revenues were $33.6 billion, also down 1% from the prior year. banking revenues of $17.0 billion, excluding cva/dva and the impact of mark-to-market gains/(losses) on hedges related to accrual loans within corporate lending (see below), increased 5% from the prior year, primarily reflecting growth in investment banking, corporate lending and private bank revenues. investment banking revenues increased 7% versus the prior year, driven by an 11% increase in advisory revenues to $949 million and an 18% increase in equity underwriting to $1.2 billion. debt underwriting revenues of $2.5 billion were largely unchanged from 2013. private bank revenues, excluding cva/dva, increased 7% to $2.7 billion from the prior year, driven by increased client volumes and growth in investment and capital markets products, partially offset by spread compression. corporate lending revenues rose 52% to $1.9 billion, including $116 million of mark-to-market gains on hedges related to accrual loans compared to a $287 million loss in the prior year. excluding the mark-to-market impact on hedges related to accrual loans in both periods, corporate lending revenues rose 15% versus the prior year to $1.7 billion, primarily reflecting growth in average loans and improved funding costs. treasury and trade solutions revenues increased by 1% versus the prior year to $7.9 billion as volume and fee growth was largely offset by the impact of spread compression globally.
markets and securities services revenues of $16.5 billion, excluding cva/dva, decreased 8% from the prior year. fixed income markets revenues of $11.8 billion, excluding cva/dva, decreased 11% from the prior year, reflecting weakness across rates and currencies, credit markets and municipals due to challenging trading conditions, partially offset by increased securitized products and commodities revenues. the first half of 2013 included a strong performance in rates and currencies, driven in part by the impact of quantitative easing globally. equity markets revenues of $2.8 billion, excluding cva/dva, declined 1% versus the prior year, mostly reflecting weakness in cash equities in emea driven by volatility in europe, partially offset by strength in prime finance. securities services revenues of $2.3 billion increased 3% versus the prior year primarily due to increased volumes, assets under custody and overall client activity. for additional information on the results of operations of icg for 2014, see "institutional clients group" below.
corporate/other revenues decreased to $47 million from $121 million in the prior year, driven mainly by lower revenues from sales of available-for-sale securities as well as hedging activities. for additional information on the results of

operations of corporate/other in 2014, see "corporate/other" below.
citicorp end-of-period loans were roughly unchanged at $572 billion, with 1% growth in corporate loans offset by a 2% decline in consumer loans. excluding the impact of fx translation, citicorp loans grew 3%, with 4% growth in corporate loans and 2% growth in consumer loans.
citi holdings citi holdings' net loss was $3.4 billion in 2014 compared to a net loss of $1.9 billion in 2013. cva/dva was negative $47 million (negative $29 million after-tax) in 2014, compared to positive $3 million (positive $1 million after-tax) in the prior year. excluding the impact of cva/dva and the mortgage settlement in 2014, citi holdings' net income was $385 million, reflecting lower expenses, higher revenues and lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release.
citi holdings' revenues increased 27% to $5.8 billion from the prior year. excluding cva/dva, citi holdings' revenues increased 28% to $5.9 billion from the prior year. net interest revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, largely driven by lower funding costs. non-interest revenues, excluding cva/dva, increased 68% to $2.3 billion from the prior year, primarily driven by higher gains on assets sales and the absence of repurchase reserve builds for representation and warranty claims in 2014. for additional information on the results of operations of citi holdings in 2014, see "citi holdings" below.
citi holdings' assets were $98 billion, 16% below the prior year, and represented approximately 5% of citi's total gaap assets and 14% of its risk-weighted assets under basel iii as of year end (based on the advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets).

global consumer banking global consumer banking (gcb) consists of citigroup's four geographical consumer banking businesses that provide traditional banking services to retail customers through retail banking, commercial banking, citi-branded cards and citi retail services (for additional information on these businesses, see "citigroup segments" above). gcb is a globally diversified business with 3,280 branches in 35 countries around the world as of december 31, 2014. for the year ended december 31, 2014, gcb had $399 billion of average assets and $331 billion of average deposits.
gcb's overall strategy is to leverage citi's global footprint and seek to be the preeminent bank for the emerging affluent and affluent consumers in large urban centers. in credit cards and in certain retail markets, citi serves customers in a somewhat broader set of segments and geographies.
consistent with its strategy to continue to optimize its branch footprint and further concentrate its presence in major metropolitan areas, during 2014, citi announced that it intends to exit its consumer businesses in the following markets: costa rica, el salvador, guatemala, nicaragua, panama and peru (in latin america); japan, guam and its consumer finance business in korea (in asia); and the czech republic, egypt and hungary (in emea). citi expects to substantially complete its exit from these businesses by the end of 2015. these consumer businesses, consisting of $28 billion of assets, $7 billion of consumer loans and $3 billion of deposits (excluding approximately $21 billion of deposits reclassified to held-for-sale as a result of citi's agreement in december 2014 to sell its japan retail banking business) as of december 31, 2014, contributed approximately $1.6 billion of revenues, $1.4 billion of expenses and a net loss of $40 million in 2014, with the loss primarily attributable to repositioning and other actions directly related to the exit plans. these businesses will be reported as part of citi holdings beginning in the first quarter of 2015. for additional information, see "executive summary" above and "latin america gcb" and "asia gcb" below.

2014 vs. 2013
net income increased by 13% due to lower net credit losses, higher loan loss reserve releases and lower expenses, partially offset by lower revenues.
revenues decreased 1%, with lower revenues in retail banking, partially offset by higher revenues in citi-branded cards and citi retail services. net interest revenue increased 3% primarily due to an increase in average loans in citi retail services driven by the best buy portfolio acquisition in september 2013 and continued volume growth in retail banking, which more than offset lower average loans in citi-branded cards. non-interest revenue decreased 22%, driven by lower mortgage origination revenues due to significantly lower u.s. mortgage refinancing activity and a continued decline in revenues in citi retail services, primarily reflecting improving credit and the resulting impact on contractual partner payments, partially offset by a 5% increase in total card purchase sales to $252 billion and gains during the year from branch sales (approximately $130 million).
retail banking revenues of $4.9 billion decreased 9% due to the lower mortgage origination revenues and spread compression in the deposit portfolios, which began to abate during the latter part of the year, partially offset by continued volume-related growth and the gains from branch sales. consistent with gcb's strategy, during 2014, na gcb closed or sold over 130 branches (a 14% decline from the prior year), with announced plans to sell or close an additional 60 branches in early 2015. average loans of $46 billion increased 9% and average deposits of $171 billion increased 3%.
cards revenues increased 2% as average loans of $110 billion increased 3% versus 2013. in citi-branded cards, revenues increased 1% as a 4% increase in purchase sales and higher net interest spreads, driven by the continued reduction of promotional balances in the portfolio, mostly offset lower average loans (3% decline from 2013). the decline in average loans was driven primarily by the reduction in promotional balances, and to a lesser extent, increased customer payment rates during the year. in addition, while the business experienced modest full rate loan growth during 2014, growth in full rate loan balances began to slow during the latter part of the year. combined with the continued reduction in promotional balances, na gcb could experience pressure on full rate loan growth during 2015.
citi retail services revenues increased 4% primarily due to a 12% increase in average loans driven by the best buy acquisition, partially offset by continued declines in fee revenues primarily reflecting higher yields and improving credit and the resulting increase in contractual partner payments. citi retail services revenues also benefited from lower funding costs, partially offset by a decline in net interest spreads due to a higher percentage of promotional balances within the portfolio. purchase sales in citi retail services increased 7% from 2013, driven by the acquisition of the best buy portfolio.
with respect to both cards portfolios, as widely publicized, u.s. gas prices declined during 2014, particularly in the fourth quarter. the decline in gas prices has negatively impacted purchase sales in the fuel portfolios, particularly in citi retail services, and consumer savings from lower gas prices may not result in higher spending in other spend categories. na gcb will continue to monitor trends in this area going into 2015.
expenses decreased 2% as ongoing cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by higher repositioning charges, increased investment spending and an increase in citi retail services expenses due to the impact of the best buy portfolio acquisition. cost reduction initiatives included the ongoing repositioning of the mortgage business due to the decline in mortgage refinancing activity, as well as continued rationalization of the branch footprint, including reducing the number of overall branches, as discussed above.
provisions decreased 18% due to lower net credit losses (9%) and higher loan loss reserve releases (21%). net credit losses declined in citi-branded cards (down 14% to $2.2 billion) and in citi retail services (down 2% to $1.9 billion). the loan loss reserve release increased to $1.2 billion due to the continued improvement in citi-branded cards, partially offset by a lower loan loss reserve release in citi retail services due to reserve builds for new loans originated in the best buy portfolio. given the improvement in credit within the cards portfolios during 2014, na gcb would not expect to see similar levels of loan loss reserve releases in 2015.
2013 vs. 2012
net income decreased 14%, mainly driven by lower revenues and lower loan loss reserve releases, partially offset by lower net credit losses and expenses.
revenues decreased 6% primarily due to lower retail banking revenues. the decline in retail banking revenues was primarily due to lower mortgage origination revenues driven by the significantly lower u.s. mortgage refinancing activity and ongoing spread compression in the deposit portfolios, partially offset by growth in average deposits, average commercial loans and average retail loans.
cards revenues increased 1%. in citi-branded cards, revenues were unchanged as continued improvement in net interest spreads, reflecting higher yields as promotional balances represented a smaller percentage of the portfolio total as well as lower funding costs, were offset by a decline in average loans. citi retail services revenues increased 3% primarily due to the acquisition of the best buy portfolio, partially offset by improving credit and the resulting impact on contractual partner payments.
expenses decreased 3%, primarily due to lower legal and related costs and repositioning savings, partially offset by higher mortgage origination costs and expenses in cards as a result of the best buy portfolio acquisition.
provisions increased 7%, as lower net credit losses in the citi-branded cards and citi retail services portfolios were offset by lower loan loss reserve releases ($1.0 billion in 2013 compared to $2.4 billion in 2012), primarily related to cards, as well as reserve builds for new loans originated in the best buy portfolio.

the discussion of the results of operations for emea gcb below excludes the impact of fx translation for all periods presented. presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of fx translation, are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of emea gcb's results excluding the impact of fx translation is a more meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of the business. for a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
2014 vs. 2013
net income declined $58 million to a net loss of $27 million as higher credit costs and lower revenues were partially offset by lower expenses.
revenues decreased 1%, driven by lower revenues resulting from the sales of citi's consumer operations in turkey and romania during 2013, spread compression and the absence of the prior-year gain related to the turkey sale, largely offset by volume growth. net interest revenue was roughly unchanged as spread compression was offset by growth in average retail loans. non-interest revenue decreased 4%, mainly reflecting lower revenues due to the sales of the consumer operations in turkey and romania, partially offset by higher investment fees due to increased sales of higher spread investment products.
retail banking revenues increased 2%, primarily due to increases in investment sales (3%), average deposits (5%) and average retail loans (11%), partially offset by the impact of the sales of the consumer operations in turkey and romania. cards revenues declined 6%, primarily due to spread compression, interest rate caps, particularly in poland, and the impact of the sales of the consumer operations in turkey and romania. continued regulatory changes, including caps on interchange rates in poland, and spread compression will likely continue to negatively impact revenues in emea gcb in 2015.
expenses decreased 1%, primarily due to the impact of the sales of the consumer operations in turkey and romania and efficiency savings, which were largely offset by higher repositioning charges, continued investment spending on new internal operating platforms and volume-related expenses.
provisions increased 98% to $87 million driven by a loan loss reserve build mainly related to citi's consumer business in russia due to the ongoing economic situation in russia (as discussed below), partially offset by a 1% decline in net credit losses.
russia citi's ability to grow its consumer business in russia has been negatively impacted by actions citi has taken to mitigate its risks and exposures in response to the ongoing political instability, such as limiting its exposure to additional credit risk. in addition, the ongoing economic situation in russia, coupled with consumer overleveraging in the market, has negatively impacted consumer credit, particularly delinquencies in the russian card and personal installment loan portfolios (which totaled $1.2 billion as of december 31, 2014, or 0.4% of total gcb loans), and citi currently expects these trends could continue into 2015. citi has taken these trends into consideration in determining its allowance for loan loss reserves. any further actions citi may take to mitigate its exposures or risks, or the imposition of additional sanctions (such as asset freezes) involving russia or against russian entities, business sectors, individuals or otherwise, could further negatively impact the results of operations of emea gcb. for additional information on citi's exposures in russia, see "managing global risk-country and cross-border risk" below.
2013 vs. 2012
net income of $31 million compared to a net loss of $56 million in 2012 as lower expenses and lower net credit losses were partially offset by lower revenues, primarily due to the impact of the sales of citi's consumer operations in turkey and romania.
revenues decreased 2%, mainly driven by the lower revenues resulting from the sales of the consumer operations in turkey and romania, partially offset by higher volumes in core markets and a gain related to the turkey sale.
retail banking revenues decreased 1%, driven by the sales of the consumer operations in turkey and romania, partially offset by increases in average deposits (1%) and average retail loans (13%) as well as the gain related to the turkey sale. cards revenues declined 4%, primarily due to spread compression and interest rate caps, particularly in poland, and an 8% decrease in average cards loans, primarily due to the sales of the consumer operations in turkey and romania.
expenses declined 6%, primarily due to repositioning savings as well as lower repositioning charges, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses and continued investment spending on new internal operating platforms.
provisions declined 53% due to a 37% decrease in net credit losses largely resulting from the impact of the sales of the consumer operations in turkey and romania and a net credit recovery in the second quarter 2013.

the discussion of the results of operations for latin america gcb below excludes the impact of fx translation for all periods presented. presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of fx translation, are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of latin america gcb's results excluding the impact of fx translation is a more meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of the business. for a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
2014 vs. 2013
net income decreased 3% as higher expenses and credit costs were partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 4%, primarily due to volume growth and spread and fee growth in mexico, partially offset by continued spread compression in the region and slower overall economic growth in certain latin america markets, including mexico and brazil. net interest revenue increased 4% due to increased volumes and stable spreads in mexico, partially offset by the ongoing spread compression in other latin america markets. non-interest revenue increased 3%, primarily due to higher fees from increased volumes in retail banking and cards.
retail banking revenues increased 3% as average loans increased 6%, investment sales increased 19% and average deposits increased 6%, partially offset by lower spreads in brazil and colombia. cards revenues increased 6% as average loans increased 5% and purchase sales increased 1%, excluding the impact of credicard's results in the prior year period (for additional information, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). the increase in cards revenues was partially offset by lower economic growth and slowing cards purchase sales in mexico due to the previously disclosed fiscal reforms enacted in 2013 in mexico, which included, among other things, higher income and other taxes that negatively impacted consumer behavior and spending. citi expects these trends, as well as spread compression, could continue to negatively impact revenues in latin america gcb in 2015.
expenses increased 5%, primarily due to mandatory salary increases in certain countries, higher legal and related costs, increased repositioning charges and higher technology spending, partially offset by productivity and repositioning savings.
provisions increased 7%, primarily due to higher net credit losses, which were partially offset by a lower loan loss reserve build. net credit losses increased 22%, driven by portfolio growth and continued seasoning in the mexico cards portfolio. net credit losses were also impacted by both the slower economic growth and fiscal reforms in mexico (as discussed above) as well as a $71 million charge-off in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to citi's homebuilder exposure in mexico, which was offset by a related release of previously established loan loss reserves and thus neutral to the cost of credit. the continued impact of the fiscal reforms and economic slowdown in mexico is likely to cause net credit losses in latin america gcb to remain elevated.
argentina/venezuela for additional information on citi's exposures in argentina and venezuela and the potential impact to latin america gcb results of operations as a result of certain developments in these countries, see "managing global risk-country and cross-border risk" below.
2013 vs. 2012
net income decreased 9% as higher credit costs, higher expenses and a higher effective tax rate were partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 7%, primarily due to volume growth in retail banking and cards, partially offset by spread compression. retail banking revenues increased 5% as average loans increased 12%, investment sales increased 13% and average deposits increased 2%. cards revenues increased 10% as average loans increased 10% and purchase sales increased 12%, excluding the impact of credicard's results.
expenses increased 3% due to increased volume-related costs, mandatory salary increases in certain countries and higher regulatory costs, partially offset by lower repositioning charges and higher repositioning savings.
provisions increased 25%, primarily due to higher net credit losses as well as a higher loan loss reserve build. net credit losses increased 25%, primarily in the mexico cards and personal loan portfolios, reflecting both volume growth and portfolio seasoning. the loan loss reserve build increased 52%, primarily due to an increase in reserves in mexico related to the top three mexican homebuilders, with the remainder due to portfolio growth and seasoning and the impact of potential losses related to hurricanes in the region during september 2013.

the discussion of the results of operations for asia gcb below excludes the impact of fx translation for all periods presented. presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of fx translation, are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of asia gcb's results excluding the impact of fx translation is a more meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of the business. for a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
2014 vs. 2013
net income decreased 9%, primarily due to higher expenses, partially offset by lower credit costs and higher revenues.
revenues increased 1%, as higher non-interest revenue was partially offset by a decline in net interest revenue. non-interest revenue increased 5%, primarily driven by higher fee revenues (largely due to the previously disclosed distribution agreement that commenced during the first quarter of 2014), partially offset by a decline in investment sales revenues. net interest revenue declined 2%, driven by the ongoing impact of regulatory changes, continued spread compression and the repositioning of the franchise in korea.
retail banking revenues increased 2%, due to the higher insurance fee revenues, partially offset by lower investment sales revenues and the repositioning of the franchise in korea. investment sales revenues decreased 2%, due to weaker investor sentiment reflecting overall market trends and strong prior year performance, particularly in the first half of 2013. citi expects investment sales revenues will continue to reflect the overall capital markets environment in the region, including seasonal trends. average retail deposits increased 1% (2% excluding korea) and average retail loans increased 7% (9% excluding korea).
cards revenues decreased 1%, due to the impact of regulatory changes, particularly in korea, indonesia and singapore, spread compression and customer deleveraging, largely offset by a 2% increase in average loans and a 5% increase (8% excluding korea) in purchase sales driven by growth in china, india, singapore and hong kong.
while repositioning in korea continued to have a negative impact on year-over-year revenue comparisons in asia gcb, revenues in korea largely stabilized in the second half of 2014. citi expects spread compression and regulatory changes in several markets across the region will continue to have a negative impact on asia gcb revenues in 2015.
expenses increased 9%, primarily due to higher repositioning charges in korea, investment spending and volume-related growth, partially offset by higher efficiency savings.
provisions decreased 17%, primarily due to higher loan loss reserve releases. overall credit quality remained stable across the region during 2014.
2013 vs. 2012
net income decreased 12%, primarily due to a higher effective tax rate and lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses.
revenues decreased 1%, as lower net interest revenue was partially offset by higher non-interest revenue. net interest revenue declined 5%, primarily driven by spread compression and the repositioning of the franchise in korea. non-interest revenue increased 7%, mainly driven by growth in investment sales volume, despite a decrease in volumes in the second half of the year due to investor sentiment, reflecting overall market uncertainty. retail banking revenues decreased 3%, primarily driven by spread compression and the impact of regulatory changes, partially offset by a 12% increase in investment sales revenues. cards revenues increased 2%, as cards purchase sales increased 7% with growth across the region, partially offset by the continued impact of regulatory changes and customer deleveraging.
expenses declined 3%, as lower repositioning charges and efficiency and repositioning savings were partially offset by increased investment spending, particularly in china cards.
provisions increased 4%, reflecting a higher loan loss reserve build due to volume growth in china, hong kong, india and singapore as well as regulatory requirements in korea, partially offset by lower net credit losses.

institutional clients group institutional clients group (icg) provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, private banking, cash management, trade finance and securities services. icg transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.
icg revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. icg earns fee income for assisting clients in clearing transactions, providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. revenue generated from these activities is recorded in commissions and fees and investment banking. in addition, as a market maker, icg facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. these price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in principal transactions. interest income earned on inventory and loans held less interest paid to customers on deposits is recorded as net interest revenue. revenue is also generated from transaction processing and assets under custody and administration.
icg's international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in over 95 countries and jurisdictions. at december 31, 2014, icg had approximately $1.0 trillion of assets and $559 billion of deposits, while two of its businesses, securities services and issuer services, managed approximately $16.2 trillion of assets under custody compared to $14.3 trillion at the end of 2013.
as previously announced, citi intends to exit certain businesses in icg, including hedge fund services within securities services, the prepaid cards business in treasury and trade solutions, certain transfer agency operations and wealth management administration. these businesses, consisting of approximately $4 billion of assets and deposits as of december 31, 2014, contributed approximately $460 million of revenues, $600 million of operating expenses and a net loss of $80 million in 2014, with roughly half of the pre-tax loss primarily attributable to repositioning and other actions directly related to the exit plans. these businesses will be reported as part of citi holdings beginning in the first quarter of 2015. for additional information, see "executive summary" above.

the discussion of the results of operations for icg below excludes the impact of cva/dva for all periods presented. presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of cva/dva and the impact of gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans, are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of icg's results excluding the impact of these items is a more meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of the business. for a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
2014 vs. 2013
net income increased 1%, primarily driven by lower expenses and lower credit costs, largely offset by lower revenues. excluding the impact of the net fraud loss in 2013 (see "executive summary" above), net income decreased 1%, primarily driven by the lower revenues and higher expenses, largely offset by the lower credit costs.
•   revenues decreased 1%, reflecting lower revenues in markets and securities services (decrease of 8%), partially offset by higher revenues in banking (increase of 7%, 5% excluding the gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans). citi expects revenues in icg, particularly in its markets and securities services businesses, will likely continue to reflect the overall market environment.
within banking:
•   investment banking revenues increased 7%, reflecting a stronger overall market environment and improved wallet share with icg's target clients, partially offset by a modest decline in overall wallet share. the decline in overall wallet share was primarily driven by equity and debt underwriting and reflected market fragmentation. advisory revenues increased 11%, reflecting the increased target client activity and an expansion of the overall m&amp;a market. equity underwriting revenues increased 18% largely in line with overall growth in market fees. debt underwriting revenues were largely unchanged.
•   treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 1%, as continued higher deposit balances, fee growth and trade activity were partially offset by the impact of spread compression globally. end-of-period deposit balances were unchanged, but increased 3% excluding the impact of fx translation, largely driven by north america. average trade loans decreased 9% (7% excluding the impact of fx translation), as the business maintained origination volumes while reducing lower spread assets and increasing asset sales to optimize returns (see "balance sheet review" below).
•   corporate lending revenues increased 52%. excluding the impact of gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans, revenues increased 15%, primarily due to continued growth in average loan balances and lower funding costs. (for information on citi's corporate credit exposure to the energy sector, see "managing global risk-credit risk-corporate credit details" below.)
•   private bank revenues increased 7% due to growth in client business volumes and improved spreads in banking, higher capital markets activity and an increase in assets under management in managed investments, partially offset by continued spread compression in lending.
within markets and securities services:
•   fixed income markets revenues decreased 11%, driven by a decrease in rates and currencies revenues, partially offset by increased securitized products and commodities revenues. rates and currencies revenues declined due to historically muted levels of volatility, uncertainties around russia and greece and lower client activity in the first half of 2014. in addition, the first half of 2013 included a strong performance in rates and currencies, driven in part by the impact of quantitative easing globally. municipals and credit markets revenues declined due to challenging trading conditions resulting from macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2014. these declines were partially offset by increased securitized products and commodities revenues, largely in north america.
•   equity markets revenues decreased 1%, primarily reflecting weakness in emea, particularly cash equities, driven by volatility in europe, largely offset by improved performance in prime finance due to increased customer flows.
•   securities services revenues increased 3% due to increased volumes, assets under custody and overall client activity.
expenses decreased 1%, as efficiency savings, the absence of the net fraud loss in 2014 and lower performance-based compensation was partially offset by higher repositioning charges and legal and related expenses as well as increased regulatory and compliance costs. excluding the impact of the net fraud loss, expenses increased 1%, as higher repositioning charges and legal and related expenses as well as increased regulatory and compliance costs were partially offset by efficiency savings and lower performance-based compensation.
provisions decreased 27%, primarily reflecting an improvement in the provision for unfunded lending commitments in the corporate loan portfolio, partially offset by higher net credit losses and a lower loan loss reserve release driven by the overall economic environment. net credit losses increased 52%, largely related to the petróleos mexicanos (pemex) supplier program in the first quarter of 2014 (for additional information, see citi's form 8-k filed with the sec on february 28, 2014) as well as write-offs related to a specific counterparty. for information on certain legal and regulatory matters related to the pemex supplier program, see note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.
russia citi continues to monitor and manage its exposures in icg resulting from the instability in russia and ukraine. as discussed above, the ongoing uncertainties created by the instability in the region have impacted markets in the region, including certain of citi's markets businesses, and could
25
continue to do so in the future. any actions citi may take to mitigate its exposures or risks, or the imposition of additional sanctions (such as asset freezes) involving russia or against russian entities, business sectors, individuals or otherwise, could negatively impact the results of operations of emea icg. for additional information on citi's exposures in these countries, see "managing global risk-country and cross-border risk" below.
2013 vs. 2012
net income increased 3%, primarily driven by higher revenues and lower expenses and credit costs, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.
•   revenues increased 2%, primarily reflecting higher revenues in banking (increase of 4%, 1% excluding the gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans) and in markets and securities services (increase of 1%).
within banking:
•   investment banking revenues increased 8%, reflecting gains in overall investment banking wallet share. advisory revenues increased 19%, reflecting an improvement in wallet share, despite a contraction in the overall m&amp;a market wallet. equity underwriting revenues increased 45%, driven by improved wallet share and increased market activity, particularly initial public offerings. debt underwriting revenues decreased 6%, primarily due to lower bond underwriting fees and a decline in wallet share during the year.
•   treasury and trade solutions revenues decreased 3%, as the ongoing impact of spread compression globally was partially offset by higher balances and fee growth. average deposits increased 7% and average trade loans increased 22%, including the impact of the consolidation of approximately $7 billion of trade loans during the second quarter of 2013.
•   corporate lending revenues increased 40%. excluding the impact of gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans, revenues decreased 4%, primarily due to increased hedge premium costs and moderately lower loan balances, partially offset by higher spreads.
•   private bank revenues increased 4%, with growth across all regions and products, particularly in managed investments, where growth reflected both higher client assets under management and increased placement fees, as well as in capital markets. revenue growth in lending and deposits, primarily driven by growth in client volumes, was partially offset by continued spread compression.
within markets and securities services:
•   fixed income markets revenues decreased 7%, primarily reflecting industry-wide weakness in rates and currencies, partially offset by strong performance in credit-related and securitized products and commodities. rates and currencies performance was lower compared to a strong 2012 that benefited from increased client revenues and a more liquid market environment, particularly in emea. 2013 results also reflected a general slowdown in client activity exacerbated by uncertainty around the tapering of quantitative easing as well as geopolitical issues. credit-related and securitized products results reflected increased client activity driven by improved market conditions and demand for spread products.
•   equity markets revenues increased 24%, primarily due to market share gains, continued improvement in cash and derivative trading performance and a more favorable market environment.
•   securities services revenues increased 3%, as settlement volumes increased 15% and assets under custody increased 8%, partially offset by spread compression related to deposits.
expenses decreased 2%, primarily reflecting repositioning savings, the impact of lower performance-based compensation, lower repositioning charges and the impact of fx translation, partially offset by the net fraud loss in 2013 as well as higher legal and related costs and volume-related expenses. excluding the impact of the net fraud loss, expenses decreased 4%, primarily reflecting repositioning savings, the impact of lower performance-based compensation, lower repositioning charges and the impact of fx translation, partially offset by higher legal and related costs and volume-related expenses.
provisions decreased 72%, primarily reflecting higher loan loss reserve releases and lower net credit losses.

2014 vs. 2013
the net loss increased $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion, primarily due to higher legal and related expenses.
revenues decreased 61%, primarily driven by lower revenues from sales of available-for-sale (afs) securities as well as hedging activities.
expenses increased $5.1 billion to $6.1 billion, largely driven by the higher legal and related expenses ($4.4 billion compared to $172 million in 2013) as well as increased regulatory and compliance costs and higher repositioning charges.
2013 vs. 2012
the net loss decreased $747 million to $444 million, primarily due to lower expenses and the $189 million after-tax benefit from the sale of credicard, partially offset by a lower tax benefit.
revenues decreased $7 million, driven by lower revenue from sales of afs securities in 2013, partially offset by higher revenues from debt repurchases and hedging gains.
expenses decreased 54%, largely driven by lower legal and related costs and repositioning charges.

citi holdings citi holdings contains businesses and portfolios of assets that citigroup has determined are not central to its core citicorp businesses. consistent with this determination, as previously announced, beginning in the first quarter of 2015, citi's consumer operations in 11 markets, as well as the consumer finance business in korea, and certain businesses in icg, will be reported as part of citi holdings (see "executive summary," "global consumer banking" and "institutional clients group" above).
as of december 31, 2014, citi holdings assets were approximately $98 billion, a decrease of 16% year-over-year and 5% from september 30, 2014. the decline in assets of $5 billion from september 30, 2014 primarily consisted of divestitures and run-off. as of december 31, 2014, consumer assets in citi holdings were approximately $87 billion, or approximately 89% of citi holdings assets. of the consumer assets, approximately $59 billion, or 68%, consisted of north america mortgages (residential first mortgages and home equity loans), including consumer mortgages originated by citi's legacy citifinancial north america business (approximately $10 billion, or 17%, of the $59 billion as of december 31, 2014). as of december 31, 2014, citi holdings represented approximately 5% of citi's gaap assets and 14% of its risk-weighted assets under basel iii (based on the advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets).

the discussion of the results of operations for citi holdings below excludes the impact of cva/dva for all periods presented. presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of cva/dva, are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of citi holdings' results excluding the impact of cva/dva is a more meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of the business. for a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
2014 vs. 2013
the net loss increased by $1.4 billion to $3.3 billion, largely due to the impact of the mortgage settlement in july 2014 (see "executive summary" above), partially offset by higher revenues and lower cost of credit. excluding the mortgage settlement, net income increased by $2.3 billion to $385 million, primarily due to lower expenses, higher revenues and lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release.
revenues increased 28%, primarily driven by gains on asset sales, including the sales of the consumer operations in greece and spain in the third quarter of 2014, lower funding costs and the absence of residential mortgage repurchase reserve builds for representation and warranty claims in 2014, partially offset by losses on the redemption of debt associated with funding citi holdings assets.
expenses increased 29%, principally reflecting higher legal and related costs ($4.7 billion compared to $2.6 billion in 2013) due to the mortgage settlement, partially offset by lower expenses driven by the ongoing decline in assets. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, expenses declined 34%, primarily driven by lower legal and related costs ($986 million compared to $2.6 billion in 2013) as well as the ongoing decline in assets.
provisions decreased 18%, driven by lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loss reserve release. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, provisions declined 22%, driven by a 46% decline in net credit losses primarily due to continued improvements in north america mortgages and overall lower asset levels. the net reserve release decreased 56% to $903 million, primarily due to lower releases related to the north america mortgage portfolio, partially offset by lower losses on asset sales. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, the net reserve release decreased 53%. loan loss reserves related to the north america mortgage portfolio were utilized to nearly fully offset net credit losses in the portfolio in 2014.
2013 vs. 2012
the net loss decreased by 71% to $1.9 billion. 2012 included the pretax loss of $4.7 billion ($2.9 billion after-tax) related to the sale of the morgan stanley smith barney joint venture (mssb) to morgan stanley. excluding the mssb loss, the net loss decreased to $1.9 billion from a net loss of $3.8 billion in 2012, due to significantly lower provisions for credit losses and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses.
revenues increased to $4.6 billion, primarily due to the absence of the mssb loss. excluding the mssb loss, revenues increased 23%, primarily driven by lower funding costs and lower residential mortgage repurchase reserve builds for representation and warranty claims ($470 million, compared to $700 million in 2012).
expenses increased 13%, primarily due to higher legal and related costs ($2.6 billion in 2013 compared to
$1.2 billion in 2012), driven largely by legacy private-label securitization and other mortgage-related issues, partially offset by lower overall assets. excluding legal and related costs, expenses declined 18% versus 2012.
provisions decreased 66%, driven by the absence of incremental net credit losses relating to the national mortgage settlement and those required by office of the comptroller of the currency (occ) guidance during 2012 (for additional information, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements), as well as improved credit in north america mortgages and overall lower asset levels. loan loss reserve releases increased 27% to $2 billion, which included a loan loss reserve release of approximately $2.2 billion related to the north america mortgage portfolio, partially offset by losses on asset sales.
japan consumer finance in 2008, citi decided to exit its japan consumer finance business and has liquidated approximately 95% of the portfolio since that time. as of december 31, 2014, citi's japan consumer finance business had approximately $151 million in outstanding loans that currently charge or have previously charged interest rates in the "gray zone" (interest at rates that are legal but may not be enforceable and thus may subject citi to customer refund claims), compared to approximately $278 million as of december 31, 2013. although the portfolio has largely been liquidated, citi could be subject to refund claims on previously outstanding loans that charged gray zone interest and thus could be subject to losses on loans in excess of these amounts.
at december 31, 2014, citi's reserves related to customer refunds in the japan consumer finance business were $442 million, compared to $434 million at december 31, 2013. the increase in the total reserve year-over-year primarily resulted from net reserve builds in 2014 ($248 million compared to $28 million in 2013) due to less than expected declines in customer refund claims, partially offset by payments made to customers and a continuing reduction in the population of current and former customers who are eligible to make refund claims.
citi continues to monitor and evaluate trends and developments relating to the charging of gray zone interest, including customer defaults, refund claims and litigation, and financial, legislative, regulatory, judicial and other political developments, as well as the potential impact to both currently and previously outstanding loans in this legacy business and its reserves related thereto. citi could be subject to additional losses as a result of these developments and the impact on citi is subject to uncertainty and continues to be difficult to predict.

assets cash and deposits with banks cash and deposits with banks decreased from the prior-year period as citi continued to grow its investment portfolio to manage its interest rate position and deploy its excess liquidity. average cash balances were $182 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $204 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.
federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos)
the decline in reverse repos and securities borrowing transactions from the prior-year period was due to the impact of fx translation and continued optimization of citi's secured lending (for additional information, see "managing global risk-market risk-funding and liquidity risk"
below), partially offset by increased short trading in the markets and securities services businesses within icg.
trading account assets trading account assets increased from the prior-year period, as increased market volatility, particularly in rates and currencies within markets and securities services within icg, increased the carrying value of citi's derivatives positions. average trading account assets were $309 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $292 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.
investments the increase in investments year-over-year reflected citi's continued deployment of its excess cash (as discussed above) by investing in available-for-sale securities, particularly in u.s. treasuries.

loans the impact of fx translation on citi's reported loans was a negative $17 billion versus the prior-year period and negative $10 billion sequentially.
excluding the impact of fx translation, citi's loans decreased 1% from the prior-year period, as 3% loan growth in citicorp was offset by the continued declines in citi holdings. consumer loans grew 2% year-over-year, driven by 4% growth internationally. corporate loans grew 4% year-over-year. traditional corporate lending balances grew 4%, with growth in north america driven by higher client transaction activity. treasury and trade solutions loans decreased 8%, as citi maintained trade origination volumes while reducing lower spread assets and increasing asset sales to optimize returns. private bank and markets loans increased 16%, led by growth in the north america private bank, contributing to the revenue growth in that business. citi holdings loans decreased 21% year-over-year, mainly due to continued runoff and asset sales in the north america mortgage portfolio as well as the sales of the greece and spain consumer operations in the third quarter of 2014.
sequentially, loans were relatively unchanged, excluding the impact of fx translation, as the decline in citi holdings loans was offset by continued growth in citicorp, driven by consumer loans.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, average loans of $651 billion yielded an average rate of 6.7%, compared to $659 billion and 6.7% in the third quarter of 2014 and $659 billion and 7.0% in the fourth quarter of 2013.
for further information on citi's loan portfolios, see "managing global risk-credit risk" and "- country risk" below.
other assets the fluctuations in other assets during the periods presented were largely changes in brokerage receivables driven by normal business activities.
liabilities deposits for a discussion of citi's deposits, see "managing global risk-market risk-funding and liquidity risk" below.
federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase (repos)
citi's federal funds purchased were not significant for the periods presented. the decrease in repos and securities lending transactions was due to the impact of fx translation and the continued optimization of secured funding.
for further information on citi's secured financing transactions, see "managing global risk-market risk-funding and liquidity" below.
trading account liabilities the increase in trading account liabilities from the prior-year period was consistent with and driven by the increase in trading account assets, as discussed above. average trading account liabilities were $147 billion during the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $112 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.
debt for information on citi's long-term and short-term debt borrowings, see "managing global risk-market risk-funding and liquidity risk" below.
other liabilities the increase in other liabilities from the prior-year period was driven by the reclassification to held-for-sale of approximately $21 billion of deposits as a result of citi's entry into an agreement in december 2014 to sell its japan retail banking business, as well as changes in the levels of brokerage payables driven by normal business activities.

(1)   the supplemental information presented in the table above reflects citigroup's consolidated gaap balance sheet by reporting segment as of december 31, 2014. the respective segment information depicts the assets and liabilities managed by each segment as of such date. while this presentation is not defined by gaap, citi believes that these non-gaap financial measures enhance investors' understanding of the balance sheet components managed by the underlying business segments, as well as the beneficial inter-relationships of the asset and liability dynamics of the balance sheet components among citi's business segments.
(2)   consolidating eliminations for total citigroup and citigroup parent company assets and liabilities are recorded within the corporate/other segment.
(3)   the total stockholders' equity and the majority of long-term debt of citigroup reside in the citigroup parent company consolidated balance sheet. citigroup allocates stockholders' equity and long-term debt to its businesses through inter-segment allocations as shown above.
(4)   reflects reclassification of approximately $21 billion of deposits to held-for-sale (other liabilities) at december 31, 2014 as a result of the agreement to sell citi's retail banking business in japan.

off balance sheet arrangements citigroup enters into various types of off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. citi's involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:
•   purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in unconsolidated special purpose entities, such as credit card receivables and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization entities;
•   holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated special purpose entities;
•   providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties; and
•   entering into operating leases for property and equipment.
citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. for example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. securitization arrangements also assist citi and citi's customers in monetizing their financial assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.
the table below shows where a discussion of citi's various off balance sheet arrangements may be found in this form 10-k. in addition, see notes 1, 22 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements.

(2)   contractual obligations related to interest payments on long-term debt for 2015-2019 are calculated by applying the december 31, 2014 weighted- average interest rate (3.34%) on average outstanding long-term debt to the average remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years. the "thereafter" interest payments on long-term debt for the remaining years to maturity (for 2020-2098) are calculated by applying interest rates on the remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years.
(3)   purchase obligations consist of obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on citi. for presentation purposes, purchase obligations are included in the table above through the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is renewable. many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses that would allow citi to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in the table above (unless citi has already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the agreement).
(4)   other liabilities reflected on citigroup's consolidated balance sheet includes accounts payable, accrued expenses, uncertain tax positions and other liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in cash; legal reserve accruals are not included in the table above. also includes discretionary contributions in 2015 for citi's non-u.s. pension plans and the non-u.s. postretirement plans, as well as employee benefit obligations accounted for under sfas 87 (asc 715), sfas 106 (asc 715) and sfas 112 (asc 712).

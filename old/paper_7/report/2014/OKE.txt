item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item 1, business, our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
recent developments the following discussion highlights some of our planned activities, recent achievements and significant issues affecting us. due to the separation of our former natural gas distribution business on january 31, 2014, the wind down of our former energy services business on march 31, 2014, and the subsequent reporting of such businesses as discontinued operations, income from
43
continuing operations reflects the continuing operations of oneok partners and of oneok as its general partner. all references to income as used in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to income from continuing operations. please refer to the "financial results and operating information," and "liquidity and capital resources" sections of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information.
separation of natural gas distribution business - in january 2014, our board of directors unanimously approved the separation of our natural gas distribution business into a stand-alone publicly traded company called one gas, which was completed on january 31, 2014. oneok shareholders of record at the close of business on january 21, 2014, retained their current shares of oneok stock and received one share of one gas stock for every four shares of oneok stock owned in a transaction that was tax-free to oneok and its shareholders. our natural gas distribution business, which generated operating income of $47.5 million in january 2014, was classified as discontinued operations on january 31, 2014. we also incurred $23.0 million of after-tax costs associated with the separation for the year ended december 31, 2014, that have been recorded in income (loss) from discontinued operations. see additional discussion in note b to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
in connection with the separation, we received a cash payment of approximately $1.13 billion from one gas and used the proceeds to repay all of our outstanding commercial paper and to retire approximately $552.5 million of long-term debt. as a result of the early retirement of long-term debt, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of approximately $24.8 million, which is included in other expense, and reclassified losses to interest expense of approximately $7.7 million due to the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting for the related interest-rate swaps. we also amended and restated our oneok credit agreement effective january 31, 2014, to reduce the size of the facility to $300 million from $1.2 billion and recorded a charge to interest expense of approximately $2.9 million related to amortization of previous credit agreement issuance costs.
wind down of energy services business - we completed the wind down of our energy services business, which ceased operations on march 31, 2014, and was classified as discontinued operations. see additional discussion in note b to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
change in reportable segments - following the separation of our natural gas distribution business into one gas and the wind down of our energy services business, our chief operating decision maker reviews the financial performance of each of the three segments of oneok partners on a regular basis to assess the performance of, and allocate resources to, oneok partners. as a result, our reportable segments have changed to reflect the three business segments of oneok partners. we have reflected the change in reporting segments for all periods presented. see also note s to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information.
ownership of oneok partners - oneok and its subsidiaries own all of the general partner interest and certain limited partner interests, which, together, represented a 37.8 percent ownership interest at december 31, 2014, in oneok partners, one of the largest publicly traded master limited partnerships.
commodity prices - due in part to the rapid growth in crude oil production in the united states, the global supply of crude oil has exceeded demand and led to a dramatic fall in crude oil prices. commodity prices declined sharply in the fourth quarter 2014 and continued to decline into early 2015. wti crude oil prices declined to less than $50.00 per barrel in early 2015, compared with approximately $90.00 per barrel in september 2014. nymex natural gas prices also declined to approximately $3.00 per mmbtu in early 2015, compared with prices in excess of $4.00 per mmbtu in september 2014. the decline in crude oil prices has also contributed to lower ngl product prices, as well as narrow ngl product price differentials.
we expect lower commodity prices and narrow location and product price differentials to persist throughout 2015. producer capital investment is expected to decrease, which combined with natural production declines and reduced drilling activity, is expected to slow natural gas and ngl supply growth. the lower commodity prices and slower supply growth are expected to adversely impact oneok partners' and our results of operations and cash flows in 2015, particularly in the natural gas gathering and processing segment where revenues are derived primarily from commodity-based contracts with fee components.
we continue to expect that natural gas liquids volumes will be affected negatively in the natural gas liquids segment as a result of ethane rejection. we expect ethane rejection will persist until new world-scale ethylene production capacity begins coming on line, which is anticipated to be in 2017. market conditions may result in periods where it is economical to recover the ethane component in the natural gas liquids stream. ethane rejection is expected to have a significant impact on our financial results through 2017. however, the natural gas liquids segment's integrated assets enable it to mitigate partially the
44
impact of ethane rejection through minimum volume commitments and its ability to utilize the transportation capacity made available due to ethane rejection to capture additional ngl location price differentials in its optimization activities.
oneok partners' growth projects - through 2014, crude oil and natural gas producers continued to drill aggressively for crude oil and ngl-rich natural gas in many regions where oneok partners has operations, including the bakken shale and three forks formations in the williston basin; the niobrara shale and other formations in the powder river basin; and in the cana-woodford shale, woodford shale, mississippian lime, springer shale, stack and scoop areas in the mid-continent region. in response to this increased production of crude oil, natural gas and ngls, and higher demand for ngl products from the petrochemical industry, oneok partners has completed growth projects and acquisitions totaling approximately $5.9 billion from 2010 through 2014 and has approximately $2.1 billion to $3.0 billion of projects in various stages of construction, including approximately $2.2 billion in new projects and acquisitions announced in 2014, to meet the needs of natural gas producers and processors in these regions, as well as enhance its natural gas liquids fractionation, distribution and storage infrastructure in the gulf coast region. the execution of these capital investments aligns with oneok partners' strategy to generate consistent growth and sustainable earnings. acreage dedications and contractual commitments from producers and natural gas processors in regions associated with oneok partners' growth projects are expected to provide incremental cash flows and long-term fee-based earnings.
while reduced producer drilling activity is expected to slow supply growth, oneok partners expects to complete its previously announced projects to meet producers' demand for its gathering, processing fractionation and transportation services. however, oneok partners has suspended capital expenditures for certain natural gas processing plants and related infrastructure to align with the needs of its customers. oneok partners expects to resume its suspended capital-growth projects as soon as market conditions improve. if the current commodity price environment persists for a prolonged period, it may impact the timing or demand for additional infrastructure projects or growth opportunities in the future.
see discussion of oneok partners' growth projects in the "financial results and operating information" section in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments.
west texas lpg - in november 2014, oneok partners acquired the west texas lpg system for approximately $800 million. see additional discussion in the "financial results and operating information" section in the natural gas liquids segment.
bighorn gas gathering impairment charge - as a result of the continued decline in dry natural gas volumes gathered in the coal-bed methane area of the powder river basin and the operator recording an impairment of the underlying assets of bighorn gas gathering in september 2014, oneok partners reviewed its equity method investment in bighorn gas gathering as of september 30, 2014, and recorded noncash impairment charges totaling $76.4 million. see additional discussion in the "financial results and operating information" section in the natural gas gathering and processing segment.
dividends/distributions - during 2014, we paid dividends totaling $2.125 per share, an increase of approximately 44 percent over the $1.48 per share paid during 2013.  we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.605 per share ($2.42 per share on an annualized basis) in january 2015, an increase of approximately 51 percent over the $0.40 declared in january 2014.  during 2014, oneok partners paid cash distributions totaling $3.01 per unit, an increase of approximately 5 percent from the $2.87 per unit paid during 2013.  oneok partners paid total cash distributions to us in 2014 of $605.3 million, which includes $279.3 million resulting from our limited-partner interest and $326.0 million related to our general partner interest.  a cash distribution from oneok partners of $0.79 per unit ($3.16 per unit on an annualized basis) was declared in january 2015, an increase of approximately 8 percent from the $0.73 declared in january 2014.
oneok partners equity issuances - in may 2014, oneok partners completed an underwritten public offering of approximately 13.9 million common units at a public offering price of $52.94 per common unit, generating net proceeds of approximately $714.5 million. in conjunction with this issuance, we contributed approximately $15.0 million in order to maintain our 2 percent general partner interest in oneok partners. oneok partners used the proceeds to repay commercial paper, fund its capital expenditures and for general partnership purposes.
during 2014, oneok partners sold approximately 7.9 million common units through its "at-the-market" equity program. net cash proceeds, including our contribution to maintain our 2 percent general partner interest in oneok partners, were approximately $402.1 million, which were used for general partnership purposes.
as a result of these transactions, our aggregate ownership interest in oneok partners decreased to 37.8 percent at december 31, 2014, compared with 41.2 percent at december 31, 2013.

(a) - includes capital expenditures of discontinued operations of $23.9 million, $292.1 million and $280.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
2014 vs. 2013 - revenues and net margin for 2014, compared with 2013, increased due primarily to higher volumes across oneok partners' systems. oneok partners' new natural gas processing plants in the williston basin and mid-continent region resulted in increased natural gas volumes gathered, processed and sold in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, and combined with third-party plant connections, increased ngl volumes transported in the natural gas liquids segment's exchange-services business. oneok partners experienced increased optimization, marketing and isomerization margins from wider realized ngl product price differentials in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily related to increased weather-related seasonal demand for propane during the first quarter 2014 and wider realized ngl product price differential between normal butane and iso-butane. the natural gas pipelines segment also experienced higher transportation revenues, primarily from increased rates and higher contracted capacity and higher storage revenues from park-and-loan activity. these margin increases were offset partially by the impact of ethane rejection in the natural gas liquids segment and lower contracted storage capacity in the natural gas pipelines segment.
operating costs and depreciation and amortization expense increased for 2014, compared with 2013, due primarily to the growth of oneok partners' operations related to the completed capital projects in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments.
equity earnings decreased for 2014, compared with 2013, due primarily to noncash impairment charges totaling $76.4 million related to oneok partners' equity method investment in bighorn gas gathering in the natural gas gathering and processing segment.
46
interest expense increased for 2014, compared with 2013, primarily as a result of higher interest costs incurred associated with a full year of interest costs on oneok partners' issuance of $1.25 billion of senior notes in september 2013.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, which reflects primarily the portion of oneok partners that we do not own, increased for 2014, compared with 2013, due primarily to the changes in earnings at oneok partners.
capital expenditures decreased for 2014, compared with 2013, due primarily to decreased capital expenditures due to the separation of one gas and lower oneok partners capital expenditures due to the timing of expenditures related to growth projects in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments. in 2014, oneok partners also completed the west texas lpg acquisition for approximately $800 million compared with the 2013 sage creek and maysville acquisitions totaling approximately $395 million.
additional information regarding the financial results and operating information is provided in the following discussion for each of the segments.
2013 vs. 2012 - revenues and net margin for 2013, compared with 2012, increased due primarily to higher natural gas and ngl volumes gathered, processed and sold from completed capital projects in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments, offset partially by lower net realized natural gas and ngl product prices, and ethane rejection. the increase in natural gas supply resulting from the development of nonconventional resource areas in north america contributed to lower ngl product prices, narrower ngl location price differentials and narrower natural gas location and seasonal price differentials in the markets oneok partners serves, compared with 2012. however, in december 2013, the price of propane increased significantly, and the differential between the conway, kansas, and mont belvieu, texas, markets for propane also widened in favor of conway, kansas, due to colder than normal weather and lower propane inventory levels. the price of propane in the mid-continent market and the wider location price differentials between the mid-continent and gulf coast centers peaked in late january 2014 and moderated by the end of february 2014 as supply and demand rebalanced.
ngl location price differentials were significantly narrower between the mid-continent market center at conway, kansas, and the gulf coast market center at mont belvieu, texas, for 2013, compared with 2012, due primarily to strong ngl production growth from the development of ngl-rich areas, exceeding the petrochemical industry's capacity to consume the increased supply resulting in higher ethane inventory levels at mont belvieu. additionally, an unusually long maintenance outage season in the petrochemical industry during 2013 reduced ethane demand, which also contributed to the higher ethane inventory levels.
the differential between the composite price of ngl products and the price of natural gas, particularly the differential between ethane and natural gas, influenced the volume of ngls recovered from natural gas processing plants. the low ethane prices resulted in ethane rejection at most of oneok partners' natural gas processing plants and its customers' natural gas processing plants connected to its natural gas liquids system in the mid-continent and rocky mountain regions during 2013.
operating costs and depreciation and amortization expense increased for 2013, compared with 2012, due primarily to the growth of oneok partners' operations related to the completed capital projects in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments.
interest expense increased in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily as a result of higher interest costs incurred associated with a full year of interest costs on oneok partners' issuance of $1.3 billion of senior notes in september 2012 and interest costs on oneok partners' issuance of $1.25 billion of senior notes in september 2013. this was offset partially by higher capitalized interest associated with the investments in oneok partners' growth projects in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects primarily the earnings of oneok partners attributable to the portion of oneok partners that we do not own.
income from discontinued operations for 2013, compared with 2012, decreased due primarily to $138.6 million in noncash charges related to the wind down of our former energy services business from the release of a significant portion of its natural gas transportation and storage contracts to third parties. net income from discontinued operations for 2013 also reflects approximately $9.4 million in costs incurred related to the separation of the natural gas distribution business.
capital expenditures increased for 2013, compared with 2012, due primarily to the growth projects in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments. in 2013, oneok partners also acquired a business in the niobrara shale formation of the power river basin and purchased the remaining 30 percent interest in the maysville, oklahoma, natural gas processing facility.

additional information regarding our results of operations is provided in the following discussion of operating results for each of our segments.
natural gas gathering and processing growth projects - beginning in 2010, the natural gas gathering and processing segment has invested approximately $4.0 billion to $4.7 billion in growth projects in ngl-rich areas in the williston basin, the powder river basin, the cana-woodford shale, the springer shale, the stack and the scoop areas that oneok partners expects will enable it to meet the rapidly growing needs of crude oil and natural gas producers in those areas. nearly all of the new natural gas production is from horizontally drilled and completed wells in nonconventional resource areas. these wells tend to produce volumes at higher initial production rates resulting generally in higher initial decline rates than conventional vertical wells; however, the decline rates flatten out over time. these wells are expected to have long productive lives.
oneok partners has completed approximately $2.2 billion of the growth projects and acquisitions in this segment from 2010 through 2014, which include the following:

as a result of announced reductions in crude oil and natural gas drilling activities by producers and the expectation of slower supply growth due to the recent decline in crude oil, natural gas and ngl prices, oneok partners has suspended capital expenditures for certain natural gas processing plants and field infrastructure. oneok partners expects to resume its suspended capital-growth projects as soon as market conditions improve. if the current commodity price environment persists
48
for a prolonged period, it may further impact the timing or demand for these projects and additional infrastructure projects or growth opportunities in the future.
rocky mountain region:
williston basin processing plants and related projects - oneok partners is constructing natural gas gathering and processing assets in the williston basin to meet the growing needs of crude oil and natural gas producers. when its announced projects are completed, it will have natural gas processing capacity of approximately 1.2 bcf/d in the basin. oneok partners has acreage dedications of approximately 3 million net acres supporting these projects.
garden creek ii plant - the garden creek ii natural gas processing plant was completed in august 2014.
garden creek iii plant - the garden creek iii natural gas processing plant, originally scheduled for completion in the first quarter 2015, was completed in october 2014.
natural gas compression - in july 2014, oneok partners announced it will construct additional natural gas compression across its williston basin system to take advantage of additional natural gas processing capacity at its garden creek and stateline facilities by a total of 100 mmcf/d.
lonesome creek plant - in november 2013, oneok partners announced it will construct the lonesome creek natural gas processing plant and related infrastructure, which will be located in mckenzie county, north dakota. the plant and infrastructure will help address natural gas gathering and processing constraints in the region.
stateline de-ethanizers - oneok partners plans to construct de-ethanizer towers at its stateline natural gas processing plants, located in williams county, north dakota. once completed, the de-ethanizer towers will remove ethane from the natural gas stream, which we expect to then be sold under a long-term, fee-based contract to a customer who plans to transport the ethane on a third-party pipeline.
bear creek plant - in september 2014, oneok partners announced it will construct the bear creek natural gas processing plant and related infrastructure, which will be located in dunn county, north dakota. the plant and infrastructure will help alleviate pipeline inefficiencies in an area challenged by geographical constraints and severe terrain.

commodity prices declined sharply in the fourth quarter 2014 and continued to decline into early 2015. wti crude oil prices declined to less than $50.00 per barrel in early 2015, compared with approximately $90.00 per barrel in september 2014. nymex natural gas prices also declined to approximately $3.00 per mmbtu in early 2015, compared with prices in excess of $4.00 per mmbtu in september 2014. oneok partners expects lower commodity prices to persist throughout 2015. in response, crude oil and natural gas exploration and production capital investment is expected to decrease, which combined with production declines and reduced drilling activity is expected to slow crude oil, natural gas and ngl supply growth. oneok partners expects crude oil and natural gas producers to focus capital spending and drilling activities on core locations that are most economical to develop. the lower commodity price environment is expected to have an adverse impact on the natural gas gathering and processing segment's financial results in 2015.
50
2014 vs. 2013 - net margin increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   an increase of $147.6 million due primarily to natural gas volume growth in the williston basin and cana-woodford shale and increased ownership of the maysville, oklahoma, natural gas processing plant resulting in higher natural gas volumes gathered, compressed, processed, transported and sold, higher ngl volumes sold and higher fees, offset partially by wellhead freeze-offs due to severely cold weather in the first quarter 2014;
•   an increase of $11.3 million due primarily to higher net realized natural gas and ngl prices; and
•   an increase of $8.8 million due primarily to changes in contract mix; offset partially by
•   a decrease of $6.4 million due to a condensate contract settlement in 2013.
operating costs increased due primarily to the growth of oneok partners' operations and reflect the following:
•   an increase of $46.3 million in higher materials and supplies, and outside service expenses; and
•   an increase of $21.2 million in employee-related costs due to higher labor and employee benefit costs; offset partially by
•   a decrease of $3.2 million due to lower ad valorem tax expense resulting from capitalized taxes related to construction projects.
depreciation and amortization expense increased due to the completion of growth projects and acquisitions.
equity earnings (loss) from investments decreased due to $76.4 million in impairment charges in the third quarter 2014 on oneok partners' investment in bighorn gas gathering. see additional discussion in "equity investments" below.
capital expenditures increased due primarily to the timing of oneok partners' growth projects discussed above.
see "capital expenditures" in "liquidity and capital resources" for additional detail of oneok partners' projected capital expenditures.
2013 vs. 2012 - net margin increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   an increase of $100.1 million due primarily to volume growth in the williston basin from the stateline i and stateline ii natural gas processing plants, and increased well connections resulting in higher natural gas volumes gathered, compressed, processed, transported and sold, higher ngl volumes sold and higher fees; and
•   an increase of $6.4 million due to a contract settlement in 2013; offset partially by
•   a decrease of $41.7 million due primarily to lower net realized ngl prices;
•   a decrease of $13.4 million due primarily to changes in contract mix and terms associated with volume growth; and
•   a decrease of $3.5 million due to lower dry natural gas volumes gathered as a result of continued declines in coal-bed methane production in the powder river basin.
operating costs increased due primarily to the growth of oneok partners' operations and reflect the following:
•   an increase of $16.8 million in higher materials and supplies, and outside service expenses;
•   an increase of $10.3 million in employee-related costs due to higher labor and employee benefit costs, offset partially by lower incentive compensation costs; and
•   an increase of $2.2 million due to higher ad valorem taxes.
depreciation and amortization expense increased due to the completion of the stateline i and stateline ii natural gas processing plants in the williston basin, the completion of well connections and infrastructure projects supporting oneok partners' volume growth in the williston basin and the acquisition of the sage creek plant in wyoming.
equity earnings from investments decreased due primarily to lower ngl prices and declines in dry natural gas volumes gathered by certain of oneok partners' equity investments in the powder river basin.
capital expenditures increased due to oneok partners' growth projects discussed above. in 2013, oneok partners also completed the sage creek acquisition in the ngl-rich niobrara shale area of the powder river basin and acquired the remaining 30 percent interest in the maysville, oklahoma, natural gas processing facility.

natural gas gathered and processed, ngl sales and residue natural gas sales increased due to the completion of growth projects and/or acquisitions in the williston basin,power river basin and mid-continent areas, offset partially by declines in volumes in the coal-bed methane area of the powder river basin. the quantity and composition of ngls and natural gas continue to change as oneok partners' new natural gas processing plants in the williston basin and mid-continent are placed in service. in march 2014, oneok partners' canadian valley plant in oklahoma was completed, which has better ethane rejection capabilities than its other processing plants in the mid-continent region. as a result, oneok partners realized composite ngl net sales price increased while most individual ngl product prices were lower. oneok partners' garden creek i, garden creek ii, garden creek iii, stateline i and stateline ii plants in the williston basin have the capability to recover ethane when economic conditions warrant but did not do so in 2014. oneok partners' equity ngl volumes are expected to be weighted more toward propane due to expected ethane rejection.

equity investments - producers have primarily focused their development efforts on crude oil and ngl-rich supply basins rather than in areas with dry natural gas production, such as the coal-bed methane production areas in the powder river basin.  the reduced coal-bed methane development activities and production declines in the dry natural gas formations of the powder river basin have resulted in lower natural gas volumes available to be gathered.  while the reserve potential in the dry natural gas formations of the powder river basin still exists, future drilling and development in this area will be affected by commodity prices and producers' alternative prospects.
during 2014, the coal-bed methane volumes gathered on the bighorn gas gathering system, in which oneok partners owns a 49 percent equity interest and which operates in the coal-bed methane area of the powder river basin, declined at a rate greater than in prior periods and greater than expected. due to these additional declines in volumes, bighorn gas gathering recorded an impairment of its underlying assets in september 2014, when the operator determined that the volume decline would be sustained for the foreseeable future. as a result of these developments, oneok partners' reviewed its equity method investment in bighorn gas gathering for impairment and recorded noncash impairment charges of $76.4 million related to bighorn gas gathering. the noncash impairment charges are included in equity earnings from investments in our accompanying consolidated statements of income. the net book value of oneok partners' equity method investment in bighorn gas gathering is $7.9 million at december 31, 2014, and no equity method goodwill remains. we determined there were no impairments to investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2013 or 2012.

a continued decline in volumes gathered in the coal-bed methane area of the powder river basin may reduce oneok partners' ability to recover the carrying value of its equity investments in this area and could result in additional noncash charges to earnings. the net book value of oneok partners' remaining equity method investments in this dry natural gas area is $206.0 million, which includes $130.5 million of equity method goodwill. we expect the energy commodity price environment to remain depressed for at least the near term, which has caused producers to announce plans for reduced drilling for crude oil and natural gas, which we expect will slow volume growth or reduce volumes of natural gas delivered to systems owned by its equity method investments.
natural gas liquids growth projects - oneok partners' growth strategy in the natural gas liquids segment is focused around the crude oil and ngl-rich natural gas drilling activity in shale and other nonconventional resource areas from the rocky mountain region through the mid-continent region into texas and new mexico.  increasing crude oil, natural gas and ngl production resulting from this activity and higher petrochemical industry demand for ngl products have resulted in oneok partners making additional capital investments to expand its infrastructure to bring these commodities from supply basins to market.  expansion of the petrochemical industry in the united states is expected to increase ethane demand significantly in the next two to four years, and international demand for ngls, particularly propane, also is increasing and is expected to continue to do so in the future.
beginning in 2010, the natural gas liquids segment has invested approximately $4.0 billion in ngl-related projects. these investments will accommodate the transportation and fractionation of growing ngl supply from shale and other resource development areas across oneok partners' asset base and alleviate infrastructure constraints between the mid-continent and gulf coast market centers to meet increasing petrochemical industry and ngl export demand in the gulf coast. over time, these growing fee-based ngl volumes are expected to fill much of oneok partners' natural gas liquids pipeline capacity used historically to capture the ngl location price differentials between the two market centers.
oneok partners has completed approximately $3.8 billion in growth projects and acquisitions in this segment from 2010 through 2014, which include the following:

as a result of announced reductions in crude oil and natural gas drilling activities and the expectation of slower supply growth due to the recent declines in crude oil, natural gas and ngl prices, oneok partners has suspended capital expenditures for certain natural gas liquids infrastructure projects related to planned natural gas processing plants. oneok partners expects to resume its suspended capital-growth projects as soon as market conditions improve. if the current commodity price environment persists for a prolonged period, it may further impact the timing or demand for these projects and additional infrastructure projects or growth opportunities in the future.
ethane/propane splitter - in march 2014, oneok partners placed in service an ethane/propane splitter at its mont belvieu storage facility to split ethane/propane mix into purity ethane to meet the needs of petrochemical customers, which is expected to grow over the long-term. the facility is capable of producing 32 mbbl/d of purity ethane and 8 mbbl/d of propane.
sterling iii pipeline - in march 2014, oneok partners completed a 550-mile natural gas liquids pipeline, which has the flexibility to transport either unfractionated ngls or ngl products from the mid-continent to the gulf coast.  the pipeline is designed to transport up to 193 mbbl/d of ngl production from medford, oklahoma, to oneok partners' storage and fractionation facilities in mont belvieu, texas. oneok partners' has multiyear supply commitments from producers and natural gas processors for approximately 75 percent of the pipeline's capacity. installation of additional pump stations could expand the capacity of the pipeline to 260 mbbl/d. this project also included the reconfiguration of oneok partners' existing sterling i and sterling ii pipelines to transport either unfractionated ngls or ngl products. the reconfiguration was completed in july 2014.
bakken ngl pipeline expansion, phase i - the first expansion, completed in september 2014, increased the pipeline's capacity to 135 mbbl/d from the original capacity of 60 mbbl/d, with the second expansion expected to bring the pipeline's capacity to 160 mbbl/d. these expansions will accommodate the growing ngl supply from the williston and powder river basins.
niobrara ngl lateral - oneok partners constructed new natural gas liquids pipeline infrastructure to connect the sage creek natural gas processing plant and a third-party natural gas processing plant to its bakken ngl pipeline, which was completed in september 2014.
west texas lpg acquisition - in november 2014, oneok partners completed its acquisition of an 80 percent interest in the west texas lpg pipeline limited partnership and a 100 percent interest in the mesquite pipeline for approximately $800 million from affiliates of chevron corporation, and oneok partners became the operator of both pipelines. the acquisition consists of approximately 2,600 miles of natural gas liquids gathering pipelines extending from the permian basin in southeastern new mexico to east texas and mont belvieu, texas. the pipeline system increased oneok partners' natural gas liquids gathering system by approximately 60 percent to nearly 7,100 miles of natural gas liquids gathering pipelines and added approximately 285,000 barrels per day of ngl capacity.  these assets are expected to provide oneok partners additional fee-based earnings and its natural gas liquids infrastructure with access to a new natural gas liquids supply basin.
mb-3 fractionator - in december 2014, oneok partners completed the mb-3 fractionator. the mb-3 fractionator is located near its storage facility in mont belvieu, texas. in addition, it expanded and upgraded its existing natural gas liquids gathering and pipeline infrastructure, which includes new connections to natural gas processing facilities and increasing the capacity of its arbuckle and sterling ii natural gas liquids pipelines. oneok partners has multiyear supply commitments from producers and natural gas processors for approximately 80 percent of the fractionator's capacity.
natural gas liquids pipeline and modification of hutchinson fractionation infrastructure - oneok partners is constructing a new 95-mile natural gas liquids pipeline that will connect its existing natural gas liquids fractionation and storage facilities in
54
hutchinson, kansas, to similar facilities in medford, oklahoma. the project also included modifications that were completed in december 2014 to existing natural gas liquids fractionation infrastructure at hutchinson, kansas, increasing fractionation capacity by 20 mbbl/d, to accommodate additional unfractionated ngls produced in the williston basin.
bakken ngl pipeline expansion, phase ii - the second expansion will increase the pipeline's capacity to 160 mbbl/d from the current capacity of 135 mbbl/d.
bear creek natural gas liquids infrastructure - oneok partners announced in september 2014 its plan to build new natural gas liquids pipeline infrastructure to connect the bear creek natural gas processing plant to its bakken ngl pipeline.
bronco natural gas liquids infrastructure - oneok partners announced in september 2014 its plan to build new natural gas liquids pipeline infrastructure to connect the bronco natural gas processing plant to its bakken ngl pipeline.
demicks lake natural gas liquids infrastructure - oneok partners announced in july 2014 its plan to build new natural gas liquids pipeline infrastructure to connect the demicks lake natural gas processing plant to its bakken ngl pipeline.
for a discussion of oneok partners' capital expenditure financing, see "capital expenditures" in "liquidity and capital resources."
selected financial results - the natural gas liquids segment's 2014 operating results reflect the benefits from the following completed growth projects:
•   the west texas lpg acquisition, which was completed in november 2014;
•   the niobrara ngl lateral, which was completed in september 2014;
•   the bakken ngl pipeline expansion, phase i, which was completed in september 2014;
•   the sterling iii pipeline and reconfigurations to sterling i and ii, which were completed in march 2014;
•   the ethane/propane splitter, which was completed in march 2014;
•   the mb-2 fractionator, which was completed in december 2013;
•   the sage creek ngl infrastructure, which was completed in september 2013;
•   the bakken ngl pipeline, which was completed in april 2013;
•   the expansion of the overland pass pipeline, which was completed in the second quarter 2013; and
•   the ethane header pipeline, which was completed in april 2013.
these projects have resulted in additional natural gas liquids volumes gathered, fractionated and transported across oneok partners' natural gas liquids systems; however, the volumes fractionated and transported decreased in 2014 due to ethane rejection. oneok partners expects these investments along with its other announced growth projects will accommodate the growing ngl supply from shale and other resource development areas across its asset base and will continue to alleviate infrastructure constraints between the mid-continent and texas gulf coast regions to meet the increasing petrochemical industry and ngl export demand.

several factors contributed to increased propane demand and price in the first quarter 2014, which impacted oneok partners' results of operations in 2014. in the fourth quarter 2013, oneok partners experienced high propane demand for crop drying and increased heating demand due to colder than normal weather that continued into the first quarter 2014. in response to increased demand, propane prices at the mid-continent market center at conway, kansas, increased significantly, compared with propane prices at the gulf coast market center at mont belvieu, texas. to help meet the demand and capture the wider location price differentials between these two markets, oneok partners utilized its assets to deliver more propane into the mid-continent region from the gulf coast region. the price of propane in the mid-continent market and the wider location price differentials between the mid-continent and gulf coast market centers peaked in late january 2014 and returned to historical levels by the end of february 2014 as supply and demand balanced.
the recent volatility in crude oil prices has also impacted ngl prices, as ngl prices are generally linked to crude oil prices. these price decreases affected oneok partners' ngl sales revenues and cost of sales.
ethane rejection in the rocky mountain and mid-continent regions continued in 2014 as expected, resulting in available capacity on oneok partners' pipelines that connect the mid-continent and gulf coast market centers, a portion of which it was able to utilize for optimization activities, including the delivery of propane into the mid-continent region during the first quarter 2014. severely cold weather in the first quarter 2014 caused wellhead freeze-offs, which also reduced volumes.
2014 vs. 2013 - net margin increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   an increase of $157.4 million in exchange-services and transportation margins, which resulted from increased volumes from new plants connected in the williston basin and mid-continent region, and higher fees for exchange-services activities resulting from contract renegotiations, offset partially by lower volumes from the termination of a contract;
•   an increase of $79.8 million in optimization and marketing margins, which resulted from a $31.4 million increase due primarily to wider realized ngl product price differentials; a $25.2 million increase in marketing margins related primarily to increased weather-related seasonal demand for propane during the first quarter 2014, and marketing and truck and rail activities in the second, third and fourth quarters 2014; and a $23.2 million increase due primarily to significantly wider ngl location price differentials, primarily related to increased weather-related seasonal demand for propane during the first quarter 2014, offset partially by lower optimization volumes in the second, third and fourth quarters 2014 when differentials narrowed; and
•   an increase of $22.8 million related to higher isomerization volumes, resulting from the wider ngl product price differential between normal butane and iso-butane; offset partially by
•   a decrease of $18.3 million resulting from the impact of ethane rejection, which resulted in lower ngl volumes; and
56
•   a decrease of $6.0 million due to the impact of lower operational measurement gains.
operating costs increased primarily as a result of the completion of its growth projects, which include the following:
•   an increase of $20.1 million due to higher outside services expenses associated primarily with scheduled maintenance and the growth of operations related to completed capital projects;
•   an increase of $15.5 million due to higher ad valorem taxes related to its completed capital projects;
•   an increase of $14.9 million due to higher employee-related costs due primarily to higher labor and employee benefit costs; and
•   an increase of $3.4 million due to higher chemical, materials and supplies expense.
depreciation and amortization expense increased due primarily to the depreciation associated with oneok partners' completed capital projects.
equity earnings increased in 2014, compared with 2013, due primarily to higher volumes delivered to overland pass pipeline from oneok partners' bakken ngl pipeline that was placed in service in april 2013 and revenues from minimum volume agreements, offset partially by increased ethane rejection and higher operating costs.
capital expenditures decreased due primarily to timing of expenditures on oneok partners' growth projects discussed above. allowance for equity funds used during construction decreased due to the completion of all of oneok partners' regulated projects.
2013 vs. 2012 - net margin decreased primarily as a result of the following:
•   a decrease of $162.7 million in optimization and marketing margins, which resulted from a $202.5 million decrease due primarily to significantly narrower ngl location price differentials. this decrease was offset partially by an increase of $35.7 million due primarily to more favorable ngl product price differentials;
•   a decrease of $48.8 million resulting from the impact of ethane rejection, which resulted in lower ngl volumes; and
•   a decrease of $22.4 million related to lower isomerization volumes, resulting from the narrower price differential between normal butane and iso-butane; offset partially by
•   an increase of $166.5 million in exchange-services margins, which resulted from higher ngl volumes gathered, contract renegotiations for higher fees for oneok partners' ngl exchange-services activities and higher revenues from customers with minimum volume obligations;
•   an increase of $19.5 million due to the impact of operational measurement gains of approximately $9.7 million in 2013, compared with losses of approximately $9.8 million in 2012; and
•   an increase of $10.5 million in storage margins due primarily to contract renegotiations.
operating costs increased primarily as a result of the growth of the segment's operations and reflect the following:
•   an increase of $5.4 million due to higher ad valorem taxes related to oneok partners' completed capital projects; and
•   an increase of $5.0 million in employee-related costs due to higher labor and employee benefit costs due to the growth of oneok partners' operations related to its completed capital projects, offset partially by lower incentive compensation costs.
depreciation and amortization expense increased due primarily to the depreciation associated with the segment's completed capital projects.
equity earnings increased compared with 2012 due primarily to higher volumes delivered to overland pass pipeline from oneok partners' bakken ngl pipeline that was placed in service in april 2013, offset partially by reduced volumes as a result of ethane rejection. the impact of ethane rejection reduced equity earnings by $13.3 million compared with 2012.
capital expenditures and the allowance for equity funds used during construction increased due primarily to the segment's growth projects discussed above. in 2013, oneok partners also completed the sage creek acquisition in the ngl-rich niobrara shale area of the powder river basin that included natural gas liquids gathering pipelines.

(a) - includes volumes for consolidated entities only.
(b) - includes volumes at company-owned and third-party facilities.
2014 vs. 2013 - ngls transported on gathering lines and ngls fractionated decreased due primarily to the termination of a low margin contract and increased ethane rejection in the mid-continent and rocky mountain regions, offset partially by volumes from new plants connected in the williston basin and mid-continent region and from the west texas lpg system acquired in november 2014.
ngls transported on distribution lines decreased due primarily to lower volumes transported for oneok partners' optimization business due to narrower location price differentials during the second, third and fourth quarters 2014 between the conway and mont belvieu market centers and increased ethane rejection, offset partially by an increase in exchange volumes delivered to mont belvieu due to the completed sterling iii pipeline, which was placed in service in march 2014; and higher ngl volumes, primarily propane, during the first quarter 2014, transported to the mid-continent region due to increased demand.
2013 vs. 2012 - ngls transported on gathering lines increased due primarily to increased volumes from the williston basin made available by oneok partners' completed bakken ngl pipeline and increased volumes in the mid-continent region and texas made available through its cana-woodford shale and granite wash projects, offset partially by decreases in ngl volumes gathered as a result of ethane rejection.
ngls fractionated decreased due primarily to decreased volumes as a result of ethane rejection during 2013, offset partially by higher volumes supplied from the williston basin made available by oneok partners' completed bakken ngl pipeline.

2014 vs. 2013 - net margin increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   an increase of $26.3 million due to higher transportation revenues primarily from increased rates on intrastate pipelines, higher contracted capacity and rates on midwestern gas transmission and increased interruptible transportation revenues from higher natural gas volumes transported;
•   an increase of $17.6 million from higher short-term natural gas storage services due to higher park-and-loan activity as a result of weather-related seasonal demand primarily in the first quarter 2014 and greater capacity available for such services;
•   an increase of $5.1 million due to increased park-and-loan services on our interstate pipelines as a result of weather-related seasonal demand in the first quarter 2014;
•   an increase of $5.0 million from higher net retained fuel due to higher natural gas prices and natural gas volumes retained; and
•   an increase of $3.1 million from additional storage services to meet utility customers' peak-day demand; offset partially by
•   a decrease of $14.3 million due to lower storage revenues from lower contracted firm capacity.
operating costs increased primarily as a result of increased employee-related costs due to higher labor and employee benefit costs, as well as higher expenditures for outside services associated with scheduled maintenance and higher materials and supplies expenses.
gain on sale of assets decreased in 2014 as a result of excess pad gas sales of $6.8 million compared with $10.5 million in the prior year.
equity earnings from oneok partners' investments increased $4.8 million due primarily to increased park-and-loan services on northern border pipeline as a result of increased weather-related seasonal demand in the first quarter 2014, offset partially by lower contracted capacity. substantially all of northern border pipeline's long-haul transportation capacity has been contracted through march 2016.
2013 vs. 2012 - operating income increased in 2013, compared with 2012, reflecting an increase in transportation margins of $9.6 million due primarily to higher rates on guardian pipeline and higher contracted capacity with natural gas producers on oneok partners' intrastate pipelines, offset partially by a decrease of $3.9 million from lower net retained fuel. operating costs included an increase of $2.4 million due to higher employee-benefit costs. gain on sale of assets increased in 2013 from 2012 due primarily to a $10.5 million gain on excess pad gas sales in 2013 as a result of storage optimization review that resulted in additional working natural gas capacity of 2.0 bcf; 2012 results reflected a gain on sale of a natural gas pipeline lateral of $5.7 million.
equity earnings from oneok partners' investments decreased in 2013, compared with 2012, due to reduced transportation rates resulting from a northern border pipeline rate settlement, effective january 1, 2013. the new long-term transportation rates are approximately 11 percent lower than previous rates, which reduced oneok partners' equity earnings and cash distributions compared with 2012.

the natural gas pipelines primarily serve end users such as natural gas distribution and electric-generation companies that require natural gas to operate their businesses regardless of location price differentials.  the development of shale and other resource areas has continued to increase available natural gas supply resulting in narrower location and seasonal price differentials.  as additional supply is developed, oneok partners expects producers to demand incremental services in the future to transport their production to market.  the abundance of shale gas supply and new regulations on emissions from coal-fired electric-generation plants may also increase the demand for the services from electric-generation companies as they convert to a natural gas fuel source.  conversely, contracted capacity by certain customers that are focused on capturing location or seasonal price differentials may decrease in the future due to narrowing price differentials. overall, oneok

partners expects its fee-based earnings to remain relatively stable with growth in certain market areas as the development of shale and other resource areas continues.
in august 2014, viking gas transmission filed a "stipulation and agreement in resolutions of all issues concerning adjustment in rates of viking gas transmission company" (settlement) with the ferc. the settlement was approved on october 1, 2014, and became final on october 31, 2014. rates under the settlement became effective january 1, 2015, and we do not expect the settlement to materially impact us.
contingencies gas index pricing litigation - as previously reported, oneok and its subsidiary, oesc, along with several other energy companies, are defending multiple lawsuits arising from alleged market manipulation or false reporting of natural gas prices to natural gas-index publications. on april 10, 2013, the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the summary judgments that had been granted in favor of oneok, oesc and other unaffiliated defendants in the following cases: reorganized fli, learjet, arandell, heartland and newpage. the ninth circuit also reversed the summary judgment that had been granted in favor of oesc on all state law claims asserted in the sinclair case. oneok, oesc and the other unaffiliated defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court on august 26, 2013, seeking review of the ninth circuit decision. the ninth circuit has ordered the cases stayed until the final disposition of the petition for writ of certiorari. on july 1, 2014, the united states supreme court granted the petition for writ of certiorari. oral arguments were heard by the united states supreme court on january 12, 2015, and we expect a decision by mid-2015.
because of the uncertainty surrounding the gas index pricing litigation, including an insufficient description of the purported classes and other related matters, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential exposures at this time. however, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters could result in future charges that may be material to our results of operations.
other legal proceedings - we are a party to various other litigation matters and claims that have arisen in the normal course of our operations. while the results of these various other litigation matters and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the reasonably possible losses from such matters, individually and in the aggregate, are not material. additionally, we believe the probable final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
liquidity and capital resources general - prior to the separation of our former natural gas distribution business, we relied primarily on operating cash flows, bank credit facilities, commercial paper, debt issuances and the issuance of equity for our liquidity and capital resource requirements. effective in february 2014 and in connection with the separation, we terminated our commercial paper program and now fund operating expenses, debt service and dividends to shareholders with operating cash flows, which are primarily comprised of cash distributions received from oneok partners.
neither oneok nor oneok partners guarantees the debt or other similar commitments to unaffiliated parties, and oneok does not guarantee the debt or other similar commitments of oneok partners.
oneok - in march 2014, we completed the wind down of our energy services business. we expect future cash expenditures associated with the released transportation and storage capacity from the wind down of our energy services business on an after-tax basis to be approximately $45 million with approximately $23 million in 2015, $11 million in 2016, $6 million in 2017 and $5 million from 2018 through 2023.
on january 31, 2014, we completed the separation of one gas. in conjunction with the separation, the following transactions occurred in 2014:
•   one gas issued senior notes totaling $1.2 billion, generating net proceeds of approximately $1.19 billion;
•   we received a cash distribution of approximately $1.13 billion from the proceeds of the one gas senior notes offering;
•   we repaid all commercial paper outstanding, which totaled approximately $600.5 million;
•   we paid $150.0 million to retire $152.5 million of senior notes through a tender offer;
•   we called $400 million of senior notes that we repaid in march 2014 for a total of $430.1 million, which included accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date;
60
•   we recorded a loss on extinguishment of $24.8 million in other expense and reclassified losses to interest expense of $7.7 million due to the discontinuance of cash flow hedge treatment for interest-rate swaps related to the debt retirements;
•   we reduced our credit facility to $300 million from $1.2 billion; and
•   we wrote off $2.9 million of previously deferred credit agreement issuance costs to interest expense.
as a result of the separation of our former natural gas distribution business and the wind down of our energy services business, the cash flow sources and requirements for oneok have changed significantly. oneok's primary source of cash inflows are distributions to us from our general partner and limited partnership interests in oneok partners. the cash distributions that we expect to receive from oneok partners are expected to provide sufficient resources to finance our operations and quarterly cash dividends. our next long-term debt maturity is in 2022.
oneok partners - part of oneok partners' strategy is to grow through internally generated growth projects and acquisitions that strengthen and complement its existing assets. it relies primarily on operating cash flows, commercial paper, bank credit facilities, debt issuances and the issuance of common units for its liquidity and capital resources requirements. it funds its operating expenses, debt service and cash distributions to its limited partners and general partner primarily with operating cash flows. capital expenditures are funded by operating cash flows, short- and long-term debt and issuances of equity. it expects to continue to use these sources for liquidity and capital resource needs on both a short- and long-term basis. oneok partners has no guarantees of debt or other similar commitments to unaffiliated parties.
while oneok partners' net margin is primarily derived from fee-based contracts, a portion of its net margin is dependent upon the prevailing and future prices for ngls, crude oil and natural gas. commodity prices are dependent on numerous factors beyond its control, such as overall crude oil and natural gas supply and demand and inventories in relevant markets, economic conditions, the global political environment, regulatory developments and competition from other energy sources. these commodity prices historically have been volatile and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future. for example, wti crude oil prices declined to less than $50.00 per barrel in early 2015, compared with approximately $90.00 per barrel in september 2014. nymex natural gas prices also declined to approximately $3.00 per mmbtu in early 2015, compared with prices in excess of $4.00 per mmbtu in september 2014.
oneok partners uses hedges to partially mitigate its near-term sensitivity to fluctuations in the natural gas, crude oil and ngl prices received for its equity volumes. as of february 2015, it had hedged 80 percent, 33 percent and 44 percent of its expected 2015 equity natural gas, ngl and condensate volumes, respectively. currently, it does not have hedges in place for any of its expected equity volumes beyond 2015.
we expect the energy commodity price environment to remain depressed for at least the near term, which has caused crude oil and natural gas producers to announce plans for reduced drilling for crude oil and natural gas, which we expect will slow volume growth, or reduce the volumes of natural gas and ngls delivered on to oneok partners' systems. these conditions are expected to adversely impact oneok partners' results of operations and cash flows. if the current energy commodity price environment persists for a prolonged period or declines further, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
oneok partners continues to have access to the oneok partners credit agreement, which it expects to be adequate to fund short-term liquidity needs. in february 2015, oneok partners notified its lenders of its intent to exercise its option to increase the capacity of the facility to an aggregate of $2.4 billion by increased commitments from existing lenders and/or commitments from one or more new lenders, which is pending lenders' approval. while oneok partners' lenders are not obligated to increase the capacity of the facility, it expects to receive sufficient commitments to increase the facility to $2.4 billion.
if the low commodity prices persist throughout 2015, we expect it to have an adverse impact on oneok partners' volumes and margins. oneok partners is responding by aligning its operating costs and capital-growth projects with the needs of crude oil and natural gas producers, which includes suspending, reducing or eliminating certain capital-growth projects; limiting increases of distributions to its limited partners and negotiating various contract enhancements. oneok partners continues to seek opportunities to convert its pop contracts to fee-based contracts or increase the fee component in its pop contracts.
oneok partners' ability to continue to access capital markets for debt and equity financing under reasonable terms depends on its financial condition, credit ratings and market conditions. the recent decline in commodity prices has resulted in a decrease in its common unit price, which is expected to increase its debt and equity financing costs. while lower commodity prices and industry uncertainty may result in increased financing costs, it believes it has sufficient access to the financial resources and liquidity necessary to meet its requirements for working capital, debt service payments and capital expenditures.
61
during 2014, oneok partners utilized cash from operations, its commercial paper program and proceeds from its equity issuances, including its may 2014 equity offering and "at-the-market" equity program, to fund its short-term liquidity needs and capital projects. see discussion under "short-term liquidity" and "long-term financing" for more information.
cash management - we and oneok partners each use similar centralized cash management programs that concentrate the cash assets of their operating subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purposes of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing, transaction costs and bank fees. both centralized cash management programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of the operating subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the respective consolidated groups. oneok partners' operating subsidiaries participate in these programs to the extent they are permitted pursuant to ferc regulations or their operating agreements. under these cash management programs, depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short-term cash surpluses or cash requirements, we and oneok partners provide cash to their respective subsidiaries or the subsidiaries provide cash to them.
separation of natural gas distribution business - prior to and in anticipation of the separation, one gas, which at the time was our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into debt and credit agreements. upon completion of the separation on january 31, 2014, oneok's obligations related to the one gas credit agreement and debt issuance terminated.
short-term liquidity - oneok's source of short-term liquidity is quarterly distributions from oneok partners and cash on hand. we have access to our $300 million oneok credit agreement, which had $298.1 million of credit available at december 31, 2014, but do not expect to draw upon the facility. we terminated our commercial paper program in february 2014. at december 31, 2014, oneok had no short-term debt outstanding.
oneok partners' principal sources of short-term liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities, distributions received from its equity-method investments and proceeds from its commercial paper program. to the extent commercial paper is unavailable, the oneok partners credit agreement may be used.
the weighted-average interest rate at december 31, 2014, on oneok partners' short-term borrowings was 0.54 percent. based on the forward libor curve, we expect the interest rates on oneok partners' short-term borrowings to increase in 2015, compared with interest rates on amounts outstanding at december 31, 2014.
oneok credit agreement - effective january 31, 2014, the oneok credit agreement was amended and restated to reduce available capacity to $300 million from $1.2 billion and to amend certain other provisions.
in february 2014, oneok repaid all commercial paper outstanding. at december 31, 2014, oneok had $1.9 million in letters of credit issued under the oneok credit agreement and approximately $130.3 million of cash and cash equivalents.  oneok had approximately $298.1 million of credit available at december 31, 2014, under the oneok credit agreement.
the oneok credit agreement is a $300 million revolving credit facility and contains certain financial, operational and legal covenants.  among other things, these covenants include maintaining a ratio of indebtedness to consolidated ebitda (ebitda, as defined in the oneok credit agreement) of no more than 4.0 to 1.  upon breach of certain covenants by us in the oneok credit agreement, amounts outstanding under our oneok credit agreement, if any, may become due and payable immediately. at december 31, 2014, oneok's ratio of indebtedness to consolidated ebitda was 2.3 to 1, and oneok was in compliance with all covenants under the oneok credit agreement.
the oneok credit agreement also includes a $50 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $50 million sublimit for swingline loans.  under the terms of the oneok credit agreement, oneok may request an increase in the size of the facility to an aggregate of $500 million from $300 million by either commitments from new lenders or increased commitments from existing lenders.  the oneok credit agreement contains provisions for an applicable margin rate and an annual facility fee, both of which adjust with changes in our credit rating. based on our current credit rating, borrowings, if any, will accrue interest at libor plus 125 basis points, and the annual facility fee is 25 basis points.
oneok partners credit agreement - the total amount of short-term borrowings authorized by the board of directors of oneok partners gp, the general partner of oneok partners, is $2.5 billion.  at december 31, 2014, oneok partners had $1.1 billion of commercial paper outstanding, $14.0 million of letters of credit issued, no borrowings outstanding under the oneok partners credit agreement, approximately $42.5 million of cash and approximately $630.7 million of credit available under the oneok partners credit agreement.  as of december 31, 2014, oneok partners could have issued $3.3 billion of short- and long-term debt to meet its liquidity needs under the most restrictive provisions contained in its various borrowing agreements.

the oneok partners credit agreement, which was amended and restated effective on january 31, 2014, and expires in january 2019, is a $1.7 billion revolving credit facility and includes a $100 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit, a $150 million swingline sublimit and an option to request an increase in the size of the facility to an aggregate of $2.4 billion by either commitments from new lenders or increased commitments from existing lenders. the oneok partners credit agreement is available for general partnership purposes. during the second quarter 2014, oneok partners increased the size of its commercial paper program to $1.7 billion from $1.2 billion. in addition, in february 2015, it notified its lenders of its intent to exercise its option to increase the capacity of the facility to an aggregate of $2.4 billion by increased commitments from existing lenders and/or commitments from one or more new lenders, which is pending lenders' approval. amounts outstanding under oneok partners' commercial paper program reduce the borrowing capacity under the oneok partners credit agreement.
the oneok partners credit agreement contains provisions for an applicable margin rate and an annual facility fee, both of which adjust with changes in oneok partners' credit rating. under the terms of the oneok partners credit agreement, based on oneok partners' current credit rating, borrowings, if any, will accrue at libor plus 117.5 basis points, and the annual facility fee is 20 basis points. the oneok partners credit agreement is guaranteed fully and unconditionally by oneok partners' wholly owned subsidiary, the intermediate partnership. borrowings under the oneok partners credit agreement are nonrecourse to oneok, and oneok does not guarantee oneok partners' debt, commercial paper or other similar commitments.
the oneok partners credit agreement contains certain financial, operational and legal covenants. among other things, these covenants include maintaining a ratio of indebtedness to adjusted ebitda (ebitda, as defined in the oneok partners credit agreement, adjusted for all noncash charges and increased for projected ebitda from certain lender-approved capital expansion projects) of no more than 5.0 to 1. if oneok partners consummates one or more acquisitions in which the aggregate purchase price is $25 million or more, the allowable ratio of indebtedness to adjusted ebitda will be increased to 5.5 to 1 for the quarter in which the acquisition was completed and the two following quarters.  as a result of the west texas lpg acquisition oneok partners completed in the fourth quarter 2014, the allowable ratio of indebtedness to adjusted ebitda increased to 5.5 to 1 through the second quarter 2015. if oneok partners were to breach certain covenants in the oneok partners credit agreement, amounts outstanding under the oneok partners credit agreement, if any, may become due and payable immediately. at december 31, 2014, oneok partners' ratio of indebtedness to adjusted ebitda was 3.7 to 1, and oneok partners was in compliance with all covenants under the oneok partners credit agreement.
financing for the west texas lpg acquisition came from available cash on hand and borrowings under oneok partners' existing $1.7 billion commercial paper program. see additional discussion of this acquisition in the "financial results and operating information" section in the natural gas liquids segment.
long-term financing - we do not expect to issue additional equity or long-term notes, as our next debt maturity is not until 2022 and our operating cash requirements are expected to be funded by cash distributions received from oneok partners. therefore, changes in the debt and equity markets are not expected to impact our financing requirements.
oneok partners expects to fund its longer-term cash requirements by issuing common units or long-term notes. other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuance of convertible debt securities, asset securitization, and the sale and lease back of facilities.
oneok partners is subject to changes in the debt and equity markets, and there is no assurance it will be able or willing to access the public or private markets in the future. oneok partners may choose to meet its cash requirements by utilizing some combination of cash flows from operations, borrowing under its commercial paper program or the oneok partners credit agreement, altering the timing of controllable expenditures, restricting future acquisitions and capital projects, or pursuing other debt or equity financing alternatives. some of these alternatives could result in higher costs or negatively affect their respective credit ratings, among other factors. based on oneok partners' general financial condition, market expectations regarding its future earnings and projected cash flows, and oneok partners' investment-grade credit ratings, we expect oneok partners will be able to meet its cash requirements and maintain its investment-grade credit ratings.
oneok debt issuance - in january 2012, we completed an underwritten public offering of $700 million, 4.25 percent senior notes due 2022. the net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expense, or approximately $694.3 million were used to repay amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes.
63
oneok debt repayment - in february 2014, we retired approximately $152.5 million, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, of our 4.25 percent senior notes due 2022 through a tender offer. the total amount paid, including fees and other charges, was approximately $150.0 million.
in february 2014, we called our $400 million, 5.2 percent senior notes due in 2015. the full repayment occurred in march 2014 and was $430.1 million, including accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date.
we recorded a loss on extinguishment of $24.8 million related to the early retirement of long-term debt, which is included in other expense in our consolidated statements of income. we reclassified a loss of $4.6 million, net of tax of $3.1 million, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for terminated cash flow hedges related to the debt retirements, which is included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of income.
oneok partners' debt issuances - in september 2013, oneok partners completed an underwritten public offering of $1.25 billion of senior notes, consisting of $425 million, 3.2 percent senior notes due 2018, $425 million, 5.0 percent senior notes due 2023 and $400 million, 6.2 percent senior notes due 2043. a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of approximately $1.24 billion was used to repay amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program, and the balance was used for general partnership purposes, including but not limited to capital expenditures and acquisitions.

oneok partners' equity issuances - in may 2014, oneok partners completed an underwritten public offering of approximately 13.9 million common units at a public offering price of $52.94 per common unit, generating net proceeds of approximately $714.5 million. in conjunction with this issuance, we contributed approximately $15.0 million in order to maintain our 2 percent general partner interest in oneok partners. oneok partners used the proceeds to repay commercial paper outstanding, fund capital expenditures and for general partnership purposes.
oneok partners has an "at-the-market" equity program for the offer and sale from time to time of its common units. in november 2014, oneok partners entered into an equity distribution agreement in the aggregate amount of $650 million. the program allows oneok partners to offer and sell its common units at prices it deems appropriate through a sales agent. sales of common units are made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the nyse, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed to between oneok partners and the sales agent. oneok partners is under no obligation to offer and sell common units under the program. during 2014, oneok partners utilized the remainder of its previous equity distribution agreement in the aggregate amount of $300 million. at december 31, 2014, oneok partners had approximately $514 million of registered common units available for issuance under its "at-the-market" equity program.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, oneok partners sold approximately 7.9 million common units through its "at-the-market" equity program. the gross proceeds, including oneok partners gp's contribution to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest in oneok partners, were approximately $408.1 million. net cash proceeds, after deducting agent commissions and other related costs, were approximately $402.1 million, which were used for general partnership purposes.
as a result of these transactions, our aggregate ownership interest in oneok partners decreased to 37.8 percent at december 31, 2014, from 41.2 percent at december 31, 2013.
in august 2013, oneok partners completed an underwritten public offering of 11.5 million common units at a public offering price of $49.61 per common unit, generating net proceeds of approximately $553.4 million.  in conjunction with this issuance, we contributed approximately $11.6 million in order to maintain our 2 percent general partner interest in oneok partners. oneok partners used a portion of the proceeds to repay amount outstanding under its commercial paper program and the balance was used for other general partnership purposes.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, oneok partners sold approximately 681 thousand common units through its "at-the-market" equity program. the gross proceeds, including oneok partners gp's contribution to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest in oneok partners, were approximately $36.6 million. net cash proceeds, after deducting agent commissions and other related costs, were approximately $36.1 million, which were used for general partnership purposes.
in march 2012, oneok partners completed an underwritten public offering of 8.0 million common units at a public offering price of $59.27 per common unit, generating net proceeds of approximately $460 million. oneok partners also sold 8.0
64
million common units to us in a private placement, generating net proceeds of approximately $460 million. in conjunction with the issuances, oneok partners gp contributed approximately $19 million in order to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest in oneok partners. oneok partners used the net proceeds from the issuances to repay $295 million of borrowings under its commercial paper program, to repay amounts on the maturity of its $350 million, 5.9 percent senior notes due in april 2012 and for other general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures.
interest-rate swaps - oneok partners has entered into forward-starting interest-rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payments on a portion of forecasted debt issuances that may result from changes in the benchmark interest rate before the debt is issued. at december 31, 2014, oneok partners had forward-starting interest-rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $900 million that were designated as cash flow hedges of which $400 million have settlement dates of more than 12 months and $500 million have settlement dates of less than 12 months.
capital expenditures - oneok's capital expenditures are financed through operating cash flows following the separation of the natural gas distribution business. oneok partners' capital expenditures are financed typically through operating cash flows, short- and long-term debt and the issuance of equity.  consolidated capital expenditures were $1.8 billion, $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  of these amounts, oneok partners' capital expenditures were $1.7 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  capital expenditures for 2014 decreased, compared with 2013, due primarily to the timing of expenditures on growth projects in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments and the separation of the natural gas distribution business on january 31, 2014. capital expenditures increased for 2013, compared with 2012, due primarily to growth projects in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments. the 2013 and 2012 capital expenditures reflect twelve months of capital expenditures for the natural gas distribution business.
in addition to the capital expenditures discussed above, oneok partners completed the acquisition of the west texas lpg system from affiliates of chevron corporation for approximately $800 million in november 2014. in 2013, oneok partners completed for $305 million the sage creek acquisition of certain natural gas gathering and processing, and natural gas liquids facilities in converse and campbell counties, wyoming, in the ngl-rich niobrara shale formation of the powder river basin. oneok partners also acquired the remaining 30 percent undivided interest in the maysville, oklahoma, natural gas processing facility for $90 million during 2013. for additional discussion, see note c to the notes to consolidated financial statements.
the following table sets forth oneok partners' 2015 projected capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions and afudc:
2015 projected capital expenditures
(millions of dollars)
natural gas gathering and processing                  $761
natural gas liquids                                    311
natural gas pipelines                                  139
other                                                   16
total projected capital expenditures                $1,227
projected 2015 capital expenditures are lower than 2014 capital expenditures due to suspending certain growth capital expenditures as discussed in "growth projects" in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments in financial results and operating information.  oneok partners has approximately $2.1 billion to $3.0 billion of projects in various stages of construction, including approximately $2.2 billion in new projects and acquisitions announced in 2014.  it expects to continue to finance future capital expenditures with a combination of operating cash flows, short- and long-term debt and the issuance of common units unconsolidated affiliates - the overland pass pipeline company limited liability company agreement provides that distributions to overland pass pipeline company's members are to be made on a pro rata basis according to each member's ownership interest. the overland pass pipeline company management committee determines the amount and timing of such distributions. any changes to, or suspension of, cash distributions from overland pass pipeline company requires the unanimous approval of the overland pass pipeline management committee. cash distributions are equal to 100 percent of available cash as defined in the limited liability company agreement.
the northern border pipeline partnership agreement provides that distributions to northern border pipeline's partners are to be made on a pro rata basis according to each partner's percentage interest. the northern border pipeline management committee determines the amount and timing of such distributions. any changes to, or suspension of, the cash distribution policy of northern border pipeline requires the unanimous approval of the northern border pipeline management committee.
65
cash distributions are equal to 100 percent of distributable cash flow as determined from northern border pipeline's financial statements based upon ebitda, less interest expense and maintenance capital expenditures. loans or other advances from northern border pipeline to its partners or affiliates are prohibited under its credit agreement.
west texas lpg pipeline - the limited partnership agreement of west texas lpg pipeline limited partnership (wtlpg) provides that distributions to the partners are to be made on a pro rata basis according to each partner's ownership interest. cash distributions to the partners for a calendar quarter are currently declared and paid by wtlpg in the next succeeding calendar quarter. any changes to, or suspension of, the cash distributions from wtlpg requires the approval of a minimum of 90 percent of the ownership interest and a minimum of two general partners of wtlpg. cash distributions are equal to 100 percent of distributable cash as defined in the limited partnership agreement of wtlpg.
credit ratings - oneok and oneok partners' credit ratings as of january 16, 2015, are shown in the table below:
oneok                  oneok partners rating agency   rating       outlook   rating          outlook moody's         baa3         stable    baa2            stable s&amp;p         bb+          stable    bbb             stable oneok terminated its commercial paper program following the separation of the natural gas distribution business. oneok continues to have access to the oneok credit agreement, which expires in january 2019.  oneok's rating was downgraded to baa3 by moody's and bb+ by s&p in february 2014 to reflect the separation of our natural gas distribution business.
oneok partners' commercial paper program is rated prime-2 by moody's and a-2 by s&p. oneok partners' credit ratings, which are currently investment grade, may be affected by a material change in financial ratios or a material event affecting its business and industry. the most common criteria for assessment of oneok partners' credit ratings are the debt-to-ebitda ratio, interest coverage, business risk profile and liquidity.
in february 2014, s&p affirmed oneok partners' current rating and revised its outlook to stable. however, recent declines in the energy commodity price environment and potential adverse impacts on oneok partners' results of operations and cash flows could cause the credit rating agencies to downgrade its credit ratings. if oneok partners' credit ratings were downgraded, the cost to borrow funds under its commercial paper program and credit agreement would increase, or oneok partners potentially could lose access to the commercial paper market. in the event that oneok partners is unable to borrow funds under its commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in its business, oneok partners would continue to have access to the oneok partners credit agreement, which expires in january 2019. an adverse credit rating change alone is not a default under the oneok credit agreement or the oneok partners credit agreement. a downgrade in oneok partners' credit ratings could also result in a downgrade to oneok's credit ratings. however, we would not expect a downgrade to our credit ratings to have a material impact on our results of operations.
in the normal course of business, oneok partners' counterparties provide secured and unsecured credit. in the event of a downgrade in oneok partners' credit ratings or a significant change in oneok partners' counterparties' evaluation of its creditworthiness, oneok partners could be required to provide additional collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments as a condition of continuing to conduct business with such counterparties. oneok partners may be required to fund margin requirements with its counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments. there were no financial derivative instruments with contingent features related to credit risk that were in a net liability position at december 31, 2014.
oneok partners cash distributions - oneok partners distributes 100 percent of its available cash-as defined in its partnership agreement that generally consists of all cash receipts less adjustments for cash disbursements and net change to reserves-to its general and limited partners.  distributions are allocated to the general partner and limited partners according to their partnership percentages of 2 percent and 98 percent, respectively.  the effect of any incremental allocations for incentive distributions to the general partner are calculated after the allocation to the general partner's partnership interest and before the allocation to the limited partners.
commodity prices - oneok partners is subject to commodity price volatility. significant fluctuations in commodity prices will impact its overall liquidity due to the affect commodity price changes have on its cash flows from operating activities, including the impact on working capital for ngls and natural gas held in storage, margin requirements and certain energy-related receivables. the recent decline in commodity prices has contributed to a decrease of oneok partners' unit price. while lower commodity prices and industry uncertainty may increase debt and equity financing costs, oneok partners
66
expects to have sufficient liquidity to finance its announced capital growth projects. oneok partners believes that its available credit and cash and cash equivalents are adequate to meet liquidity requirements associated with commodity price volatility. see discussion under "commodity price risk" in part i, item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in our annual report, for information on oneok partners' hedging activities.
pension and postretirement benefit plans - information about our pension and postretirement benefits plans, including anticipated contributions, is included under note n of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
during 2014, we made no contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, and $2.0 million in contributions to our postretirement benefit plans for both continuing and discontinued operations.  the contributions to our postretirement benefit plans were attributable to the 2014 plan year.  we expect to make $1.5 million in contributions to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2015.
cash flow analysis we use the indirect method to prepare our consolidated statements of cash flows. under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but do not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period and for operating cash items that do not impact net income. these reconciling items include depreciation and amortization, allowance for equity funds used during construction, gain or loss on sale of assets, equity earnings from investments, distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates, deferred income taxes, share-based compensation expense, other amounts, and changes in our assets and liabilities not classified as investing or financing activities.
the following table sets forth the changes in cash flows by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated:
years ended december 31,
2014                    2013                    2012
(millions of dollars)
total cash provided by (used in):
operating activities                                                             $1,285.6                $1,294.8                  $984.0
investing activities                                                             (2,566.2    )           (2,642.0    )           (1,814.2    )
financing activities                                                              1,304.5                   912.9                 1,339.0
change in cash and cash equivalents                                                  23.9                  (434.3    )              508.8
change in cash and cash equivalents included in discontinued operations               3.3                     2.9                    11.5
change in cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations                       27.2                  (431.4    )              520.3
cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period                                    145.6                   577.0                    56.7
cash and cash equivalents at end of period                                         $172.8                  $145.6                  $577.0
operating cash flows - operating cash flows are affected by earnings from our business activities. changes in commodity prices and demand for our services or products, whether because of general economic conditions, changes in supply, changes in demand for the end products that are made with our products or increased competition from other service providers, could affect our earnings and operating cash flows.
2014 vs. 2013 - cash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities, were approximately $1,227.3 million in 2014 compared with $1,302.0 million 2013. the decrease was due primarily to 2013 operating activities including a full year of operations of our former natural gas distribution business, which was separated from oneok on january 31, 2014, as discussed in note b, offset partially by higher operating income from oneok partners, as discussed in "financial results and operating information."
the changes in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by approximately $58.3 million in 2014, compared with a decrease of $7.2 million in 2013. the increase was due primarily to the collection and payment of trade receivables and payables, resulting from the timing of cash collections from customers and paid to vendors and suppliers, which vary from period to period. this change is also due to the change in ngl volumes in storage. these increases were offset partially by higher settlements of liabilities associated with the wind down of our former energy services business and higher imbalances.
67
2013 vs. 2012 - cash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities, were approximately $1,302.0 million in 2013 compared with $1,290.2 million in 2012. the increase was due primarily to changes in net margin and operating expenses as discussed in "financial results and operating information."
the changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flows by approximately $7.2 million in 2013, compared with a decrease of $306.2 million in 2012. the increase was due primarily to the settlement of interest-rate swaps associated with oneok's $700 million debt issuance in january 2012. the change also was affected by the collection and payment of trade receivables and payables, resulting from the timing of cash collections from customers and payments to vendors and suppliers, which vary from period to period.
investing cash flows - cash used in investing activities decreased for 2014, compared with 2013, due primarily to decreased capital expenditures due to the separation of one gas and lower oneok partners capital expenditures primarily in the natural gas liquids segment, due to the timing of expenditures, offset partially by the acquisition of the west texas lpg system.
cash used in investing activities increased for 2013, compared with 2012, due primarily to increased capital expenditures on oneok partners' growth projects in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments, as well as expenditures for the sage creek acquisition and the remaining 30 percent interest in the maysville, oklahoma, natural gas processing facility.
financing cash flows - cash provided by financing activities increased for 2014, compared with 2013. the increases were due primarily to the issuance of $1.2 billion of one gas debt, higher issuances of oneok partners common units and oneok partners' borrowings of notes payable associated with completing the west texas lpg acquisition. this was offset partially by oneok's repayment of long-term debt from the proceeds received from one gas. cash flows also were affected by increased distributions from oneok partners to noncontrolling interests and increased oneok dividends in 2014, compared with 2013.
cash provided by financing activities decreased for 2013, compared with 2012, due primarily to oneok's january 2012 debt issuance; oneok partners issued a similar amount of debt in both periods. this was offset partially by higher repayment of debt and higher issuance of oneok partners' common units in 2013. cash flows also were affected by increased distributions from oneok partners to noncontrolling interests and increased oneok dividends in 2013, compared with 2012.
impact of new accounting standards information about the impact of new accounting standards is included in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates.
the following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies, which are defined as those estimates and policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requiring management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make estimates concerning the impact of inherently uncertain matters. we have discussed the development and selection of our estimates and critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors.
derivatives and risk-management activities - we and oneok partners utilize derivatives to reduce our market risk exposure to commodity price and interest-rate fluctuations and to achieve more predictable cash flows.  the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship.  when possible, we implement effective hedging strategies using derivative financial instruments that qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. we have not used derivative instruments for trading purposes.
for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss from a change in fair value of the derivative instrument is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted transaction affects
68
earnings, at which time the fair value of the derivative instrument is reclassified into earnings.  the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is recognized in earnings.
we assess the effectiveness of hedging relationships quarterly by performing an effectiveness test on our hedging relationships to determine whether they are highly effective on a retrospective and prospective basis.  we do not believe that changes in our fair value estimates of our derivative instruments have a material impact on our results of operations, as the majority of our derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges for which ineffectiveness is not material. however, if a derivative instrument is ineligible for cash flow hedge accounting or if we fail to appropriately designate it as a cash flow hedge, changes in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recorded currently in earnings.  additionally, if a cash flow hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting treatment because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recognized in earnings.  for more information on commodity price sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
see notes d and e of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional discussion of fair value measurements and derivatives and risk management activities.
impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, including intangible assets - we assess our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually as of july 1. our goodwill impairment analysis performed as of july 1, 2014, did not result in an impairment charge nor did our analysis reflect any reporting units at risk, and subsequent to that date, no event has occurred indicating that the implied fair value of each of our reporting units (including its inherent goodwill) is less than the carrying value of its net assets. there were also no impairment charges resulting from our 2013 annual impairment test.
as a result of the decline in natural gas prices and its effect on location and seasonal price differentials, we performed an interim impairment assessment of our former energy services business' goodwill balance as of march 31, 2012. as a result of that assessment, goodwill with a carrying amount of $10.3 million was written down to its implied fair value of zero, with a resulting impairment charge of $10.3 million recorded in 2012 earnings, which is included in income from discontinued operations. there were no impairment indicators for oneok partners or for our former natural gas distribution business as the cash flows generated from each of these businesses are derived from predominately fee-based, nondiscretionary services.
as part of our goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors (including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance) to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. if further testing is necessary, we perform a two-step impairment test for goodwill. in the first step, an initial assessment is made by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. if the fair value is less than the book value, an impairment is indicated, and we must perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment. in the second test, we calculate the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value determined in step one of the assessment. if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we will record an impairment charge.
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use two generally accepted valuation approaches, an income approach and a market approach, using assumptions consistent with a market participant's perspective. under the income approach, we use anticipated cash flows over a period of years plus a terminal value and discount these amounts to their present value using appropriate discount rates. under the market approach, we apply ebitda multiples to forecasted ebitda. the multiples used are consistent with historical asset transactions. the forecasted cash flows are based on average forecasted cash flows for a reporting unit over a period of years.
the following table sets forth our goodwill, by segment, for the periods indicated:

as part of our indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors similar to those considered in the goodwill impairment test to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. if further testing is necessary, we compare the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset with its book value. the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset is estimated using the market approach. under the market approach, we apply multiples to forecasted cash flows of the assets associated with our indefinite-lived intangible asset. the multiples used are consistent with historical asset transactions. after assessing qualitative factors, we determined that there were no impairments to our indefinite-lived intangible asset in 2014. there were also no impairment charges resulting from our 2013 or 2012 annual impairment tests.
we assess our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. an impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. if an impairment is indicated, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset. we determined that there were no asset impairments in 2014, 2013 or 2012.
for the investments we account for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary.  therefore, we periodically reevaluate the amount at which we carry our equity method investments to determine whether current events or circumstances warrant adjustments to our carrying value. we determined that there were no impairments to our investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2013 or 2012.
historically, low natural gas prices and the relatively higher crude oil and ngl prices compared with natural gas on a heating-value basis have caused producers primarily to focus development efforts on crude oil and ngl-rich supply basins rather than areas with dry natural gas production, such as coal-bed methane areas in the powder river basin.  the reduced coal-bed methane development activities and natural production declines in the dry natural gas formations of the powder river basin have resulted in lower natural gas volumes available to be gathered.  while the reserve potential in the dry natural gas formations of the powder river basin still exists, future drilling and development in this area will be affected by commodity prices and producers' alternative prospects.
during 2014, the volumes gathered on the bighorn gas gathering system, in which oneok partners owns a 49 percent equity interest and which operates in the coal-bed methane area of the powder river basin, declined at a rate greater than in prior periods and greater than expected. due to these additional declines in volumes, bighorn gas gathering recorded an impairment of its underlying assets in september 2014, when the operator determined that the volume decline would be sustained for the foreseeable future. as a result of these developments, oneok partners reviewed its equity method investment in bighorn gas gathering for impairment and recorded noncash impairment charges totaling $76.4 million related to bighorn gas gathering. the noncash impairment charges are included in equity earnings from investments in our accompanying consolidated statements of income. the net book value of oneok partners' equity method investment in bighorn gas gathering is $7.9 million at december 31, 2014, and no equity method goodwill remains.
a continued decline in volumes gathered in the coal-bed methane area of the powder river basin may reduce oneok partners' ability to recover the carrying value of its equity investments in this area and could result in additional noncash charges to earnings. the net book value of oneok partners' remaining equity method investments in this dry natural gas area is $206.0 million, which includes $130.5 million of equity method goodwill. we expect the energy commodity price environment to remain depressed for at least the near term, which has caused producers to announce plans for reduced drilling for crude oil and natural gas, which we expect will slow volume growth or reduce volumes of natural gas delivered to systems owned by its equity method investments.
our impairment tests require the use of assumptions and estimates such as industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to future impairment charges.
see notes f, g and p of the notes to consolidated financial statements for our long-lived assets, goodwill and equity-method investments disclosures.
pension and postretirement employee benefits - we have a defined benefit retirement plan covering certain full-time employees. we sponsor welfare plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain employees who retire with at least five years of service. our actuarial consultant calculates the expense and liability related to these plans and uses statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events. these factors include assumptions about the discount
70
rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, age and employment periods. in determining the projected benefit obligations and costs, assumptions can change from period to period and may result in material changes in the costs and liabilities we recognize. see note n of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information.
during 2014, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $21.5 million related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefits plans in continuing operations.
in connection with the separation of the natural gas distribution business, oneok entered into an employee matters agreement with one gas, which provides that employees of one gas no longer participate in benefit plans sponsored or maintained by oneok, as of january 1, 2014. the oneok defined benefit pension plan and postretirement benefit plans transferred an allocable portion of assets and obligations related to those employees transferring to one gas to newly established trusts for the one gas plans. this resulted in a decrease in oneok's sponsored qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement plan obligations of approximately $1.1 billion and a decrease in oneok's sponsored pension and postretirement plan assets of approximately $1.0 billion. additionally, as a result of the transfer of unrecognized losses to one gas, oneok's deferred income taxes and regulatory assets decreased approximately $86.0 million and $331.1 million, respectively.
we estimate that in 2015, we will record net periodic benefit costs of $21.6 million related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefits plans.
the following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to determine our estimated 2015 net periodic benefit cost related to our defined benefit pension plans, and sensitivity to changes with respect to these assumptions.
rate used   costsensitivity (a)              obligationsensitivity (b)
(millions of dollars)

expected long-term return on plan assets        8.0%   $0.6                             $-
(a) - approximate impact a quarter percentage point decrease in the assumed rate would have on net periodic pension costs.
(b) - approximate impact a quarter percentage point decrease in the assumed rate would have on defined benefit pension obligation.
a quarter percentage point change in either of the assumed rates would not have a significant impact on our postretirement benefit plan costs or obligation. assumed health care cost-trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for our postretirement benefit plans. a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:
one percentagepoint increase              one percentagepoint decrease
(millions of dollars)
effect on total of service and interest cost   $0.3                                      $(0.2                   )
effect on postretirement benefit obligation    $1.1                                      $(1.1                   )
during 2014, we made no contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and $2.0 million in contributions to our postretirement benefit plans for our continuing operations. at december 31, 2014, we expect to make $1.5 million in contributions to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2015.
contingencies - our accounting for contingencies covers a variety of business activities, including contingencies for legal and environmental exposures. we accrue these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered and an amount can be reasonably estimated. we expense legal fees as incurred and base our legal liability estimates on currently available facts and our assessments of the ultimate outcome or resolution. accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than the completion of a remediation feasibility study. recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. our expenditures for environmental evaluation, mitigation, remediation and compliance to date have not been significant in relation to our financial position or results of operations, and our expenditures related to environmental matters had no material effect on earnings or cash flows during 2014, 2013 and 2012. actual results may differ from our estimates resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on earnings. see note r of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional discussion of contingencies.

forward-looking statements some of the statements contained and incorporated in this annual report are forward-looking statements as defined under federal securities laws.  the forward-looking statements relate to our anticipated financial performance (including projected operating income, net income, capital expenditures, cash flow and projected levels of dividends), liquidity, management's plans and objectives for our future growth projects and other future operations (including plans to construct additional natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines and processing facilities and related cost estimates), our business prospects, the outcome of regulatory and legal proceedings, market conditions and other matters.  we make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under federal securities legislation and other applicable laws.  the following discussion is intended to identify important factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
forward-looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, the information concerning possible or assumed future results of our operations and other statements contained or incorporated in this annual report identified by words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "should," "goal," "forecast," "guidance," "could," "may," "continue," "might," "potential," "scheduled," and other words and terms of similar meaning.
one should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.  known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements.  those factors may affect our operations, markets, products, services and prices.  in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with the forward-looking statements, factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statement include, among others, the following:
•   the effects of weather and other natural phenomena, including climate change, on our operations, demand for our services and energy prices;
•   competition from other united states and foreign energy suppliers and transporters, as well as alternative forms of energy, including, but not limited to, solar power, wind power, geothermal energy and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel;
•   the capital intensive nature of our businesses;
•   the profitability of assets or businesses acquired or constructed by us;
•   our ability to make cost-saving changes in operations;
•   risks of marketing, trading and hedging activities, including the risks of changes in energy prices or the financial condition of our counterparties;
•   the uncertainty of estimates, including accruals and costs of environmental remediation;
•   the timing and extent of changes in energy commodity prices;
•   the effects of changes in governmental policies and regulatory actions, including changes with respect to income and other taxes, pipeline safety, environmental compliance, climate change initiatives and authorized rates of recovery of natural gas and natural gas transportation costs;
•   the impact on drilling and production by factors beyond our control, including the demand for natural gas and crude oil; producers' desire and ability to obtain necessary permits; reserve performance; and capacity constraints on the pipelines that transport crude oil, natural gas and ngls from producing areas and our facilities;
•   changes in demand for the use of natural gas, ngls and crude oil because of market conditions caused by concerns about climate change;
•   the impact of unforeseen changes in interest rates, equity markets, inflation rates, economic recession and other external factors over which we have no control, including the effect on pension and postretirement expense and funding resulting from changes in stock and bond market returns;
•   our indebtedness could make us vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limit our ability to borrow additional funds and/or place us at competitive disadvantages compared with our competitors that have less debt, or have other adverse consequences;
•   actions by rating agencies concerning the credit ratings of oneok and oneok partners;
•   the results of administrative proceedings and litigation, regulatory actions, rule changes and receipt of expected clearances involving any local, state or federal regulatory body, including the ferc, the national transportation safety board, the phmsa, the epa and cftc;
•   our ability to access capital at competitive rates or on terms acceptable to us;
73
•   risks associated with adequate supply to our gathering, processing, fractionation and pipeline facilities, including production declines that outpace new drilling or extended periods of ethane rejection;
•   the risk that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting could emerge or that minor problems could become significant;
•   the impact and outcome of pending and future litigation;
•   the ability to market pipeline capacity on favorable terms, including the effects of:
-   future demand for and prices of natural gas, ngls and crude oil;

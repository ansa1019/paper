item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
executive summary key strategic goals at pnc we manage our company for the long term. we are focused on the fundamentals of growing customers, loans, deposits and fee revenue and improving profitability, while investing for the future and managing risk, expenses and capital. we continue to invest in our products, markets and brand, and embrace our corporate responsibility to the communities where we do business.
we strive to expand and deepen customer relationships by offering a broad range of deposit, fee-based and credit products and services. we are focused on delivering those products and services where, when and how our customers choose with the goal of offering insight that addresses their specific needs. our approach is concentrated on organically growing and deepening client relationships that meet our risk/return measures. our strategies for growing fee income across our lines of business are focused on achieving deeper market penetration and cross selling our diverse product mix.
our strategic priorities are designed to enhance value over the long term. a key priority is to drive growth in acquired and underpenetrated geographic markets, including in the southeast. in addition, we are seeking to attract more of the investable assets of new and existing clients. pnc is focused on transforming our retail banking business to a more customer-centric and sustainable model while lowering delivery costs as customer banking preferences evolve. we are also working to build a stronger residential mortgage banking business with the goal of becoming the provider of choice for our customers. additionally, we continue to focus on expense management while investing in technology and business infrastructure and streamlining our processes.
our capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment, maintain appropriate capital in light of economic uncertainty and the basel iii framework and return excess capital to shareholders, in accordance with the capital plan included in our 2015 comprehensive capital analysis and review (ccar) submission to the board of governors of the federal reserve system (federal reserve). we continue to maintain a strong capital position and expect to build capital through retention of future earnings net of dividend payments and share repurchases. pnc has increased its liquidity positions at both pnc and pnc bank, national association (pnc bank). for more detail, see the capital and liquidity actions portion of this executive summary, the capital portion of the consolidated balance sheet review section and the liquidity risk management portion of the risk management section of this item 7 and the supervision and regulation section in item 1 business of this report.
pnc faces a variety of risks that may impact various aspects of our risk profile from time to time. the extent of such impacts may vary depending on factors such as the current economic, political and regulatory environment, merger and acquisition activity and operational challenges. many of these risks and our risk management strategies are described in more detail elsewhere in this report.
recent market and industry developments there have been numerous legislative and regulatory developments and significant changes in the competitive landscape of our industry over the last several years. the united states and other governments have undertaken major reform of the regulation of the financial services industry, including engaging in new efforts to impose requirements designed to strengthen the stability of the financial system and protect consumers and investors. the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (dodd-frank), enacted in july 2010, mandates the most wide-ranging overhaul of financial industry regulation in decades. many parts of the law are now in effect, and others are now in the implementation stage, which is likely to continue for several years. we expect to face further increased regulation of our industry as a result of dodd-frank as well as other current and future initiatives intended to enhance the regulation of financial services companies, the stability of the financial system, the protection of consumers and investors, and the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions and markets. we also expect in many cases more intense scrutiny from our supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of laws and regulations on both the federal and state levels. compliance with new regulations will increase our costs and reduce our revenue. some new regulations may limit our ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities.
on january 20, 2015, the u.s. supreme court denied a writ of certiorari in nacs v. board of governors of the federal reserve system, with the effect that the decision of the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit in this case will stand. in march 2014, the court of appeals had upheld the federal reserves network processing rule and its interchange fee rule except as to the issue of transaction monitoring costs, which it remanded to the federal reserve for further explanation. the court of appeals decision reversed the grant of summary judgment in july 2013 by the u.s. district court for the district of columbia in favor of the plaintiffs in this case vacating these rules.

income statement highlights our performance in 2014 included the following:
                                                   net income for 2014 of $4.2 billion was stable compared with 2013, as a 4% decrease in revenue was mostly offset by a reduction in provision for credit losses and a 2% decline in noninterest expense. lower revenue in the comparison was driven by a 7% decline in net interest income, as noninterest income was essentially unchanged. for additional detail, please see the consolidated income statement review section in this item 7.

          net interest income of $8.5 billion for 2014 decreased 7% compared with 2013, as lower yields on loans and investment securities, a decline in investment securities balances and a reduction in purchase accounting accretion were partially offset by commercial and commercial real estate loan growth.

              net interest margin decreased to 3.08 % for 2014 compared to 3.57 % for 2013. the decline reflected the impact of lower loan and securities yields in the ongoing low rate environment, lower purchase accounting accretion and the impact of higher interest-earning deposits with the federal reserve bank.

the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k 33
   noninterest income was $6.9 billion for 2014 and 2013, as strong overall client fee income was offset by lower residential mortgage revenue, declines in asset valuations and reduced sales of securities.

   the provision for credit losses decreased to $273 million for 2014 compared to $643 million for 2013 due to overall credit quality improvement.

   noninterest expense was $9.5 billion for 2014, a decrease of 2% compared with 2013, primarily reflecting well managed expenses.

credit quality highlights
   asset quality trends in 2014 improved from 2013. for additional detail, see the credit risk management portion of the risk management section of this item 7.

   nonperforming assets decreased $.6 billion, or 17%, to $2.9 billion at december 31, 2014 compared to december 31, 2013. nonperforming assets to total assets were 0.83% at december 31, 2014, compared to 1.08% at december 31, 2013.

   overall loan delinquencies of $1.9 billion at december 31, 2014 decreased $.5 billion, or 22%, compared with december 31, 2013.

   the allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.63% of total loans and 133% of nonperforming loans at december 31, 2014, compared with 1.84% and
117% at december 31, 2013, respectively.

                                                    net charge-offs of $.5 billion in 2014 declined 51% compared to net charge-offs of $1.1 billion for 2013. net charge-offs were 0.27% of average loans in 2014 and 0.57% of average loans in 2013. these comparisons were impacted by alignment with interagency guidance in the first quarter of 2013 on practices for loans and lines of credit related to consumer lending. in the first quarter 2013, this alignment had the overall effect of (i) accelerating charge-offs, (ii) increasing nonperforming loans and (iii) in the case of loans accounted for under the fair value option, increasing nonaccrual loans.

balance sheet highlights
   total loans increased by $9.2 billion to $205 billion at december 31, 2014 compared to december 31, 2013.

   total commercial lending increased by $11.2 billion, or 10%, as a result of growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans.

   total consumer lending decreased $2.0 billion, or 3%, due to lower home equity, education and residential mortgage loans, partially offset by growth in automobile loans.

   total deposits increased by $11.3 billion, or 5%, to $232 billion at december 31, 2014 compared with december 31, 2013, driven by growth in transaction deposits.

   pnc further increased its liquidity position as reflected in higher deposit balances maintained with the federal reserve bank.

                        the regulatory short-term liquidity coverage ratio became effective for pnc as an advanced approaches bank beginning january 1, 2015, with a minimum phased-in requirement of 80% in 2015, calculated as of month end. the estimated pro forma ratio at december 31, 2014 exceeded 100% and 95% for pnc and pnc bank, respectively.

   pncs well-positioned balance sheet remained core funded with a loans to deposits ratio of 88% at december 31, 2014.

   the transitional basel iii common equity tier 1 capital ratio, calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to pnc during 2014, was
10.9% at december 31, 2014.

                                                  pro forma fully phased-in basel iii common equity tier 1 capital ratio increased to an estimated 10.0% at december 31, 2014 from 9.4% at december 31, 2013 based on the standardized approach rules. see the capital discussion and table 18 in the consolidated balance sheet review section of this item 7 and the december 31, 2013 capital ratio tables in the statistical information (unaudited) section in item 8 of this report for more detail.

our consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet review sections of this item 7 describe in greater detail the various items that impacted our results during 2014 and 2013 and balances at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively.
capital and liquidity actions our ability to take certain capital actions, including plans to pay or increase common stock dividends or to repurchase shares under current or future programs, is subject to the results of the supervisory assessment of capital adequacy undertaken by the federal reserve and our primary bank regulators as part of the ccar process.
in connection with the 2014 ccar, pnc submitted its 2014 capital plan, as approved by its board of directors, to the federal reserve in january 2014. as we announced on march 26, 2014, the federal reserve accepted the capital plan and did not object to our proposed capital actions, which included a recommendation to increase the quarterly common stock dividend in the second quarter of 2014. the capital plan also included share repurchase programs of up to $1.5 billion for the four quarter period beginning in the second quarter of 2014 under pncs existing common stock repurchase authorization. these programs include repurchases of up to $200 million to mitigate the financial impact of employee benefit plan transactions. in the last three quarters of 2014, in
34 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k accordance with the 2014 capital plan, we repurchased 12.9 million shares of common stock on the open market, with an average price of $85.95 per share and an aggregate repurchase price of $1.1 billion.
on april 3, 2014, consistent with our 2014 capital plan, our board of directors approved an increase to pncs quarterly common stock dividend from 44 cents per common share to 48 cents per common share beginning with the may 5, 2014 dividend payment.
in connection with the 2015 ccar, pnc submitted its 2015 capital plan, as approved by its board of directors, to the federal reserve in january 2015. pnc expects to receive the federal reserves response (either a non-objection or objection) to the capital plan submitted as part of the 2015 ccar in march 2015. for additional information concerning the ccar process and the factors the federal reserve takes into consideration in evaluating capital plans, see the supervision and regulation section of item 1 of this report.
see the liquidity risk management portion of the risk management section of this item 7 for more detail on our 2014 capital and liquidity actions.

total assets were $345.1 billion at december 31, 2014 compared with $320.2 billion at december 31, 2013. the increase from year end 2013 was primarily due to higher interest-earning deposits with banks and loan growth, partially offset by lower investment securities.
various seasonal and other factors impact our period-end balances, whereas average balances are generally more indicative of underlying business trends apart from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. the consolidated balance sheet review section of this item 7 provides information on changes in selected consolidated balance sheet categories at december 31, 2014 compared with december 31, 2013.
average investment securities decreased during 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to a net decline in average residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities from principal payments, partially offset by an increase in average u.s. treasury and government agencies securities, which was largely driven by purchases to enhance our liquidity position.
total investment securities comprised 20% of average interest-earning assets in 2014 and 22% in 2013.
average loans grew in 2014, driven by increases in average commercial loans of $6.4 billion and average commercial real estate loans of $3.2 billion. the overall increase in loans reflected organic loan growth, primarily in our corporate & institutional banking segment.
loans represented 70% of average interest-earning assets for 2014 and 73% of average interest-earning assets for 2013.
the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k 35
average interest-earning deposits with banks, which are primarily maintained with the federal reserve bank, increased significantly in the comparison to the prior year period as we continued to enhance our liquidity position.
average noninterest-earning assets decreased in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily reflecting lower unsettled securities sales, partially offset by higher investment securities valuation adjustments, both of which are included in noninterest-earning assets for average balance sheet purposes.
average total deposits increased $10.8 billion in 2014 compared with the prior year, driven by an increase of $12.1 billion in average transaction deposits, which grew to $189 billion in 2014. higher average money market deposits, average noninterest-bearing deposits, and average interest-bearing demand deposits drove the increase in both commercial and consumer average transaction deposits. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.6 billion in average retail certificates of deposit attributable to runoff of maturing accounts. total deposits at december 31, 2014 were $232.2 billion compared with $220.9 billion at december 31, 2013 and are further discussed within the consolidated balance sheet review section of this item 7.
average total deposits represented 68% of average total assets for 2014 and 69% for 2013.
average borrowed funds increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to increases in average federal home loan bank (fhlb) borrowings, average bank notes and senior debt, and average subordinated debt, in part to enhance our liquidity position. these increases were partially offset by a decline in average commercial paper. total borrowed funds at december 31, 2014 were $56.8 billion compared with $46.1 billion at december 31, 2013 and are further discussed within the consolidated balance sheet review section of this item 7. the liquidity risk management portion of the risk management section of this item 7 includes additional information regarding our borrowed funds.
business segment highlights total business segment earnings were $3.9 billion in 2014 and $4.0 billion in 2013. the business segments review section of this item 7 includes further analysis of our business segment results during 2014 and 2013, including presentation differences from note 24 segment reporting in our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report. note 24 segment reporting presents results of businesses for 2014, 2013 and 2012.

net income for 2014 of $4.2 billion was stable compared with 2013, as a 4% decrease in revenue was mostly offset by a reduction in provision for credit losses and a 2% decline in noninterest expense. lower revenue in the comparison was driven by a 7% decline in net interest income, as noninterest income was essentially unchanged.

net interest margin            3.08   %            3.57   %
changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. see the statistical information (unaudited)  average consolidated balance sheet and net interest analysis and analysis of year-to-year changes in net interest income in item 8 of this report and the discussion of purchase accounting accretion on purchased impaired loans in the consolidated balance sheet review in this item 7 for additional information.
net interest income decreased by $622 million, or 7%, in 2014 compared with 2013 reflecting the ongoing low rate environment. lower yields on loans and investment securities, a decline in investment securities balances and a reduction in purchase accounting accretion were partially offset by commercial and commercial real estate loan growth. lower net interest income also included the impact from the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees from net interest income to noninterest income.
net interest margin decreased in the comparison to the prior year, driven by a 50 basis point decline in the yield on total interest-earning assets, which included the impact of lower purchase accounting accretion, continued spread compression, and repricing of new and existing loans and securities in the ongoing low rate environment. the decline also included the impact of the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees and the impact of higher interest-earning deposits maintained with the federal reserve bank.
we expect net interest income for the first quarter of 2015 to remain stable with fourth quarter 2014. however, for full year 2015, we expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $225 million compared to 2014.

noninterest income remained relatively stable in 2014 compared to the prior year, as strong overall client fee income was offset by lower residential mortgage revenue, declines in asset valuations and reduced sales of securities. noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 45% for 2014, up from 43% for 2013.
asset management revenue increased in 2014 compared to 2013, driven by increased earnings from our blackrock investment, as well as stronger average equity markets and positive net flows, after adjustments for cyclical client activities. discretionary client assets under management in the asset management group increased to $135 billion at december 31, 2014 compared with $127 billion at december 31, 2013.
consumer service fees were relatively unchanged in 2014 compared to the prior year, as higher consumer service fees in retail banking were offset by lower revenue from previously discontinued insurance programs, as well as the termination of our debit card rewards program in the fourth quarter of 2013, which resulted in a prior year benefit and consequently diluted the year-over-year growth comparison.
corporate service fees increased to $1.4 billion in 2014 compared to $1.2 billion in 2013, driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees from a record year for our mergers and acquisition advisory firm, harris williams, and the impact of the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees from net interest income to noninterest income. these increases were partially offset by lower net commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation gains, which were $38 million in 2014 compared to $68 million in 2013.
the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k 37
residential mortgage revenue decreased to $618 million in 2014 from $871 million in 2013, primarily due to lower loan sales revenue from a reduction in origination volume and significantly lower net hedging gains on residential mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by higher loan servicing fee revenue and the impact of second quarter 2014 gains on sales of previously underperforming portfolio loans.
lower residential mortgage revenue in the comparison also reflected the impact of the 2013 net benefit from release of reserves for residential mortgage repurchase obligations of $53 million, as the impact to 2014 was not significant. this net release of reserves in 2013 was largely the result of agreements with two government-sponsored enterprises (gses), fhlmc and fnma, for loans sold into agency securitizations. see the recourse and repurchase obligations section of this item 7 for further detail.
service charges on deposits increased in 2014, benefitting from changes in product offerings and higher customer-related activity.
other noninterest income decreased to $1.4 billion in 2014 compared to $1.5 billion in 2013. the decline was driven by a reduction in asset valuations, lower revenue associated with private equity investments, decreased revenue due to the lower market value of investments related to deferred compensation obligations, and lower revenue associated with customer-related derivative activities, including credit valuations. these decreases were partially offset by higher gains on sales of other assets.
the decline in revenue from credit valuations for customer-related derivatives activities was driven primarily by market interest rate changes impacting the valuations. the 2013 impact of these customer-related derivatives activities was $56 million, while the 2014 impact was not significant.
higher gains on sales of other assets in the comparison included $94 million on the fourth quarter 2014 sale of pncs washington, d.c. regional headquarters building, as well as increased gains on sales of visa class b common shares, which were $209 million on sales of 3.5 million shares in 2014 compared to $168 million on the sale of 4 million shares in 2013. as of december 31, 2014, we held approximately 7 million visa class b common shares with a fair value of approximately $742 million and a recorded investment of approximately $77 million.
other noninterest income typically fluctuates from period to period depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed. further details regarding our customer-related trading activities are included in the market risk management  customer-related trading risk portion of the risk management section of this item 7. further details regarding private and other equity investments are included in the market risk management  equity and other investment risk section, and further details regarding gains or losses related to our equity investment in blackrock are included in the business segments review section of this item 7.
in the first quarter of 2015, we expect fee income to be down mid-single digits, on a percentage basis, compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 due to seasonality.
for full year 2015, we expect revenue to continue to be under pressure compared with 2014, as we expect the combined revenue growth from our businesses to partially offset the decline in purchase accounting accretion.
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses totaled $273 million in 2014 compared with $643 million in 2013. the decrease in provision reflected improved overall credit quality, including lower consumer loan delinquencies. a contributing economic factor was the increasing value of residential real estate, which improved expected cash flows from our purchased impaired loans.
we currently expect our provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2015 to be between $50 million and $100 million.
the credit risk management portion of the risk management section of this item 7 includes additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses.
noninterest expense noninterest expense was $9.5 billion for 2014, a decrease of $.2 billion, or 2%, from $9.7 billion for 2013, reflecting overall disciplined expense management. the decline was driven by a decrease in personnel expense related to lower headcount and benefits costs, partially offset by investments in technology and infrastructure. additionally, noncash charges of $57 million in 2013 for unamortized discounts related to redemption of trust preferred securities contributed to the decline. see note 14 capital securities of subsidiary trusts and perpetual trust securities in item 8 of our 2013 form 10-k for additional detail on the 2013 redemption of trust preferred securities.
during 2014, we completed actions and exceeded our 2014 continuous improvement goal of $500 million in cost savings. these cost savings are funding investments in our infrastructure, including those related to cybersecurity and our datacenters, and investments in our diversified businesses, including our retail banking transformation, consistent with our strategic priorities.
in 2015, we expect to continue this approach and have a goal of an additional $400 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, which again we expect will help to fund our business and technology investments.
for the first quarter of 2015, we expect noninterest expense to be down by high-single digits on a percentage basis compared with the fourth quarter of 2014.
38 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate was 25.1% for 2014 compared with 25.9% for 2013. the effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits pnc receives from our investments in low income housing and new markets investments, as well as earnings in other tax exempt investments.
the effective tax rates for both 2014 and 2013 reflect the adoption of accounting standards update (asu) 2014-01, which relates to amortization of investments in low income housing tax credits. see the recently adopted accounting standards portion of note 1 accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further detail. the retrospective application of this guidance resulted in increased income tax expenses in both periods due to the reclassification of noninterest expense associated with these investments.

the summarized balance sheet data above is based upon our consolidated balance sheet in item 8 of this report.
the increase in total assets was primarily due to higher interest-earning deposits with banks and loan growth, partially offset by lower investment securities. the increase in interest-earning deposits with banks was driven by higher deposit balances maintained with the federal reserve bank due to regulatory short-term liquidity standards that became effective for pnc as an advanced approaches bank beginning january 1, 2015. interest-earning deposits with banks included balances held with the federal reserve bank of cleveland of $31.4 billion and $11.7 billion at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. the increase in liabilities was largely due to growth in deposits and higher federal home loan bank borrowings and issuances of bank notes and senior debt and subordinated debt, partially offset by a decline in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements. an analysis of changes in selected balance sheet categories follows.

40 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k the increase in loans was driven by the increase in commercial lending as a result of growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans, primarily from new customers and organic growth. the decline in consumer lending resulted from lower home equity, education and residential mortgage loans, partially offset by growth in automobile loans.
loans represented 59% of total assets at december 31, 2014 and 61% at december 31, 2013. commercial lending represented 63% of the loan portfolio at december 31, 2014 and 60% at december 31, 2013. consumer lending represented 37% of the loan portfolio at december 31, 2014 and 40% at december 31, 2013.
commercial real estate loans represented 11% of total loans at both december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 and represented 7% of total assets at both december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013. see the credit risk management portion of the risk management section of this item 7 for additional information regarding our loan portfolio.
total loans above include purchased impaired loans of $4.9 billion, or 2% of total loans, at december 31, 2014, and $6.1 billion, or 3% of total loans, at december 31, 2013.
our loan portfolio continued to be diversified among numerous industries, types of businesses and consumers across our principal geographic markets.
allowance for loan and lease losses (alll)
our total alll of $3.3 billion at december 31, 2014 consisted of $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion established for the commercial lending and consumer lending categories, respectively. the alll included what we believe to be appropriate loss coverage on all loans, including higher risk loans, in the commercial and consumer portfolios. we do not consider government insured or guaranteed loans to be higher risk as defaults have historically been materially mitigated by payments of insurance or guarantee amounts for approved claims. additional information regarding our higher risk loans is included in the credit risk management portion of the risk management section of this item 7 and note 1 accounting policies, note 3 asset quality and note 5 allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.

(a)                approximately 93% and 37% of the net reclassifications for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were driven by the commercial portfolio and were due to improvements of cash expected to be collected on acquired loans in future periods, with the remainder predominantly due to future cash flow changes in the consumer portfolio.

(b)   as of december 31, 2014, we estimate that the reversal of contractual interest on purchased impaired loans will total approximately $.9 billion in future periods.
this will partially offset the total net accretable interest in future interest income of $1.6 billion on purchased impaired loans.

purchased impaired loans  accretable difference sensitivity analysis the following table provides a sensitivity analysis on the total purchased impaired loans portfolio. the analysis reflects hypothetical changes in key drivers for expected cash flows over the life of the loans under declining and improving conditions at a point in time. any unusual significant economic events or changes, as well as other variables not considered below (e.g., natural or widespread disasters), could result in impacts outside of the ranges represented below. additionally, commercial and commercial real estate loan settlements or sales proceeds can vary widely from appraised values due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, special use considerations, liquidity premiums and improvements/deterioration in other income sources.

investment securities the following table presents the distribution of our investment securities portfolio. we have included credit ratings information because the information is an indicator of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate increased or decreased credit risk and could be accompanied by a reduction or increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio. for those securities, where during our quarterly security-level impairment assessments we determined losses represented other-than-temporary impairment (otti), we have recorded cumulative credit losses of $1.2 billion in earnings and accordingly have reduced the amortized cost of our securities. see table 78 in note 6 investment securities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more detail. the majority of these cumulative impairment charges related to non-agency residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities rated bb or lower.

investment securities represented 16% of total assets at december 31, 2014 and 19% at december 31, 2013.
we evaluate our investment securities portfolio in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps to improve our overall positioning. we consider the portfolio to be well-diversified and of high quality. at december 31, 2014, 85% of the securities in the portfolio were rated aaa/aa, with u.s. treasury and government agencies, agency residential mortgage-backed and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities collectively representing 59% of the portfolio.
the investment securities portfolio includes both available for sale and held to maturity securities. securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses, representing the difference between amortized cost and fair value, included in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, on our consolidated balance sheet. securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. as of december 31, 2014, the amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities totaled $43.2 billion and $44.2 billion, respectively, compared to an amortized cost and fair value as of december 31, 2013 of $48.0 billion and $48.6 billion, respectively. the amortized cost and fair value of held to maturity securities were $11.6 billion and $12.0 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2014, compared to $11.7 billion and $11.8 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2013.
the fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. the fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. in addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and vice versa. net unrealized gains in the total investment securities portfolio increased to $1.5 billion at december 31, 2014 from $.7 billion at december 31, 2013 primarily due to the impact of market interest rates and credit spreads. the comparable amounts for the securities available for sale portfolio were $1.1 billion and $.6 billion, respectively.
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities do not impact liquidity. however these gains and losses do affect risk-based capital under the regulatory capital rules that became effective beginning in 2014 for pnc. also, a change in the securities credit ratings could impact the liquidity of the securities and may be indicative of a change in credit quality, which could affect our risk-weighted assets and, therefore, our regulatory capital ratios under the regulatory capital rules in effect starting with 2014. in addition, the amount representing the credit-related portion of otti on available for sale securities would reduce our earnings and regulatory capital ratios.
during the second quarter of 2014, we transferred securities with a fair value of $1.4 billion from available for sale to held to maturity. we changed our intent and committed to hold these high-quality securities to maturity in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on accumulated other comprehensive income and certain capital measures, after taking into consideration market conditions and regulatory capital requirements under basel iii capital standards. see additional discussion of this transfer in note 6 investment securities in our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.
the duration of investment securities was 2.2 years at december 31, 2014. we estimate that, at december 31, 2014, the effective duration of investment securities was 2.2 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 2.1 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. comparable amounts at december 31, 2013 for the effective duration of investment securities were 3.0 years and 2.8 years, respectively.
at least quarterly, we conduct a comprehensive security-level impairment assessment on all securities. for securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether the loss represents otti. for debt securities that we neither intend to sell nor believe we will be required to sell prior to expected recovery, we recognize the credit portion of otti charges in current earnings and include the noncredit portion of otti in net unrealized gains (losses) on otti securities on our consolidated statement of comprehensive income and net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our consolidated balance sheet. in 2014 and 2013 we recognized otti credit losses of $11 million and $16 million, respectively. the credit losses related to residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities collateralized by non-agency residential loans.
if economic conditions, including housing values, were to deteriorate from current levels, and if market volatility and illiquidity were to deteriorate from current levels, or if market interest rates were to increase or credit spreads were to widen appreciably, the valuation of our investment securities portfolio would likely be adversely affected and we could incur additional otti credit losses that would impact our consolidated income statement.

as of september 1, 2014, we have elected to apply the fair value option to commercial mortgage loans held for sale to agencies. this election applies to all new commercial mortgage loans held for sale originated for sale to the agencies effective on or after september 1, 2014. the election of fair value option aligns the accounting for the commercial mortgages with the related commitments to sell the loans.
we sold $3.5 billion of commercial mortgage loans to agencies in 2014 compared to $2.8 billion in 2013. total gains of $80 million were recognized on the valuation and sale of commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, in 2014, and $79 million in 2013. these amounts are included in other noninterest income on our consolidated income statement.
residential mortgage loan origination volume was $9.5 billion in 2014 compared to $15.1 billion in 2013. the majority of such loans were originated under agency or federal housing administration (fha) standards. we sold $8.3 billion of loans and recognized loan sales revenue of $420 million in 2014. the comparable amounts for 2013 were $14.7 billion and $568 million.
interest income on loans held for sale was $99 million in 2014 and $157 million in 2013. these amounts are included in other interest income on our consolidated income statement.

goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $10.9 billion at december 31, 2014 and $11.3 billion at december 31, 2013. the decrease of $.4 billion was primarily due to fair value changes of mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by new additions, including purchases of mortgage servicing rights. see additional information regarding our goodwill and intangible assets in note 8 goodwill and other intangible assets included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.

total deposits increased $11.3 billion at december 31, 2014 compared with december 31, 2013 due to strong growth in demand and money market, partially offset by lower retail certificates of deposit. interest-bearing deposits represented 68% of total deposits at both december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013. total borrowed funds increased $10.7 billion since december 31, 2013 as higher federal home loan bank borrowings and issuances of bank notes and senior debt and subordinated debt were partially offset by a decline in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements.

we manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing debt, equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions, managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.
the increase in total shareholders equity compared to the prior year end reflected an increase in retained earnings, partially offset by share repurchases of $1.2 billion under pncs existing common stock repurchase authorization. the increase in retained earnings was driven by net income of $4.2 billion, reduced by $1.2 billion of common and preferred dividends declared. accumulated other comprehensive income increased slightly as the impact of market interest rates and credit spreads on securities available for sale and derivatives that are part of cash flow hedging strategies were mostly offset by the impact of pension and other postretirement benefit plan adjustments. common shares outstanding were 523 million at december 31, 2014 and 533 million at december 31, 2013.
our current common stock repurchase program authorization permits us to purchase up to 25 million shares of pnc common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. this program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated. the extent and timing of share repurchases under this program will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit ratings, contractual and regulatory limitations, and the results of the supervisory assessment of capital adequacy and capital planning processes undertaken by the federal reserve and our primary bank regulators as part of the ccar process. the federal reserve accepted our 2014 capital plan and did not object to our proposed capital actions. the capital plan included share repurchase programs of up to $1.5 billion for the four quarter period beginning in the second quarter of 2014 under pncs existing common stock repurchase authorization. these programs include repurchases of up to $200 million to mitigate the financial impact of employee benefit plan transactions. under the capital plan authorization, pnc repurchased 2.6 million common shares for $223 million in the second quarter of 2014, 4.2 million common shares for $360 million in the third quarter of 2014 and 6.1 million common shares for $524 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. under the de minimis safe harbor of the federal reserves capital plan rule, pnc may make limited repurchases of common stock or other capital distributions in amounts that exceed the amounts included in its most recently approved capital plan, provided that, among other things, such distributions do not exceed, in the aggregate, 1% of pncs tier 1 capital and the federal reserve does not object to the additional repurchases or distributions. under this de minimis safe harbor, pnc repurchased $50 million of common shares to mitigate the financial impact of employee benefit plan transactions in the first quarter of 2014. see the supervision and regulation section of item 1 business in this report for further information concerning the ccar process and the factors the federal reserve takes into consideration in its evaluation of capital plans and the capital and liquidity actions portion of the executive summary section of this item 7 for the impact of the federal reserves current supervisory assessment of the capital adequacy program.

(k)   for comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches basel iii common equity tier 1 capital ratio is 10.4%. this capital ratio is calculated using common equity tier 1 capital and dividing by estimated basel iii advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.

(l)   for comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches basel iii tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 11.8%. this capital ratio is calculated using tier 1 capital and dividing by estimated basel iii advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.

(m)                                            for comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in standardized approach basel iii total capital risk-based capital ratio is 14.1%. this ratio is calculated using additional tier 2 capital which, under the standardized approach, reflects allowance for loan and lease losses of up to 1.25% of credit risk related risk-weighted assets and dividing by estimated basel iii standardized approach risk-weighted assets.

(n)   leverage ratio is calculated based on tier 1 capital divided by average quarterly adjusted total assets.

the basel ii framework, which was adopted by the basel committee on banking supervision in 2004, seeks to provide more risk-sensitive regulatory capital calculations and promote enhanced risk management practices among large, internationally active banking organizations. the u.s. banking agencies initially adopted rules to implement the basel ii capital framework in 2004. in july 2013, the u.s. banking agencies adopted final rules (referred to as the advanced approaches) that modified the basel ii framework effective january 1, 2014. see the supervision and regulation section in item 1 business and item 1a risk factors in this report. prior to fully implementing the advanced approaches to calculate risk-weighted assets, pnc and pnc bank must successfully complete a parallel run qualification phase. both pnc and pnc bank entered this parallel run phase on january 1, 2013. although the minimum parallel run qualification period is four quarters, the parallel run period for pnc and pnc bank, now in its third year, is consistent with the experience of other u.s. banks that have all had multi-year parallel run periods. after pnc exits parallel run, its regulatory risk-based capital ratio for each measure (e.g., common equity tier 1 ratio) will be the lower of the ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches.
as a result of the staggered effective dates of the final u.s. capital rules issued in july 2013, as well as the fact that pnc remains in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, pncs regulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2014 were based on the definitions of, and deductions from, capital under basel iii (as such definitions and deductions are phased-in for 2014) and basel i risk-weighted assets (subject to certain adjustments as defined by the basel iii rules). we refer to the capital ratios calculated using the basel iii phased-in provisions and applicable risk-weighted assets as the transitional basel iii ratios.
federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest u.s. bank holding companies, including pnc, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest u.s. bank holding companies, including pnc, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. we seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our december 31, 2014 capital levels were aligned with them.
at december 31, 2014, pnc and pnc bank, our domestic bank subsidiary, were both considered well capitalized, based on applicable u.s. regulatory capital ratio requirements. to qualify as well capitalized, pnc and pnc bank were required during 2014 to maintain transitional basel iii capital ratios of at least 6% for tier 1 risk-based and 10% for total risk-based, and pnc bank was required to have a transitional basel iii leverage ratio of at least 5%.
common equity tier 1 capital as defined under the basel iii rules adopted by the u.s. banking agencies differs materially from basel i. for example, under basel iii, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets must be deducted from capital to the extent they individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of the institutions adjusted common equity tier 1 capital. also, basel i regulatory capital excludes accumulated other comprehensive income related to securities currently and previously held as available for sale, as well as pension and other postretirement plans, whereas under basel iii these items are a component of pncs capital. the basel iii final rules also eliminate the tier 1 treatment of trust preferred securities for bank holding companies with $15 billion or more in assets. in 2013, we completed the redemption of several series of trust preferred securities previously assumed through acquisitions. pnc still holds trust preferred securities in one trust, which would not be included within common equity tier 1 capital under the basel iii final rules. see note 12 capital securities of a subsidiary trust and perpetual trust securities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more detail on this trust.
the access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives, the ability to undertake new business initiatives including acquisitions, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares or other capital instruments, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in large part, on a financial institutions capital strength.
we provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on pnc in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 business, item 1a risk factors and note 20 regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
pncs basel i ratios as of december 31, 2013, which were pncs effective regulatory capital ratios as of that date, were 10.5% for tier 1 common capital ratio, 12.4% for tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, 15.8% for total risk-based capital ratio and 11.1% for leverage ratio. our 2013 form 10-k included additional information regarding our basel i capital ratios.
48 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k off-balance sheet arrangements and variable interest entities we engage in a variety of activities that involve unconsolidated entities or that are otherwise not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that are generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. additional information on these types of activities is included in the following sections of this report:
   commitments, including contractual obligations and other commitments, included within the risk management section of this item 7,

   note 2 loan sale and servicing activities and variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report,

   note 12 capital securities of a subsidiary trust and perpetual trust securities in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report, and

   note 22 commitments and guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.

pnc consolidates variable interest entities (vies) when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. the primary beneficiary of a vie is determined to be the party that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the vie; and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the vie.
a summary of vies, including those that we have consolidated and those in which we hold variable interests but have not consolidated into our financial statements, as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 is included in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.
trust preferred securities and reit preferred securities we are subject to certain restrictions, including restrictions on dividend payments, in connection with $206 million in principal amount of an outstanding junior subordinated debenture associated with $200 million of trust preferred securities (both amounts as of december 31, 2014) that were issued by pnc capital trust c, a subsidiary statutory trust. generally, if there is (i) an event of default under the debenture, (ii) pnc elects to defer interest on the debenture, (iii) pnc exercises its right to defer payments on the related trust preferred security issued by the statutory trust, or (iv) there is a default under pncs guarantee of such payment obligations, as specified in the applicable governing documents, then pnc would be subject during the period of such default or deferral to restrictions on dividends and other provisions protecting the status of the debenture holders similar to or in some ways more restrictive than those potentially imposed under the exchange agreement with pnc preferred funding trust ii. see note 12 capital securities of a subsidiary trust and perpetual trust securities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information on contractual limitations on dividend payments resulting from securities issued by pnc preferred funding trust i and pnc preferred funding trust ii and additional discussion of trust preferred securities.

the majority of assets recorded at fair value are included in the securities available for sale portfolio. the majority of level 3 assets represent non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities in the securities available for sale portfolio, equity investments and mortgage servicing rights.
an instruments categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification (transfer) of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels. pncs policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out as of the end of the reporting period. for additional information regarding the transfers of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels, see note 7 fair value in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
business segments review we have six reportable business segments:
   retail banking

   corporate &amp; institutional banking

   asset management group

   residential mortgage banking

   blackrock

   non-strategic assets portfolio

business segment results, including the basis of presentation of inter-segment revenues, and a description of each business are included in note 24 segment reporting included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report. certain amounts included in this business segments review section and the business segment highlights in the executive summary section of this item 7 differ from those amounts shown in note 24, primarily due to the presentation in item 7 of this report of business net interest revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. note 24 presents results of businesses for 2014, 2013 and 2012.

retail banking earned $728 million in 2014 compared with earnings of $550 million in 2013. the increase in earnings was driven by a lower provision for credit losses, and increased noninterest income due to strong fee income growth. these increases in earnings were partially offset by lower net interest income driven by lower yields on loans, interest rate spread compression on the value of deposits, and lower purchase accounting accretion.
retail banking continues to augment and refine its core checking account products to enhance the customer experience and grow value. in 2014, we completed the conversion of consumer and business banking customers from free checking. we also focused on product value for consumers and small businesses and growing customer share of wallet through the sale of liquidity, banking and investment products.
   completed the market rollout of pnc total insightsm, an integrated online banking and investing experience for our customers.

                 offered apple paytm to our customers as a convenient payment option.

   enhanced business banking cash flow insightsm features and customer experience.

   introduced relationship pricing for business banking customers.

retail banking also continued to focus on serving more customers through cost effective channels that meet their evolving preferences for convenience.
   in 2014, approximately 46% of consumer customers used non-teller channels for the majority of their transactions compared with 38% for 2013.

   deposit transactions via atm and mobile channels increased to 35% of total deposit transactions in 2014 compared with 25% for 2013.

   as part of pncs retail branch transformation strategy, we continue to evolve our network. we converted 156 branches to universal branches in
2014; additional branches will be converted in 2015. in 2014, 48 branches were closed or consolidated.

   retail bankings primary geographic footprint extends across 17 states and washington, d.c. our retail branch network covers nearly half the u.s.
population, with 2,697 branches and 8,605 atms.

total revenue declined $51 million to $6.0 billion in 2014. net interest income of $3.9 billion decreased $155 million compared with 2013. the decrease resulted primarily from lower yields on loans, interest rate spread compression on the value of deposits, and lower purchase accounting accretion on loans and deposits.
noninterest income of $2.1 billion increased $104 million, or 5%, compared to 2013. noninterest income included strong customer-related fee income growth primarily resulting from changes in product offerings, increases in customer-initiated transactions, and increased brokerage and merchant processing revenue. gains on sales of visa class b common shares totaled $209 million in 2014 compared to $168 million in 2013; 3.5 million shares were sold in 2014 compared to four million shares in 2013.
52 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k the provision for credit losses was $277 million and net charge-offs were $458 million in 2014 compared with $657 million and $713 million, respectively, for 2013. provision for credit losses decreased due to improved credit metrics. the decrease in the net charge-offs was attributable to the impact of additional consumer charge-offs taken as a result of alignment with interagency guidance in the first quarter of 2013 and improved credit quality during 2014.
noninterest expense of $4.6 billion was $49 million, or 1%, higher than 2013. increases in technology investments, customer transaction-related costs, and non-credit losses were offset by reduced branch network expenses as a result of transaction migration to lower cost digital and atm channels.
growing core checking deposits is key to retail bankings growth and to providing a source of low-cost funding and liquidity to pnc. the deposit product strategy of retail banking is to remain disciplined on pricing, target specific products and markets for growth, and focus on the retention and growth of customer balances. in 2014, average total deposits of $137.2 billion increased $3.0 billion, or 2%, compared with 2013.
                  average transaction deposits grew $4.5 billion, or 4%, and average savings deposit balances grew $1.0 billion, or 9%, over 2013 as a result of organic deposit growth. in 2014, average demand deposits increased $3.1 billion, or 6%, to $56.1 billion and average money market deposits increased $1.5 billion, or 3%, to $50.3 billion.

   total average certificates of deposit decreased $2.5 billion, or 12%, compared to 2013. the decline in average certificates of deposit was due to the expected run-off of maturing accounts.

retail banking continued to focus on a relationship-based lending strategy that targets specific products and markets for growth, small businesses, and auto dealerships. in 2014, average total loans declined $60 million to $66.2 billion as growth in specific products was offset by declines from run-off of non-strategic portions of the portfolios.
   average indirect auto loans increased $1.4 billion, or 18%, compared to 2013. the increase was primarily due to increases in auto sales as well as the expansion of our indirect sales force and product introduction into the southeast market.

   average credit card balances increased $222 million, or 5%, over 2013 as a result of efforts to increase credit card share of wallet through organic growth.

   average auto dealer floor plan loans grew $160 million, or 8%, in 2014, primarily resulting from sales growth and additional dealer relationships.

                                                 average home equity loans decreased $448 million compared to 2013. the decrease in lines of credit of approximately $1.0 billion was partially offset by an increase of approximately $600 million in term loans. the overall portfolio declines resulted from reduced refinance activity. retail bankings home equity loan portfolio is relationship based, with 97% of the portfolio attributable to borrowers in our primary geographic footprint.

                                              average loan balances for the remainder of the portfolio declined a net $1.4 billion, driven by declines in the education portfolio of $715 million and commercial &amp; commercial real estate of $399 million. the discontinued government guaranteed education loan, indirect other and residential mortgage portfolios are primarily run-off portfolios. in december 2014 we sold $148 million of education loans. the impacts of the sale to 2014 average loans and earnings were not significant.

nonperforming assets totaled $1.2 billion at december 31, 2014, a decrease of $87 million, or 7%, over 2013. the decrease was driven by declines in both commercial and consumer non-performing loans.

corporate & institutional banking earned $2.1 billion in 2014, a decrease of $158 million compared with 2013. the decrease in earnings was due to narrower spreads on loans and deposits, lower purchase accounting accretion, an increase in the provision for credit losses, and decreases in asset valuations, partially offset by the impact of higher average loans and deposits. we continue to focus on building client relationships where the risk-return profile is attractive, including the southeast.
net interest income was $3.7 billion in 2014, a decrease of $71 million from 2013 primarily due to continued spread compression on loans and deposits, lower purchase accounting accretion and the impact from the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility usage fees from net interest income to corporate service fees, partially offset by the impact of higher average loans and deposits.
corporate service fees were $1.3 billion in 2014, increasing $198 million compared to 2013. this increase was primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and the impact of the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees from net interest income to corporate service fees, partially offset by a lower commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge.
54 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k other noninterest income was $448 million in 2014 compared with $605 million in 2013. the decrease of $157 million was driven by lower revenue associated with credit valuations for customer-related derivatives activities, lower gains on asset sales and lower derivatives sales.
the provision for credit losses was $107 million in 2014 compared with a benefit of $25 million in 2013 reflecting portfolio growth over recent quarters paired with the slowing of the reserve releases related to credit quality improvement. net charge-offs were $8 million in 2014, which represents a decrease of $97 million compared with 2013 primarily attributable to a decrease in commercial and commercial real estate charge-offs.
nonperforming assets were $557 million, a 31% decrease from december 31, 2013 resulting from continued improving credit quality.
noninterest expense was $2.1 billion in 2014, an increase of $65 million primarily driven by higher incentive compensation costs associated with business activity.
average loans were $107.9 billion in 2014 compared with $97.5 billion in 2013, an increase of 11% reflecting strong growth in corporate banking, real estate, business credit and equipment finance:
                                  corporate banking business provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to mid-sized and large corporations, government and not-for-profit entities. average loans for this business increased $3.7 billion, or 7%, in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to an increase in loan commitments from specialty lending businesses.

   pnc real estate provides commercial real estate and real estate-related lending through both conventional and affordable multifamily financing. average loans for this business increased $5.5 billion, or 24%, in 2014 compared with 2013 due to increased originations.

   pnc business credit provides asset-based lending. the loan portfolio is relatively high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured by short-term assets. average loans increased $1.6 billion, or 14%, in 2014 compared with 2013 due to increasing deal sizes and higher utilization.

   pnc equipment finance provides equipment financing solutions with $11.9 billion in equipment finance assets as of december 31, 2014. average equipment finance assets in 2014 were $11.2 billion, an increase of $.6 billion or 5% compared with 2013.

loan commitments increased 8%, or $16.2 billion, to $212.3 billion at december 31, 2014 compared to $196.1 billion at december 31, 2013, primarily due to growth in our real estate, corporate banking and business credit businesses.
period-end loan balances increased by 12%, or $12.2 billion, to $113.9 billion at december 31, 2014 compared with $101.8 billion at december 31, 2013.
average deposits were $73.5 billion in 2014, an increase of $6.7 billion, or 10%, compared with 2013 as a result of business growth and inflows into money market and noninterest-bearing deposits.
the commercial mortgage servicing portfolio was $336 billion at december 31, 2014, an increase of 9% compared with december 31, 2013 as servicing additions exceeded portfolio run-off.
product revenue in addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, corporate & institutional banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of other business segments. on a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income, corporate service fees and other noninterest income. from a segment perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the corporate & institutional banking segment results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. the other information section in table 21 in the corporate & institutional banking portion of this business segments review section includes the consolidated revenue to pnc for these services. a discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.
treasury management revenue, comprised of fees and net interest income from customer deposit balances, totaled $1.3 billion in 2014 compared with $1.3 billion in 2013. higher average deposit balances were offset by lower spreads on deposits.
capital markets revenue includes merger and acquisition advisory fees, loan syndications, derivatives, foreign exchange, asset-backed finance revenue, fixed income and equity capital markets advisory activities. revenue from capital markets-related products and services totaled $777 million in 2014 compared with $722 million in 2013. the increase in the comparison was driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and to a lesser extent higher loan syndications and foreign exchange revenue, which was partially offset by lower revenue associated with credit valuations for customer-related derivatives activities and related derivatives sales.
commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (including net interest income and noninterest income) and revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges. total commercial mortgage banking activities resulted in revenue of $386 million in 2014 compared with $427 million in 2013. the decrease in the comparison was mainly due to lower net commercial mortgage servicing rights valuations.

56 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k asset management group earned $181 million in 2014 compared with $162 million in 2013. client assets under administration were $263 billion as of december 31, 2014 compared to $247 billion as of december 31, 2013. earnings increased due to higher noninterest income from higher assets, partially offset by higher noninterest expense from strategic growth.
the core growth strategies of the business include increasing sales sourced from other pnc lines of business, maximizing front line productivity and optimizing market presence including additions to staff in high opportunity markets. wealth management and hawthorn have over 100 offices operating in 7 out of the 10 most affluent states in the u.s. with a majority co-located with retail banking branches. the businesses strategies primarily focus on growing client assets under management through expanding relationships directly and through cross-selling from pncs other lines of business.
institutional asset management provides advisory, custody, and retirement administration services to institutional clients primarily within our banking footprint. the business also offers pnc proprietary mutual funds. institutional asset management is strengthening its partnership with the corporate bank to drive growth and is focused on building retirement capabilities and expanding product solutions for all customers.
client assets under administration of $263 billion increased $16 billion compared to a year ago. discretionary client assets under management were $135 billion at december 31, 2014 increased $8 billion compared with december 31, 2013. the increase was driven by higher equity markets, new sales, and positive net flows, after adjustments for cyclical client activities.
total revenue for 2014 increased $67 million to $1.1 billion compared with $1.0 billion for 2013, primarily relating to noninterest income due to stronger average equity markets and positive net flows, after adjustments for cyclical client activities.
noninterest expense was $821 million in 2014, an increase of $47 million, or 6%, from the prior year. the increase was primarily attributable to compensation expense from increases in headcount and investments in technology. over the last 12 months, total full-time headcount has increased by approximately 43 positions, or 1%. asset management group remains focused on disciplined expense management as it invests in strategic growth opportunities.
average deposits for 2014 increased $.7 billion, or 8%, from the prior year. average transaction deposits grew 8% to $9.3 billion compared with 2013 and were partially offset by the run-off of maturing certificates of deposit. average loan balances of $7.3 billion increased $.4 billion, or 6%, from the prior year due to continued growth in the consumer loan portfolio.

58 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k residential mortgage banking earned $35 million in 2014 compared with $148 million in 2013. earnings declined from the prior year primarily as a result of decreased loan sales revenue and lower net hedging gains on residential mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by increased servicing fees and lower origination and servicing expenses.
the strategic focus of the business is the acquisition of new customers through a retail loan officer sales force with an emphasis on home purchase transactions. our strategy involves competing on the basis of superior service to new and existing customers in serving their home purchase and refinancing needs. a key consideration in pursuing this approach is the cross-sell opportunity, especially in the bank footprint markets.
residential mortgage banking overview:
                                                       total loan originations were $9.5 billion for 2014 compared with $15.1 billion for 2013. loans continue to be originated primarily through direct channels under federal national mortgage association (fnma), federal home loan mortgage corporation (fhlmc) and federal housing administration (fha)/department of veterans affairs agency guidelines. refinancings were 55% of originations for 2014 and
70% in 2013. during 2014, 21% of loan originations were under the original or revised home affordable refinance program (harp or harp 2).

                                                investors having purchased mortgage loans may request pnc to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans that they believe do not comply with applicable contractual loan origination covenants and representations and warranties we have made. at december 31, 2014, the liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for the residential mortgage banking business segment was $107 million compared with $131 million at december 31, 2013. see the recourse and repurchase obligations section of this item 7 and note 22 commitments and guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item 8 of this report for additional information.

   residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $108 billion at december 31, 2014 and $114 billion at december 31, 2013 as payoffs continued to outpace new direct loan origination volume and acquisitions.

                              noninterest income was $651 million in 2014 compared with $906 million in 2013. decreased loan sales revenue and lower net hedging gains on residential mortgage servicing rights were partially offset by increased servicing fees. in addition, the comparison was impacted by a residential mortgage repurchase obligation benefit of $53 million recorded in 2013.

   provision for credit losses in 2014 was a $2 million benefit, compared with an expense of $21 million in 2013.

   net interest income was $149 million in 2014 compared with $194 million in 2013. the decrease in net interest income was primarily due to the decline in origination volume.

   noninterest expense was $746 million in 2014 compared with $845 million in 2013. lower origination and servicing costs, as well as lower residential mortgage foreclosure-related costs, drove the decline in expenses.

(d)   recorded investment of purchased impaired loans related to acquisitions. at december 31, 2014, this segment contained 80% of pncs purchased impaired loans.

this business segment consists of non-strategic assets primarily obtained through acquisitions of other companies. the business activity of this segment is to manage the wind-down of the portfolios while maximizing the value and mitigating risk.
non-strategic assets portfolio had earnings of $367 million in 2014 compared with $379 million in 2013. earnings decreased year-over-year due to lower income driven by a smaller portfolio partially offset by an increased benefit from the provision for credit losses, driven by improved economic conditions and, lower non-interest expense.
non-strategic assets portfolio overview:
   net interest income was $547 million in 2014 compared with $689 million in 2013. the decrease was driven by lower purchase accounting accretion and interest earned on a declining average loan portfolio.

   noninterest income was $40 million in 2014 compared with $53 million in 2013. the decrease was driven by lower loss reimbursements on insured loans and higher provision for estimated losses on repurchase obligations on home equity loans and lines.

                              the 2014 period reflected a benefit from the provision for credit losses of $119 million compared to a benefit of $21 million in 2013. the decline in provision reflected overall improvement in credit quality. a contributing economic factor was the increasing value of residential real estate that improved expected cash flows on purchased impaired loans.

   noninterest expense in 2014 was $125 million compared with $163 million in 2013. a smaller portfolio and improving market conditions drove lower cost on nonaccrual residential mortgages and lower commercial oreo expense.

   average portfolio loans declined to $9.1 billion in 2014 compared with $10.7 billion in 2013. the overall decline was driven by customer payment activity and portfolio management activities to reduce under-performing assets.

60 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. note 1 accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.
fair value measurements we must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value.
assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by independent third-party sources, including appraisers and valuation specialists, when available. when such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.
pnc applies asc 820  fair value measurements. this guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. this guidance requires a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. the classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used in the measurement are observable or unobservable.
the following sections of this report provide further information on this type of activity:
   fair value measurements included within this item 7, and

   note 7 fair value included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.

allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we maintain the alll and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at levels that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolios and on these unfunded credit facilities as of the balance sheet date. our determination of the allowances is based on periodic evaluations of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities and other relevant factors. these critical estimates include significant use of pncs own historical data and complex methods to interpret them. we have an ongoing process to evaluate and enhance the quality, quantity and timeliness of our data and interpretation methods used in the determination of these allowances. these evaluations are inherently subjective, as they require material estimates and may be susceptible to significant change, and include, among others:
   probability of default (pd),

   loss given default (lgd),

   outstanding balance of the loan,

   movement through delinquency stages,

   amounts and timing of expected future cash flows,

   value of collateral, which may be obtained from third parties, and

   qualitative factors, such as changes in current economic conditions, that may not be reflected in modeled results.

for all loans, the alll is the sum of three components: (i) asset specific/individual impaired reserves, (ii) quantitative (formulaic or pooled) reserves and (iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. the reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. for unfunded commitments, the reserve estimate also includes estimation of the probability of funding. key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.
to the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce future earnings. see the following for additional information:
   allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the credit risk management section of this item 7, and

              note 1 accounting policies and note 5 allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements and allocation of allowance for loan and lease losses in the statistical information (unaudited) section of item 8 of this report.

estimated cash flows on purchased impaired loans asc 310-30  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality (formerly sop 03-3) provides the gaap guidance for the accounting for purchased impaired loans. these loans have experienced a deterioration of credit quality from origination to acquisition for which it is probable that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable, including both principal and interest.
in our assessment of credit quality deterioration, we must make numerous assumptions, interpretations and judgments, using internal and third-party credit quality information to determine whether it is probable that we will be able to collect all contractually required payments. this point in time assessment is inherently subjective due to the nature of the available information and judgment involved.
those loans that qualify under asc 310-30 are recorded at fair value at acquisition, which involves estimating the expected cash flows to be received. measurement of the fair value of the loan is based on the provisions of asc 820. asc 310-30 prohibits the carryover or establishment of an allowance for loan losses on the acquisition date.
subsequent to the acquisition of the loan, we are required to continue to estimate cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loan (or pool of loans). the measurement of expected cash flows involves assumptions and judgments as to credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds and collateral values. all of these factors are inherently subjective and can result in significant changes in the cash flow estimates over the life of the loan. such changes in expected cash flows could increase future earnings volatility.
see note 1 accounting policies, note 4 purchased loans, and note 5 allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information.
goodwill goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. most of our goodwill relates to value inherent in the retail banking and corporate & institutional banking businesses. the value of this goodwill is dependent upon our ability to provide quality, cost-effective services in the face of competition from other market participants on a national and, with respect to some products and services, an international basis. we also rely upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value-added service features, and the ease of access by customers to our services.
as such, the value of goodwill is supported by earnings, which is driven by transaction volume and, for certain businesses, the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided. lower earnings resulting from a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, which could result in a current period charge to earnings. at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances have changed significantly from the annual test date, management reviews the current operating environment and strategic direction of each reporting unit taking into consideration any events or changes in circumstances that may have an effect on the unit. for this review, inputs are generated and used in calculating the fair value of the reporting unit, which is compared to its carrying amount (step 1 of the goodwill impairment test) as further discussed below. the fair values of the majority of our reporting units are determined using a discounted cash flow valuation model with assumptions based upon market comparables. additionally, we may also evaluate certain financial metrics that are indicative of fair value, including market quotes, price to earnings ratios and recent acquisitions involving other financial institutions. a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the reporting unit is not considered impaired. however, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the reporting units goodwill would be evaluated for impairment. in this circumstance, the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill would be compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill (step 2 of the goodwill impairment test). if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss. the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill is determined by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to its assets and liabilities (including any unrecognized intangible assets) with the residual amount equal to the implied fair value of goodwill as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.
a reporting units carrying amount is based upon assigned economic capital as determined by pncs internal management methodologies. additionally, in performing step 1 of our goodwill impairment testing, we utilize three equity metrics:
   assigned reporting unit economic capital as determined by our internal management methodologies, inclusive of goodwill.

   a 7% fully phased-in basel iii common equity tier 1 capital ratio for the reporting unit consistent with pncs risk framework guidelines.

   the capital levels for comparable companies (as reported in comparable company public financial statements), adjusted for differences in risk characteristics between the comparable companies and the reporting unit.

62 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k in determining a reporting units fair value and comparing it to its carrying value, we generally utilize the highest of these three amounts (the targeted equity) in our discounted cash flow methodology. under this methodology, if necessary, we will infuse capital to achieve the targeted equity amount. as of october 1, 2014 (annual impairment testing date), unallocated excess capital (difference between shareholders equity minus total economic capital assigned and increased by the incremental targeted equity capital infusion) represented capital reserved for potential future capital needs.
the results of our annual 2014 impairment test indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least 10% and are not considered to be at risk of not passing step 1. by definition, assumptions utilized in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain, but absent a significant change in economic conditions of a reporting unit, we would not expect the fair values of these reporting units to decrease below their respective carrying values. similarly, there were no impairment charges related to goodwill in 2013.
during 2012, our residential mortgage banking business, similar to other residential mortgage banking businesses, experienced higher operating costs and increased uncertainties such as elevated indemnification and repurchase liabilities and foreclosure related issues. as a result of our annual impairment test, we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the residential mortgage banking reporting unit was impaired. we recorded an impairment charge of $45 million within noninterest expense which reduced the carrying value of goodwill attributed to residential mortgage banking to zero.
see note 8 goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information.
lease residuals we provide financing for various types of equipment, including aircraft, energy and power systems, and vehicles through a variety of lease arrangements. direct financing leases are carried at the sum of lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors. residual values are derived from historical remarketing experience, secondary market contacts, and industry publications. to the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third-party, we bear the risk of ownership of the leased assets. this includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the estimated residual value, which could result in an impairment charge and reduce earnings in the future. residual values are reviewed for impairment at least annually.
revenue recognition we earn net interest and noninterest income from various sources, including:
   lending,

   securities portfolio,

   asset management,

   customer deposits,

   loan sales and servicing,

   brokerage services,

   sale of loans and securities,

   certain private equity activities, and

   securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities.

we also earn fees and commissions from issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, selling various insurance products, providing treasury management services, providing merger and acquisition advisory and related services, and participating in certain capital markets transactions. revenue earned on interest-earning assets, including the accretion of discounts recognized on acquired or purchased loans recorded at fair value, is recognized based on the constant effective yield of the financial instrument or based on other applicable accounting guidance.
the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent on estimates, judgments, assumptions, and interpretation of contractual terms. changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products, market conditions or industry norms.
residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights we elect to measure our residential mortgage servicing rights (msrs) at fair value. this election was made to be consistent with our risk management strategy to hedge changes in the fair value of these assets as described below. the fair value of residential msrs is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other economic factors which are determined based on current market conditions.
as of january 1, 2014, pnc made an irrevocable election to subsequently measure all classes of commercial msrs at fair value in order to eliminate any potential measurement mismatch between our economic hedges and the commercial msrs. the impact of this election was not material. the fair value of commercial msrs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow model incorporating inputs for assumptions as to constant prepayment rates, discount rates and other factors determined based on current market conditions and the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k 63
expectations. we recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of commercial msrs as a result of that election. commercial msrs are subject to declines in value from actual or expected prepayment of the underlying loans and also from defaults. we manage this risk by economically hedging the fair value of commercial msrs with securities and derivatives instruments which are expected to increase (or decrease) in value when the value of commercial msrs declines (or increases). prior to 2014, commercial msrs were initially recorded at fair value and subsequently accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. commercial msrs were periodically evaluated for impairment. for purposes of impairment, the commercial msrs were stratified based on asset type, which characterizes the predominant risk of the underlying financial asset.
pnc employs risk management strategies designed to protect the value of msrs from changes in interest rates and related market factors. the values of the residential msrs are economically hedged with securities and derivatives, including interest-rate swaps, options, and forward mortgage-backed and futures contracts. as interest rates change, these financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the hedged residential msrs portfolio. the hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the residential msrs. commercial msrs are economically hedged at a macro level or with specific derivatives and securities to protect against a significant decline in interest rates. selecting appropriate financial instruments to economically hedge residential or commercial msrs requires significant management judgment to assess how mortgage rates and prepayment speeds could affect the future values of msrs. hedging results can frequently be less predictable in the short term, but over longer periods of time are expected to protect the economic value of the msrs.

income taxes in the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries enter into transactions for which the tax treatment is unclear or subject to varying interpretations. in addition, filing requirements, methods of filing and the calculation of taxable income in various state and local jurisdictions are subject to differing interpretations.
we evaluate and assess the relative risks and merits of the tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, filing methods and taxable income calculations after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other information, and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation of these relative risks and merits. the result of our evaluation and assessment is by its nature an estimate. we and our subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from taxing authorities. in the event we resolve a challenge for an amount different than amounts previously accrued, we will account for the difference in the period in which we resolve the matter.
recently issued accounting standards in january 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) 2014-04, receivables  troubled debt restructurings by creditors (subtopic 310-40): reclassification of residential real estate collateralized consumer mortgage loans upon foreclosure. this asu clarifies that an in substance repossession or foreclosure is considered to have occurred, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon a) the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or b) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy the loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. we adopted this guidance as of january 1, 2015. adoption of this asu did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606). this asu clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and replaces nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance in u.s. gaap with one accounting model. the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the satisfaction of a performance obligation by transfer of promised goods or services to customers. the asu also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. the asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. early application is not permitted. the requirements within the asu should be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented (with several practical expedients for certain completed contracts) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the asu recognized at the date of initial application. we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our results of operations and financial position.
in june 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-11, transfers and servicing (topic 860): repurchase-to-maturity transactions, repurchase financings, and disclosures. this asu changes

in august 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-14, receivables  troubled debt restructurings by creditors (subtopic 310-40): classification of certain government-guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure (a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force). this asu requires that a mortgage loan be derecognized and that a separate other receivable be recognized upon foreclosure when a) the loan has a government guarantee that is not separable from the loan before foreclosure; b) the creditor has the intent to convey the real estate to the guarantor and make a claim on the guarantee and the creditor has the ability to recover under that claim at the time of foreclosure; and c) any amount of the claim that is determined upon the basis of the real estate is fixed at the time of foreclosure. the receivable should be measured based on the loan balance (inclusive of principal and interest) that is expected to be recovered from the guarantor. this asu is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after december 15, 2014. the asu may be adopted using either a prospective or modified retrospective transition method consistent with the method elected to adopt asu 2014-04, receivables  troubled debt restructurings by creditors (subtopic 310-40): reclassification of residential real estate collateralized consumer mortgage loans upon foreclosure. we adopted this guidance as of january 1, 2015. adoption of this asu did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
in november 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-16, derivatives and hedging (topic 815): determining whether the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or to equity (a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force). this asu clarifies that an entity should consider all relevant terms and features, inclusive of the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcation, when evaluating whether the nature of the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share, is debt-like or equity-like. when making this determination, the asu also clarifies that the substance of the economic characteristics of the relevant terms and features, and circumstances under which the instrument was issued should be considered. the asu is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after december 15, 2015 and should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as of the beginning of the period of adoption. retrospective application is permitted to all relevant prior periods. we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our results of operations and financial position.
recently adopted accounting pronouncements see note 1 accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report regarding the impact of new accounting pronouncements which we have adopted.
status of qualified defined benefit pension plan we have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan (plan or pension plan) covering eligible employees. benefits are determined using a cash balance formula where earnings credits are applied as a percentage of eligible compensation. pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. consistent with our investment strategy, plan assets are primarily invested in equity investments and fixed income instruments. plan fiduciaries determine and review the plans investment policy, which is described more fully in note 13 employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
we calculate the expense associated with the pension plan and the assumptions and methods that we use include a policy of reflecting plan assets at their fair market value. on an annual basis, we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan. the primary assumptions used to measure pension obligations and costs are the discount rate, mortality, compensation increase and expected long-term return on plan assets. among these, the compensation increase assumption does not significantly affect pension expense.
asc 715-30 and asc 715-60 stipulate that each individual assumption, including mortality, should reflect the plan sponsors best estimate. pnc has historically utilized a version of the society of actuaries (soa) published mortality tables in developing its best estimate of mortality. on october 27, 2014, the soa published a new study on mortality rates that included updated mortality tables and mortality improvement scale, which both reflect longer life expectancy. based on an evaluation of the mortality experience of pncs qualified pension plan participants in conjunction with the updated soa mortality study, pnc adopted an adjusted version of the soas new mortality table and improvement scale for purposes of measuring the plans benefit obligations at december 31, 2014. this change to the mortality assumption increased the qualified pension plans benefit obligations by approximately $115 million at december 31, 2014.
the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k 65
the discount rate used to measure pension obligations is determined by comparing the expected future benefits that will be paid under the plan with yields available on high quality corporate bonds of similar duration. the impact on pension expense of a .5% decrease in discount rate in the current environment is an increase of $18 million per year. this sensitivity depends on the economic environment and amount of unrecognized actuarial gains or losses on the measurement date.
the expected long-term return on assets assumption also has a significant effect on pension expense. the expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the pension plan and the asset allocation policy currently in place. for purposes of setting and reviewing this assumption, long term refers to the period over which the plans projected benefit obligations will be disbursed. we review this assumption at each measurement date and adjust it if warranted. our selection process references certain historical data and the current environment, but primarily utilizes qualitative judgment regarding future return expectations.
to evaluate the continued reasonableness of our assumption, we examine a variety of viewpoints and data. various studies have shown that portfolios comprised primarily of u.s. equity securities have historically returned approximately 9% annually over long periods of time, while u.s. debt securities have returned approximately 6% annually over long periods. application of these historical returns to the plans allocation ranges for equities and bonds produces a result between 6.50% and 7.25% and is one point of reference, among many other factors, that is taken into consideration. we also examine the plans actual historical returns over various periods and consider the current economic environment. recent experience is considered in our evaluation with appropriate consideration that, especially for short time periods, recent returns are not reliable indicators of future returns. while annual returns can vary significantly (actual returns for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were +6.50%, +15.48%, and +15.29%, respectively), the selected assumption represents our estimated long-term average prospective returns.
acknowledging the potentially wide range for this assumption, we also annually examine the assumption used by other companies with similar pension investment strategies, so that we can ascertain whether our determinations markedly differ from others. in all cases, however, this data simply informs our process, which places the greatest emphasis on our qualitative judgment of future investment returns, given the conditions existing at each annual measurement date.
taking into consideration all of these factors, the expected long-term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension cost for 2014 was 7.00%, down from 7.50% for 2013. after considering the views of both internal and external capital market advisors, particularly with regard to the effects of the recent economic environment on long-term prospective fixed income returns, we are reducing our expected long-term return on assets to 6.75% for determining pension cost for 2015.
under current accounting rules, the difference between expected long-term returns and actual returns is accumulated and amortized to pension expense over future periods. each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return can cause expense in subsequent years to increase or decrease by up to $9 million as the impact is amortized into results of operations.
we currently estimate pretax pension expense of $9 million in 2015 compared with pretax income of $7 million in 2014. this year-over-year expected increase in expense reflects the effects of the lower expected return on asset assumption, improved mortality, and the lower discount rate required to be used in 2015. these factors will be partially offset by the favorable impact of the increase in plan assets at december 31, 2014 and the assumed return on a $200 million voluntary contribution to the plan made in february 2015.
the table below reflects the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in annual assumptions, using 2015 estimated expense as a baseline.
table 26: pension expense  sensitivity analysis change in assumption (a)                                              estimated increase/(decrease)

.5% increase in compensation rate                                            $2
(a)   the impact is the effect of changing the specified assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.

our pension plan contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions. investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements and will drive the amount of required contributions in future years. also, current law, including the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006, sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan. notwithstanding the voluntary contribution made in february 2015 noted above, we do not expect to be required to make any contributions to the plan during 2015.
we maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results, including various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees, which are described more fully in note 13 employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
66 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k recourse and repurchase obligations as discussed in note 2 loan sale and servicing activities and variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, pnc has sold commercial mortgage, residential mortgage and home equity loans directly or indirectly through securitization and loan sale transactions in which we have continuing involvement. one form of continuing involvement includes certain recourse and loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets.
commercial mortgage loan recourse obligations we originate, close and service certain multi-family commercial mortgage loans which are sold to fnma under fnmas delegated underwriting and servicing (dus) program. we participated in a similar program with the fhlmc. our exposure and activity associated with these recourse obligations are reported in the corporate & institutional banking segment. for more information regarding our commercial mortgage loan recourse obligations, see the recourse and repurchase obligations section of note 22 commitments and guarantees included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
residential mortgage and home equity repurchase obligations as a result of alleged breaches of loan covenants and representations and warranties, investors may request pnc to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans. indemnification and repurchase claims are often settled on an individual basis through make whole payments or loan repurchases, although we may also negotiate pooled settlements with investors. in connection with pooled settlements, we typically do not repurchase loans and the consummation of such transactions generally results in us no longer having indemnification and repurchase exposure with the investor in the transaction.
residential mortgage repurchase obligations while residential mortgage loans are sold on a non-recourse basis, we assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with mortgage loans we have sold to investors. these loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where pnc is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements. residential mortgage loans covered by these loan repurchase obligations include first and second-lien mortgage loans we have sold through agency securitizations, non-agency securitizations, and loan sale transactions. as discussed in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, agency securitizations consist of mortgage loan sale transactions with fnma, fhlmc and the government national mortgage association (gnma), while non-agency securitizations consist of mortgage loan sale transactions with private investors. mortgage loan sale transactions that are not part of a securitization may involve fnma, fhlmc or private investors. our historical exposure and activity associated with agency securitization repurchase obligations has primarily been related to transactions with fnma and fhlmc, as indemnification and repurchase losses associated with fha and va-insured and uninsured loans pooled in gnma securitizations historically have been minimal. in addition to indemnification and repurchase risk, we face other risks of loss with respect to our participation in these programs, some of which are described in note 21 legal proceedings in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report with respect to governmental inquiries related to fha-insured loans. repurchase obligation activity associated with residential mortgages is reported in the residential mortgage banking segment.
origination and sale of residential mortgages is an ongoing business activity and, accordingly, management continually assesses the need to recognize indemnification and repurchase liabilities pursuant to the associated investor sale agreements. we establish indemnification and repurchase liabilities for estimated losses on sold first and second-lien mortgages for which indemnification is expected to be provided or for loans that are expected to be repurchased. for the first and second-lien mortgage sold portfolio, we have established an indemnification and repurchase liability pursuant to investor sale agreements based on claims made and our estimate of future claims on a loan by loan basis. to estimate the mortgage repurchase liability arising from breaches of representations and warranties, we consider the following factors: (i) borrower performance in our historically sold portfolio (both actual and estimated future defaults); (ii) the level of outstanding unresolved repurchase claims; (iii) estimated probable future repurchase claims, considering information about expected investor behaviors, delinquent and liquidated loans, resolved and unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notices and our historical experience with claim rescissions; (iv) the potential ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase claims (rescission rate) and (v) the estimated severity of loss upon repurchase of the loan or collateral, make-whole settlement or indemnification.

residential mortgages that we service through fnma, fhlmc and gnma securitizations, and for which we could experience a loss if required to repurchase a delinquent loan due to a breach in representations or warranties, were $49 billion at december 31, 2014, of which $251 million was 90 days or more delinquent. these amounts were $48 billion and $253 million, respectively, at december 31, 2013.
in the fourth quarter of 2013, pnc reached agreements with both fnma and fhlmc to resolve their repurchase claims with respect to loans sold between 2000 and 2008. pnc paid a total of $191 million related to these settlements. the volume of new repurchase demand claims dropped significantly in 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 as a result of the settlement
68 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k agreements in the fourth quarter of 2013. additionally, the liability for estimated losses on indemnification and repurchase claims for residential mortgages decreased to $107 million at december 31, 2014 from $131 million at december 31, 2013.
we believe our indemnification and repurchase liability appropriately reflects the estimated probable losses on indemnification and repurchase claims for all residential mortgage loans sold and outstanding as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013. in making these estimates, we consider the losses that we expect to incur over the life of the sold loans. see note 22 commitments and guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information.
home equity repurchase obligations pncs repurchase obligations include obligations with respect to certain brokered home equity loans/lines of credit that were sold to a limited number of private investors in the financial services industry by national city prior to our acquisition of national city. pnc is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business, and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of the loans sold in these transactions. repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity loans/lines of credit is reported in the non-strategic assets portfolio segment.
loan covenants and representations and warranties were established through loan sale agreements with various investors to provide assurance that loans pnc sold to the investors were of sufficient investment quality. key aspects of such covenants and representations and warranties include the loans compliance with any applicable loan criteria established for the transaction, including underwriting standards, delivery of all required loan documents to the investor or its designated party, sufficient collateral valuation, and the validity of the lien securing the loan. as a result of alleged breaches of these contractual obligations, investors may request pnc to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans.
investor indemnification or repurchase claims are typically settled on an individual loan basis through make-whole payments or loan repurchases; however, on occasion we may negotiate pooled settlements with investors. in connection with pooled settlements, we typically do not repurchase loans and the consummation of such transactions generally results in us no longer having indemnification and repurchase exposure with the investor in the transaction.
an indemnification and repurchase liability for estimated losses for which indemnification is expected to be provided or for loans that are expected to be repurchased was established at the acquisition of national city. managements evaluation of these indemnification and repurchase liabilities is based upon trends in indemnification and repurchase claims, actual loss experience, risks in the underlying serviced loan portfolios, current economic conditions and the periodic negotiations that management may enter into with investors to settle existing and potential future claims.
indemnification and repurchase liabilities, which are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, are evaluated by management on a quarterly basis. initial recognition and subsequent adjustments to the indemnification are recognized in other noninterest income on the consolidated income statement. for more information regarding our home equity repurchase obligations, see note 22 commitments and guarantees in the notes to consolidated statements in item 8 of this report.
risk management enterprise risk management pnc encounters risk as part of the normal course of operating our business. accordingly, we design risk management processes to help manage this risk. we take risks we understand in order to optimize long term shareholder value.
this risk management section describes our risk framework, including risk appetite and strategy, culture, governance, risk identification, controls and reporting. the overall risk management section of this item 7 also provides an analysis of our key areas of risk, which include but are not limited to credit, operational, compliance, market, liquidity and model. our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the risk management section.
pnc operates within a rapidly evolving regulatory environment. accordingly, we are actively focused on the timely adoption of regulatory pronouncements within our enterprise risk management (erm) framework.
we view risk management as a cohesive combination of the following risk elements which form pncs erm framework:
the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k 69
risk appetite and strategy pnc manages risk in light of our risk appetite to optimize long term shareholder value while supporting our employees, customers, and communities. pncs risk appetite represents the organizations desired enterprise risk position, set within our capital-based risk and liquidity capacity to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans. reviewed periodically through the risk reporting and strategic planning processes, the risk appetite serves as an operating guide for making balanced risk decisions that support our business strategies; it will adjust over time to reflect the current and anticipated economic environment, growth objectives, risk capacity and our risk profile.
we establish guiding principles for each of the risks within our taxonomy to support the risk appetite statement. the guiding principles are qualitative statements that guide risk-taking activities and are supported by quantitative metrics, risk limits, and risk appetite descriptions as defined in policy and managed through the erm framework.
risk culture all employees are considered risk managers, and are responsible for understanding pncs risk appetite statement, guiding principles and erm framework and how they apply to their respective roles. pncs governance structure establishes clear roles and responsibilities for risk management throughout the organization. all employees are encouraged to collaborate across groups to identify and mitigate risks and elevate issues as required. pnc reinforces risk management responsibilities through a performance management system where employee performance goals include risk management objectives. incentives for eligible employees incorporate risk management results through balanced measures of risk-adjusted performance.
proactive communication, between groups and up to the board of directors, facilitates timely identification and resolution of risk issues. pncs multi-level risk committee structure provides a formal channel to identify, decision, and report risk. risk committee membership includes representatives from business and risk stakeholder groups that are responsible for helping ensure risk issues are proactively identified, decisioned, monitored, communicated and managed appropriately within the enterprise risk management framework.
risk organization and governance pnc employs a comprehensive risk management governance structure to help ensure that risks are identified, balanced decisions are made that consider risk and return, and risks are adequately monitored and managed. risk committees established within this governance structure provide oversight for risk management activities at the board, corporate, and business levels. committee composition is designed to provide effective oversight balanced across the three lines of defense in accordance with the occs heightened risk management and governance expectations and guidelines. see further discussion in the supervision and regulation section in item 1 of this report. within the three lines of defense, the risk organization has sufficient authority to influence material decisions. the board oversees enterprise risk management of pnc for any material changes to the risk profile and periodically reviews core elements of enterprise risk including the risk appetite statement, risk capacity, appetite and strategy, and risk controls and limits.
we use our governance structure to assess the effectiveness of our risk management practices on an ongoing basis, based on how we manage our day-to-day business activities and on our development and execution of more specific strategies to mitigate risks. specific responsibilities include:
board of directors  the board oversees enterprise risk management. the risk committee of the board of directors evaluates pncs risk appetite, managements assessment of the enterprise risk profile, and the enterprise-wide risk structure and processes established by management to identify, measure, monitor, and manage risk. the audit committee of the board also has responsibility for select areas of risk (e.g., financial reporting, ethics and internal controls over financial reporting).
corporate committees  the corporate committees are responsible for overseeing risk standards and strategies, recommending risk limits, policies and metrics, monitoring risk exposures, reviewing risk profiles and key risk issues, and approving significant transactions and initiatives. at the management level, pnc has established several senior management-level committees to facilitate the review, evaluation, and management of risk. the management-level executive committee (ec) is the corporate committee that is responsible for developing enterprise-wide strategy and achieving pncs strategic objectives. the ec evaluates risk management, in part, by monitoring risk reporting from the other corporate committees, which are the supporting committees for ec.
working committees  the working committees are generally subcommittees of the corporate committees and include risk management committees for each of pncs major businesses or functions. working committees are intended to define, design and develop the risk management framework, including risk appetite, at the business or function level. the working committees help to implement key enterprise-level activities within a business or function. these committees recommend risk management policies for the business or function that are consistent with the enterprise-wide risk management objectives and policies. the business level committees are also responsible for approving significant initiatives under a certain threshold.
70 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k working groups  where appropriate, management will also form ad hoc groups (working groups) to address specific risk topics and report to a working committee or corporate committee. these working groups generally have a more narrow scope and may be limited in their duration.
policies and procedures  pnc has established risk management policies and procedures to provide direction, guidance, and clarity on roles and responsibilities to management and the board of directors. these policies and procedures are organized in a multi-tiered framework and require periodic review and approval by relevant committees within the governance structure.
business activities  our businesses strive to enhance risk management and internal control processes. integrated and comprehensive processes are designed to adequately identify, measure, manage, monitor, and report risks which may significantly impact each business.
risk identification and quantification risk identification takes place across a variety of risk types throughout the organization. these risk types consist of, but are not limited to, credit, operational, compliance, market, liquidity and model. risks are identified based on a balanced use of analytical tools and management judgment for both on- and off-balance sheet exposures. our governance structure supports risk identification by facilitating assessment of key risk issues, emerging risks, and idiosyncratic risks and implementation of mitigation strategies as appropriate. these risks are prioritized based on quantitative and qualitative analysis and assessed against the risk appetite. multiple tools and approaches are used to help identify and prioritize risks, including risk appetite metrics, key risk indicators (kris), key performance indicators (kpis), risk control and self-assessments (rcsas), scenario analysis, stress testing, special investigations and controls.
risks are aggregated and assessed within and across risk functions or businesses. the aggregated risk information is reviewed and reported at an enterprise level for adherence to the risk appetite as established through the policy framework and approved by the board of directors or by appropriate managing committees. this enterprise aggregation and reporting approach promotes the identification and appropriate escalation of material risks across the organization and supports an understanding of the cumulative impact of risk in relation to our risk appetite.
risk control and limits pnc uses a multi-tiered risk policy, procedure, and committee charter framework to provide direction and guidance for identifying, decisioning, monitoring, communicating and managing risk, including appropriate processes to escalate control parameter exceptions when applicable.
risk controls and limits provide the linkage from pncs risk appetite statement and associated guiding principles to the risk taking activities of our businesses. risk limits are quantitative measures, including forward looking assumptions, which allocate the firms aggregate risk appetite statement to lines of business and functional risk areas. they are established within policy across risk categories and are embedded within each risk appetite description.
when setting risk limits, pnc considers major risks, aligns with the established risk appetite, balances risk-reward, leverages analytics including stressed scenarios along with historical data, and adjusts limits in a timely manner in response to changes in internal and external environments. quantitative and qualitative operating guidelines support risk limits and serve as an early warning system for potential violations of the limits. these operating guidelines trigger mitigation strategies and management escalation protocols if limits are breached.
pncs control structure is balanced in terms of efficiency and effectiveness with the risks that we are willing to take, as defined by our risk appetite. controls are in place across the risk taxonomy to monitor established risk limits.
risk monitoring and reporting pnc uses similar tools to monitor and report risk as when performing risk identification. these tools include risk appetite metrics, kris, kpis, rcsas, scenario analysis, stress testing, special investigations and controls.
the risk identification and quantification processes, the risk control and limits reviews, and the tools used for risk monitoring provide the basis for risk reporting. the objective of risk reporting is comprehensive risk aggregation and transparent communication of aggregated risks, issues, risk level compared to appetite, outlook as well as mitigation strategies where appropriate, to the risk committee of the board of directors, corporate committees, working committees and other designated parties for effective decision making.
risk reports are produced at the line of business level, functional risk level and the enterprise level. the enterprise level risk report aggregates risks identified in the functional and business reports to define the enterprise risk profile. the enterprise risk profile is a point-in-time assessment of enterprise risk. the risk profile represents pncs overall risk position in relation to the desired enterprise risk appetite and overall risk capacity. the determination of the enterprise risk profile is based on analysis of quantitative reporting of risk limits and other measures along with qualitative assessments. quarterly aggregation of our risk profile enables a clear view of our risk level relative to our quantitative risk appetite and overall risk capacity. the enterprise level report is provided through the governance structure to the board of directors.

credit risk management credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. credit risk is one of our most significant risks. our processes for managing credit risk are embedded in pncs risk culture and in our decision-making processes using a systematic approach whereby credit risks and related exposures are identified and assessed, managed through specific policies and processes, measured and evaluated against our risk appetite and credit concentration limits, and reported, along with specific mitigation activities, to management and the board through our governance structure.
asset quality overview asset quality trends in 2014 improved from 2013.
                                                       nonperforming assets at december 31, 2014 decreased $577 million compared with december 31, 2013 as a result of improvements in both consumer and commercial nonperforming loans. consumer lending nonperforming loans decreased $224 million, commercial real estate nonperforming loans declined $184 million and commercial nonperforming loans decreased $167 million. nonperforming assets were
0.83% of total assets at december 31, 2014 compared with 1.08% at december 31, 2013.

                                            overall loan delinquencies of $1.9 billion decreased $.5 billion, or 22%, from year-end 2013 levels. the reduction was due in large part to a reduction in accruing government insured residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more of $.3 billion, the majority of which we took possession of and conveyed the real estate, or are in the process of conveyance and claim resolution.

                                          net charge-offs were $.5 billion in 2014, down 51% from net charge-offs in 2013 of $1.1 billion, due primarily to improved overall credit quality. net charge-offs for 2013 included $134 million of charge-offs due to the impact of alignment with interagency supervisory guidance on practices for loans and lines of credit related to consumer lending in the first quarter of 2013.

                               provision for credit losses in 2014 decreased to $273 million compared with $643 million in 2013. the smaller provision is attributed to improved overall credit quality, including lower consumer loan delinquencies, and the increasing value of residential real estate which resulted in greater expected cash flows from our purchased impaired loans.

   the level of alll decreased to $3.3 billion at december 31, 2014 from $3.6 billion at december 31, 2013.

nonperforming assets and loan delinquencies nonperforming assets, including oreo and foreclosed assets nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (tdrs), oreo and foreclosed assets. loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans, purchased impaired loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. additional information regarding our nonperforming loans and nonaccrual policies is included in note 1 accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report. the major categories of nonperforming assets are presented in table 30.
in the first quarter of 2013, we completed our alignment of certain nonaccrual and charge-off policies consistent with interagency supervisory guidance on practices for loans and lines of credit related to consumer lending. this alignment primarily related to (i) subordinate consumer loans (home equity loans and lines of credit and residential mortgages) where the first-lien loan was 90 days or more past due, (ii) government guaranteed loans where the guarantee may not result in collection of substantially all contractual principal and interest and (iii) certain loans with borrowers in or discharged from bankruptcy. in the first quarter of 2013, nonperforming loans increased by $426 million and net charge-offs increased by $134 million as a result of completing the alignment of the aforementioned policies. additionally, overall delinquencies decreased $395 million due to loans now being reported as either nonperforming or, in the case of loans accounted for under the fair value option, nonaccruing or having been charged off. certain consumer nonperforming loans were charged-off to the respective collateral value less costs to sell, and any associated allowance at the time of charge-off was reduced to zero. as the interagency guidance was adopted, incremental provision for credit losses was recorded if the related loan charge-off exceeded the associated allowance. subsequent declines in collateral value for these loans will result in additional charge-offs to maintain recorded investment at collateral value less costs to sell.
at december 31, 2014, tdrs included in nonperforming loans were $1.4 billion, or 55%, of total nonperforming loans compared to $1.5 billion, or 49%, of total nonperforming loans as of december 31, 2013. within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate tdrs comprise 60% of total residential real estate nonperforming loans at december 31, 2014, up from 59% at december 31, 2013. home equity tdrs comprise 54% of home equity nonperforming loans at both december 31, 2014 and at december 31, 2013. tdrs generally remain in nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of both principal and interest payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability

at december 31, 2014, our largest nonperforming asset was $35 million in the real estate, rental and leasing industry and our average nonperforming loans associated with commercial lending were under $1 million. all of the ten largest outstanding nonperforming assets are from the commercial lending portfolio and represent 21% and 4% of total commercial lending nonperforming loans and total nonperforming assets, respectively, as of december  31, 2014.

the table above presents nonperforming asset activity during 2014 and 2013, respectively. nonperforming assets decreased $577 million from $3.5 billion at december 31, 2013 to $2.9 billion at december 31, 2014, as a result of improvements in both consumer and commercial lending. consumer lending nonperforming loans decreased $224 million, commercial real estate nonperforming loans declined $184 million and commercial nonperforming loans decreased $167 million. as of december 31, 2014, approximately 90% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral which lessens reserve requirements and is expected to reduce credit losses in the event of default. as of december 31, 2014, commercial lending nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 65% of their unpaid principal balance, due to charge-offs recorded to date, before consideration of the alll. see note 3 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information on these loans.
purchased impaired loans are considered performing, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the original contractual terms), as we accrete interest income over the expected life of the loans. the accretable yield represents the excess of the expected cash flows on the loans at the measurement date over the carrying value. generally decreases, other than interest rate decreases for variable rate notes, in the net present value of expected cash flows of individual commercial or pooled purchased impaired loans would result in an impairment charge to the provision for credit losses in the period in which the change is deemed probable. generally increases in the net present value of expected cash flows of purchased impaired loans would first result in a recovery of previously recorded allowance for loan losses, to the extent applicable, and then an increase to accretable yield for the remaining life of the purchased impaired loans. total nonperforming loans and assets in the tables above are significantly lower than they would have been due to this accounting treatment for purchased impaired loans. this treatment also results in a lower ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans and a higher ratio of alll to nonperforming loans. see note 4 purchased loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information on these loans.
loan delinquencies we regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of loan portfolio asset quality. measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale and purchased impaired loans, but include government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option.
total early stage loan delinquencies (accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days) decreased from $1.0 billion at december 31, 2013 to $0.8 billion at december 31, 2014. the reduction in both consumer and commercial lending early stage delinquencies resulted from improved credit quality. see note 1 accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information regarding our nonperforming loan and nonaccrual policies.
accruing loans past due 90 days or more are referred to as late stage delinquencies. these loans are not included in nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest because they are well secured by collateral, and/or are in the process of collection, are managed in homogenous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines, or are certain government insured or guaranteed loans. these loans decreased $.4 billion, or 26%, from $1.5 billion at december 31, 2013 to $1.1 billion at december 31, 2014, mainly due to a decline in government insured residential real estate loans of $.3 billion, the majority of which we took possession of and conveyed the real estate, or are in the process of conveyance and claim resolution. the following tables display the delinquency status of our loans at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013. additional information regarding accruing loans past due is included in note 3 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report.

on a regular basis our special asset committee closely monitors loans, primarily commercial loans, that are not included in the nonperforming or accruing past due categories and for which we are uncertain about the borrowers ability to comply with existing repayment terms. these loans totaled $.2 billion at both december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013.
home equity loan portfolio our home equity loan portfolio totaled $34.7 billion as of december 31, 2014, or 17% of the total loan portfolio. of that total, $20.4 billion, or 59%, was outstanding under primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $14.3 billion, or 41%, consisted of closed-end home equity installment loans. approximately 3% of the home equity portfolio was on nonperforming status as of december 31, 2014.
as of december 31, 2014, we are in an originated first lien position for approximately 51% of the total portfolio and, where originated as a second lien, we currently hold or service the first lien position for approximately an additional 2% of the portfolio. the remaining 47% of the portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position. the credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we are in, hold or service the first lien position, is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien.
lien position information is generally based upon original ltv at the time of origination. however, after origination pnc is not typically notified when a senior lien position that is not held by pnc is satisfied. therefore, information about the current lien status of junior lien loans is less readily available in cases where pnc does not also hold the senior lien. additionally, pnc is not typically notified when a junior lien position is added after origination of a pnc first lien. this updated information for both junior and senior liens must be obtained from external sources, and therefore, pnc has contracted with an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan, lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.
we track borrower performance monthly, including obtaining original ltvs, updated fico scores at least quarterly, updated ltvs semi-annually, and other credit metrics at least quarterly, including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold. this information is used for internal reporting and risk management. for internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, brokered home equity lines of credit). as part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the home equity portfolio based upon the delinquency, modification status and bankruptcy status of these loans, as well as the delinquency, modification status and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower (regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien).
in establishing our alll for non-impaired loans, we primarily utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of loans. in accordance with accounting principles, under this methodology, we establish our allowance based upon incurred losses, not lifetime expected losses. the roll-rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state (e.g., 30-59 days past due) to another delinquency state (e.g., 60-89 days past due) and ultimately to charge-off. the roll through to charge-off is based on pncs actual loss experience for each type of pool. each of our home equity pools contains both first and second liens. our experience has been that the ratio of first to second lien loans has been consistent over time and the charge-off amounts for the pools, used to establish our allowance, include losses on both first and second liens loans.
generally, our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period, followed by a 20-year amortization term. during the draw period, we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay either interest or principal and interest. we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only, as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments. the risk associated with the borrowers ability to satisfy the loan terms upon the draw period ending is considered in establishing our alll. based upon outstanding balances at december 31, 2014, the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end.

(b)   includes approximately $154 million, $48 million, $57 million, $42 million and $564 million of home equity lines of credit with balloon payments, including those where we have terminated borrowing privileges, with draw periods scheduled to end in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and thereafter, respectively.

76 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k based upon outstanding balances, and excluding purchased impaired loans, at december 31, 2014, for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw (e.g., draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated), approximately 3% were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5% were 90 days or more past due. generally, when a borrower becomes 60 days past due, we terminate borrowing privileges and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated. at that point, we continue our collection/recovery processes, which may include loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a tdr.
see note 3 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information.
loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings consumer loan modifications we modify loans under government and pnc-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure, where appropriate. initially, a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program. if a borrower does not qualify under a government program, the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program. our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate, extend the term and/or defer principal. loans that are either temporarily or permanently modified under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as tdrs. further, loans that have certain types of payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as tdrs. additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 3 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report.
a temporary modification, with a term between 3 and 24 months, involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining term of the loan as of a specific date. a permanent modification, with a term greater than 24 months, is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed. permanent modification programs primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program (hamp) and pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs.
for home equity lines of credit, we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance. examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family or loss of employment. permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount, but our expectation is that the borrower can make payments at a lower amount.
we also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers needs while mitigating credit losses. table 37 provides the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans at the end of each year presented and table 38 provides the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified loans that were 60 days or more past due as of six months, nine months, twelve months and fifteen months after the modification date.

(a)                                           an account is considered in re-default if it is 60 days or more delinquent after modification. the data in this table represents loan modifications completed during the quarters ending june 30, 2013 through june 30, 2014 and represents a vintage look at all quarterly accounts and the number of those modified accounts (for each quarterly vintage) 60 days or more delinquent at six, nine, twelve, and fifteen months after modification. account totals include active and inactive accounts that were delinquent when they achieved inactive status. accounts that are no longer 60 days or more delinquent, or were re-modified since prior period, are removed from re-default status in the period in which they are cured or re-modified.

(b)   vintage refers to the quarter in which the modification occurred.

in addition to temporary loan modifications, we may make available to a borrower a payment plan or a hamp trial payment period. under a payment plan or a hamp trial payment period, there is no change to the loans contractual terms so the borrower remains legally responsible for payment of the loan under its original terms.
payment plans may include extensions, re-ages and/or forbearance plans. all payment plans bring an account current once certain requirements are achieved and are primarily intended to demonstrate a borrowers renewed willingness and ability to re-pay. due to the short term nature of the payment plan, there is a minimal impact to the alll.
under a hamp trial payment period, we establish an alternate payment, generally at an amount less than the contractual payment amount, for the borrower during this short time period. this allows a borrower to demonstrate successful payment performance
78 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k before permanently restructuring the loan into a hamp modification. subsequent to successful borrower performance under the trial payment period, we will capitalize the original contractual amount past due, to include accrued interest and fees receivable, and restructure the loans contractual terms, along with bringing the restructured account current. as the borrower is often already delinquent at the time of participation in the hamp trial payment period, generally enrollment in the program does not significantly increase the alll. if the trial payment period is unsuccessful, the loan will be evaluated for further action based upon our existing policies.
residential conforming and certain residential construction loans have been permanently modified under hamp or, if they do not qualify for a hamp modification, under pnc-developed programs, which in some cases may operate similarly to hamp. these programs first require a reduction of the interest rate followed by an extension of term and, if appropriate, deferral of principal payments. as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, 6,349 accounts with a balance of $.9 billion and 5,834 accounts with a balance of $.9 billion, respectively, of residential real estate loans had been modified under hamp and were still outstanding on our balance sheet.
commercial loan modifications and payment plans modifications of terms for commercial loans are based on individual facts and circumstances. commercial loan modifications may involve reduction of the interest rate, extension of the loan term and/or forgiveness of principal. modified commercial loans are usually already nonperforming prior to modification. we evaluate these modifications for tdr classification based upon whether we granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 3 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report.
we have established certain commercial loan modification and payment programs for small business loans, small business administration loans, and investment real estate loans. as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, $34 million and $47 million, respectively, in loan balances were covered under these modification and payment plan programs. of these loan balances, $12 million and $16 million have been determined to be tdrs as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively.
troubled debt restructurings a tdr is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. tdrs result from our loss mitigation activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. additionally, tdrs also result from borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to pnc. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, $1.2 billion of consumer loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and pooled purchased impaired loans, as well as certain government insured or guaranteed loans, were excluded from the tdr population. the comparable amount for the twelve months ended december 31, 2013 was $2.3 billion.

total tdrs decreased $156 million, or 6%, during 2014. nonperforming tdrs totaled $1.4 billion, which represents approximately 55% of total nonperforming loans, and 53% of total tdrs.
tdrs that are performing, including credit card loans, are excluded from nonperforming loans. these tdrs decreased $15 million, or 1%, during 2014 to $1.2 billion as of december 31, 2014. generally, the accruing category is comprised of loans where borrowers have been performing under the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months. loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to pnc and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status. see note 3 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information.

total net charge-offs are lower than they would have been otherwise due to the accounting treatment for purchased impaired loans. this treatment also results in a lower ratio of net charge-offs to average loans. see note 4 purchased loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information on net charge-offs related to these loans.
we maintain an alll to absorb losses from the loan and lease portfolio and determine this allowance based on quarterly assessments of the estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio. we maintain the alll at a level that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. the reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan and lease portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.
we establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using methods prescribed by gaap. all impaired loans are subject to individual analysis, except leases and large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans which may include, but are not limited to, credit card, residential real estate secured and consumer installment loans. specific allowances for individual loans (including commercial and consumer tdrs) are determined based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral.
reserves allocated to non-impaired commercial loan classes are based on pd and lgd credit risk ratings.
our commercial pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as pd and lgd. the results of these parameters are then applied to the loan balance and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit to determine the amount of the respective reserves. our pds and lgds are primarily determined using internal commercial loan loss data. this internal data is supplemented with third-party data and management judgment, as deemed necessary. we continue to evaluate and enhance our use of internal commercial loss data and will periodically update our pds and lgds as well as consider third-party data, regulatory guidance and management judgment.
the majority of the commercial portfolio is secured by collateral, including loans to asset-based lending customers, which continues to demonstrate lower lgd compared to loans not secured by collateral. further, the large investment grade or equivalent portion of the loan portfolio has performed well and has not been subject to significant deterioration. additionally, guarantees on loans greater than $1 million and owner guarantees for small business loans do not significantly impact our alll.
allocations to non-impaired consumer loan classes are primarily based upon a roll-rate model which uses statistical relationships, calculated from historical data that estimate the movement of loan outstandings through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off.
a portion of the alll is related to qualitative and measurement factors. these factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:
   industry concentrations and conditions,

   recent credit quality trends,

   recent loss experience in particular portfolios,

   recent macro-economic factors,

   model imprecision,

   changes in lending policies and procedures,

80 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k
   timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions, and

   limitations of available historical data.

pncs determination of the alll for non-impaired loans is sensitive to the risk grades assigned to commercial loans and loss rates for consumer loans. there are several other qualitative and quantitative factors considered in determining the alll. this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the alll. it is intended to provide insight into the impact of adverse changes to risk grades and loss rates only and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates. given the current processes used, we believe the risk grades and loss rates currently assigned are appropriate. in the hypothetical event that the aggregate weighted average commercial loan risk grades would experience a 1% deterioration, assuming all other variables remain constant, the allowance for commercial loans would increase by approximately $35 million as of december 31, 2014. in the hypothetical event that consumer loss rates would increase by 10%, assuming all other variables remain constant, the allowance for consumer loans would increase by approximately $37 million at december 31, 2014.
purchased impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value and applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carry over or creation of valuation allowances at acquisition. because the initial fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component, additional reserves are established when performance is expected to be worse than our expectations as of the acquisition date. at december 31, 2014, we had established reserves of $.9 billion for purchased impaired loans. in addition, loans (purchased impaired and non-impaired) acquired after january 1, 2009 were recorded at fair value. no allowance for loan losses was carried over and no allowance was created at the date of acquisition. see note 4 purchased loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information.
in determining the appropriateness of the alll, we make specific allocations to impaired loans and allocations to portfolios of commercial and consumer loans. we also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based upon current market conditions, which may not be reflected in historical loss data. commercial lending is the largest category of credits and is sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the alll. we have allocated approximately $1.6 billion, or 47%, of the alll at december 31, 2014 to the commercial lending category. consumer lending allocations are made based on historical loss experience adjusted for recent activity. approximately $1.7 billion, or 53%, of the alll at december 31, 2014 has been allocated to these consumer lending categories.
in addition to the alll, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. we report this allowance as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. we maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses on these unfunded credit facilities. we determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this methodology is very similar to the one we use for determining our alll.
we refer you to note 1 accounting policies and note 3 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further information on certain key asset quality indicators that we use to evaluate our portfolios and establish the allowances.

the provision for credit losses totaled $273 million for 2014 compared to $643 million for 2013. the primary drivers of the decrease to the provision were improved overall credit quality, including lower consumer loan delinquencies, and the increasing value of residential real estate which resulted in greater expected cash flows from our purchased impaired loans. for 2014, the provision for commercial lending credit losses increased by $64 million, or 178%, from 2013 primarily due to continued growth in the commercial book, paired with slowing of the reserve releases related to credit quality improvement. the provision for consumer lending credit losses decreased $434 million, or 71%, from 2013.

at december 31, 2014, total alll to total nonperforming loans was 133%. the comparable amount for december 31, 2013 was 117%. these ratios are 85% and 72%, respectively, when excluding the $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of alll at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 allocated to consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by residential real estate and purchased impaired loans. we have excluded consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by real estate as they are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and not placed on nonperforming status. additionally, we have excluded purchased impaired loans as they are considered performing regardless of their delinquency status as interest is accreted in accordance with asc 310-30 based on the recorded investment balance. additional allowance is recorded when the net present value of expected cash flows is lower than the recorded investment balance. see table 30 within this credit risk management section for additional information.
the alll balance increases or decreases across periods in relation to fluctuating risk factors, including asset quality trends, net charge-offs and changes in aggregate portfolio balances. during 2014, improved asset quality trends, including, but not limited to, delinquency status and improving economic conditions, as well as reduced net charge-offs and overall portfolio growth combined to result in the alll balance declining $.3 billion, or 8% to $3.3 billion as of december 31, 2014 compared to december 31, 2013.

operational risk management operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or external events. this includes losses that may arise as a result of non-compliance with laws or regulations, failure to fulfill fiduciary responsibilities, as well as litigation or other legal actions. operational risk may occur in any of our business activities and manifests itself in various ways, including but not limited to:
   transaction processing errors,

   unauthorized transactions and fraud by employees or third parties,

   material disruption in business activities,

   system breaches and misuse of sensitive information,

   regulatory or governmental actions, fines or penalties, and

   significant legal expenses, judgments or settlements.

pncs operational risk management is inclusive of technology risk management and business continuity risk. enterprise compliance is responsible for coordinating the compliance risk component of pncs operational risk framework. operational risk management focuses on balancing business needs, regulatory expectations and risk management priorities through an adaptive and proactive program that is designed to provide a strong governance model, sound and consistent risk management processes and transparent operational risk reporting across the enterprise.
the pnc board determines the strategic approach to operational risk via establishment of guiding principles, risk appetite and appropriate risk management structure. this includes establishment of risk metrics and limits and operational risk committee hierarchy and reporting structure to identify, understand and manage operational risks.
executive management has responsibility for operational risk management. the executive management team is responsible for monitoring significant risks, key controls and related issues through management reporting and a governance structure of risk committees, to help ensure that objectives are pursued within the bounds of our risk appetite.
within the independent risk management function, operational risk management (orm) is responsible for developing and maintaining the policies, methodologies, tools, and technology utilized across the enterprise to identify, assess, monitor, and report operational risks. orm monitors enterprise-wide adherence with related policies and procedures and regularly assesses overall program effectiveness. in addition, orm independently challenges the results and conclusions generated by the business units during the execution of the operational risk management program.
business unit management is responsible for the day-to-day management of operational risks inherent in the products, services, and activities for which they are responsible. business unit management is also responsible for adhering to pncs enterprise-wide operational risk management policies and procedures including regularly identifying, measuring, and monitoring operational risks in their respective areas, as well as capturing, analyzing and reporting operational risks and issues.
management of operational risk is based upon a comprehensive framework designed to enable pnc to determine the enterprise and individual business units operational risk profile in comparison to the established risk appetite and identify operational risks that may require further mitigation. this framework is established around a set of enterprise-wide policies and a system of internal controls that are designed to manage risk and to provide management with timely and accurate information about the operations of pnc. this framework employs a number of techniques to manage operational risk, including:
   risk and control self assessments (rcsas) that are performed at least annually across pncs businesses, processes, systems and products. rcsa methodology

82 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k is a standard process for business units to document and assess operational risks, evaluate key control design and operating effectiveness, and determine if control enhancements are required,

                                                    a scenario analysis program that is leveraged to proactively evaluate operational risks with the potential for severe business, financial, operational or regulatory impact on the company or a major business unit. this methodology leverages standard processes and tools to evaluate a wide range of business and operational risks encompassing both external and internal events relevant to the company.
based upon scenario analysis conclusions, management may implement additional controls or risk management activities to reduce exposure to an acceptable level,

                                                    a metrics and key risk indicator framework that allows management to proactively monitor and assess shifts in operational risk exposure or key control effectiveness compared to expectations and thresholds. enterprise-level operational risk appetite metrics support pncs operational risk management framework and guiding principles with the objective of maintaining a risk profile within risk appetite. a broad set of operational risk indicators are in place to monitor and report exposures across the different inherent operational risk types. lastly, business-specific risk indicators are established to monitor the most significant risks and controls identified in the individual risk and control self assessments, and

                                                 operational loss events as well as technology and operational breakdowns that do not result in direct loss (near miss events) across the enterprise are continuously captured and maintained in a central repository. this information is analyzed and used to help determine the root causes of these events and to identify trends that could indicate changes in the companys risk exposure or control effectiveness. pncs external loss event program utilizes a number of sources to monitor and identify external loss events occurring across the financial services industry. relevant external events are evaluated by appropriate business and risk management personnel to determine whether pnc is exposed to similar events, and if so, whether appropriate controls are in place.

we continue to refine our methodology to estimate capital requirements for operational risk using a proprietary version of an advanced measurement approach (ama) as prescribed in basel ii. under the ama, the results of the program elements described above are key inputs directly incorporated into the capital calculation methodology.
risk professionals from operational risk, technology risk management, compliance and legal work closely with business areas to evaluate risks and challenge that appropriate key controls are established prior to the introduction of new or enhanced products, services and technologies. these risk professionals also challenge business units design and implementation of mitigation strategies to address risks and issues identified through ongoing assessment and monitoring activities.
pncs technology risk management (trm) program is aligned with the operational risk framework. technology risk represents the risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of technology within an enterprise.
management of technology risk is embedded into the culture and decision-making processes of pnc through an information and technology risk management framework designed to help ensure secure, sound, and compliant it systems and infrastructure in support of business strategies and goals. the management of technology risk is a core business skill and an integral part of day-to-day activity.
cybersecurity is a principal concern for financial institutions and is a very high priority for pnc. the ever changing and complex threat landscape is closely monitored and pnc participates in proactive information sharing with intelligence sources, law enforcement, and the private sector. the cyber security program is based on a continuous improvement strategy by assessing current and emerging threats to protect our critical business functions, as well as the integrity, privacy, and confidentiality of data. we continue to strengthen our controls, processes and systems to help protect our networks, computers, software, and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. see item 1a risk factors in this report for additional information regarding the risk of a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of, or security breaches affecting, those systems.
managers and staff at all levels are responsible for applying risk management policies, procedures, and strategies in their areas of responsibility. pncs trm function supports enterprise management of technology risk by independently assessing technology and information security risks, and by serving in an oversight role by measuring, monitoring, and challenging enterprise technology capabilities. specifically, technology risk management has the following objectives:
   a sound control infrastructure is in place to effectively manage technology risks to help drive informed business decisions,

   technology risks related to ongoing business and operational activities are identified, assessed, and monitored,

   technology risks related to new key initiatives are assessed and appropriately managed, and

   emerging technology risks are monitored and assessed to verify their potential impact to pncs overall risk profile.

to support pncs overall risk profile within risk appetite and the enterprise risk appetite statement, technology risk management has established governance, operating structures, metrics, and guiding principles designed to ensure that technology risk is distinctly considered in business activities and strategic decision making processes.
pnc has defined an enterprise-wide business continuity program that provides structure and guidelines to ensure resiliency and recovery of pncs facilities, employees, suppliers and technology should there be a business disruption. it is a comprehensive program based upon a life cycle containing repeatable activities to identify and mitigate internal and external business disruptive threats. it is the responsibility of pncs business units to execute and comply with the business continuity program. the program is administered by a separate group, with governance and oversight being provided by additional resources in the independent risk management function.
pncs corporate insurance group is responsible for managing insurance risk across the organization, and is aligned within the enterprise risk management governance framework. pnc retains select corporate risks through its wholly-owned captive insurance company alpine indemnity limited, and transfers excess risk through the purchase of insurance where appropriate, to mitigate the effects of operational loss events. pncs risks associated with its participation as an insurer for these programs are mitigated through policy and annual aggregate limits. decisions surrounding pncs retention of its operating risks through deductibles or captive participation are made in conjunction with the enterprise risk management governance framework.
the corporate insurance group monitors and manages insurable risks through a combination of risk mitigation, retention and transfer consistent with the organizations risk appetite and philosophy. to ensure the lines of business have a clear understanding of insurance risk and the ability to retain or transfer risk, management holds regular meetings with the lines of business regarding risk evaluation and the utilization of insurance as a risk transfer technique. furthermore, corporate insurance management and the insurance risk committee have primary oversight of reporting insurance related activities through the governance structure that allows management to fully vet risk information.
quarterly, an enterprise operational risk report is developed to report key operational risks to senior management and the board of directors. the report encompasses key operational risk management conclusions, including the overall operational risk level, risk management effectiveness and outlook, grounded in quantitative measures and qualitative factors. key enterprise operational risks are also included in the enterprise risk report. in addition, operational risk is an integrated part of the quarterly business-specific risk reports.
compliance risk enterprise compliance is responsible for coordinating the compliance risk component of pncs operational risk framework. compliance issues are identified and tracked through enterprise-wide monitoring and tracking programs. key compliance risk issues are escalated through a comprehensive risk reporting process at both a business and enterprise level and incorporated, as appropriate, into the development and assessment of the firms operational risk profile. the compliance, conflicts & ethics policy committee, chaired by the chief compliance officer, provides oversight for compliance, conflicts and ethics programs and strategies across pnc. this committee also oversees the compliance processes related to fiduciary and investment risk. in order to help understand, and where appropriate, proactively address emerging regulatory issues, enterprise compliance communicates regularly with various regulators with supervisory or regulatory responsibilities with respect to pnc, its subsidiaries or businesses and participates in forums focused on regulatory and compliance matters in the financial services industry.
risk professionals from operational risk, technology risk management, compliance and legal work closely with business areas to evaluate risks and challenge that appropriate key controls are established prior to the introduction of new or enhanced products, services and technologies. these risk professionals also challenge business units design and implementation of mitigation strategies to address risks and issues identified through ongoing assessment and monitoring activities.
84 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k model risk management pnc relies on quantitative models to measure risks, to estimate certain financial values, and to support or inform certain business decisions. models may be used in processes such as determining the pricing of various products, grading and granting loans, measuring interest rate risks and other market risks, predicting losses, and assessing capital adequacy, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.
there are risks involved in the use of models as they have the potential to provide inaccurate output or results, could be used for purposes other than those for which they have been designed, or may be operated in an uncontrolled environment where unauthorized changes can take place and where other control risks exist.
the model risk management group is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed, and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise. the model risk management group, a subgroup of the enterprise risk management committee, oversees all aspects of model risk, including pncs compliance with regulatory requirements related to model risk management, and approves exceptions to policy when appropriate.
to better manage our business, our practices around the use of models, and to comply with regulatory guidance and requirements, we have policies and procedures in place that define our governance processes for assessing and controlling model risk. these processes focus on identifying, reporting and remediating any problems with the soundness, accuracy, improper use or operating environment of our models. we recognize that models must be monitored over time to ensure their continued accuracy and functioning, and our policies also address the type and frequency of performance monitoring that is appropriate according to the importance of each model. pnc also monitors key metrics designed to assess our level of model risk and its alignment with our risk appetite.
there are a number of practices we undertake to identify and control model risk. a primary consideration is that models be well understood by those who use them as well as by other parties. our policies require detailed written model documentation for significant models to assist in making their use transparent and understood by users, independent reviewers, and regulatory and auditing bodies. the documentation must include details on the data and methods used to develop each model, assumptions utilized within the model, an assessment of model performance and a description of model limitations and circumstances in which a model should not be relied upon.
our modeling methods and data are reviewed by independent model reviewers not involved in the development of the model to identify possible errors or areas where the soundness of the model could be in question. issues identified by the independent reviewer are tracked and reported using our existing governance structure until the issue has been fully remediated.
it is important that models operate in a controlled environment where access to code or the ability to make changes is limited to those who are authorized to do so. additionally, proper back-up and recovery mechanisms are needed for the ongoing functioning of models. our use of independent model control reviewers aids in the evaluation of the existing control mechanisms to help ensure that controls are appropriate and are functioning properly.

liquidity risk management liquidity risk has two fundamental components. the first is potential loss assuming we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. the second is the potential inability to operate our businesses because adequate contingent liquidity is not available. we manage liquidity risk at the consolidated company level (bank, parent company, and nonbank subsidiaries combined) to help ensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal business as usual and stressful circumstances, and to help ensure that we maintain an appropriate level of contingent liquidity.
management monitors liquidity through a series of early warning indicators that may indicate a potential market, or pnc-specific, liquidity stress event. in addition, management performs a set of liquidity stress tests over multiple time horizons with varying levels of severity and maintains a contingency funding plan to address a potential stress event. in the most severe liquidity stress simulation, we assume that pncs liquidity position is under pressure, while the market in general is under systemic pressure. the simulation considers, among other things, the impact of restricted access to both secured and unsecured external sources of funding, accelerated run-off of customer deposits, valuation pressure on assets and heavy demand to fund contingent obligations. parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet our parent company obligations over the succeeding 24-month period. liquidity-related risk limits are established within our enterprise liquidity management policy and supporting policies. management committees, including the asset and liability committee, and the board of directors and its risk committee regularly review compliance with key established limits.
in addition to these liquidity monitoring measures and tools described above, pnc also monitors its liquidity by reference to the lcr, a new regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a 30-day stress scenario. the lcr is calculated by dividing the amount of an institutions high quality, unencumbered liquid assets (hqla), as defined and calculated in accordance with the haircuts and limitations of the lcr rules, by its estimated net cash outflow, with net cash outflows determined by applying assumed outflow factors in the lcr rules. the resulting quotient is expressed as a percentage. for pnc and pnc bank, the lcr became effective january 1, 2015. the minimum required lcr and the requirement to calculate the lcr on a daily basis will be phased-in over a period of years. for 2015, pnc and pnc bank are required to calculate the lcr on a month-end basis and the minimum lcr that pnc and pnc bank are required to maintain is 80%.
as of january 31, 2015, pnc and pnc bank exceeded the minimum lcr requirement in effect for 2015. the estimated january 31, 2015 lcr calculation and the underlying components are based on pncs current interpretation and understanding of the final lcr rules and are subject to, among other things, further regulatory guidance.
we provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on pnc in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 business and item 1a risk factors of this report.
bank level liquidity  uses at the bank level, primary contractual obligations include funding loan commitments, satisfying deposit withdrawal requests and maturities and debt service related to bank borrowings. as of december 31, 2014, there were approximately $7.2 billion of bank borrowings with contractual maturities of less than one year. we also maintain adequate bank liquidity to meet future potential loan demand and provide for other business needs, as necessary. see the bank level liquidity  sources section below.
bank level liquidity  sources our largest source of bank liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base generated by our retail and commercial businesses. total deposits increased to $232.2 billion at december 31, 2014 from $220.9 billion at december 31, 2013, primarily driven by growth in transaction deposits. assets determined by pnc to be liquid (liquid assets) and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to maintain our liquidity position. borrowed funds come from a diverse mix of short-term and long-term funding sources.
at december 31, 2014, our liquid assets consisted of short-term investments (federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities and interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling $36.0 billion and securities available for sale totaling $44.2 billion. the level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. of our total liquid assets of $80.2 billion, we had $6.1 billion of securities available for sale and trading securities pledged as collateral to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes. in addition to the liquid assets we pledged, $4.8 billion of securities held to maturity were also pledged as collateral for these purposes.
in addition to the customer deposit base, which has historically provided the single largest source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, the bank also obtains liquidity through the issuance of traditional forms of funding including long-term debt (senior notes and subordinated debt and fhlb advances) and short-term borrowings (federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper issuances and other short-term borrowings).
86 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k on january 16, 2014, pnc bank established a new bank note program under which it may from time to time offer up to $25 billion aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes due more than nine months from their date of issue (in the case of senior notes) and due five years or more from their date of issue (in the case of subordinated notes). the $25 billion of notes authorized to be issued and outstanding at any one time includes notes issued by pnc bank prior to january 16, 2014 under the 2004 bank note program and those notes pnc bank has assumed through the acquisition of other banks, in each case for so long as such notes remain outstanding. the terms of the new program do not affect any of the bank notes issued prior to january 16, 2014. at december 31, 2014, pnc bank had $16.0 billion of bank notes outstanding. the following table details all issuances during 2014:

see note 25 subsequent events in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information on the issuance of senior notes of $750 million and $1.0 billion on february 23, 2015.
pnc bank is a member of the fhlb-pittsburgh and, as such, has access to advances from fhlb-pittsburgh secured generally by residential mortgage loans, other mortgage-related loans and commercial mortgage-backed securities. at december 31, 2014, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $13.9 billion with fhlb-pittsburgh. total fhlb borrowings increased to $20.0 billion at december 31, 2014 from $12.9 billion at december  31, 2013 due to the following activity in the period.

the fhlb-pittsburgh also periodically provides standby letters of credit on behalf of pnc bank to secure certain public deposits. pnc bank began using standby letters of credit issued by the fhlb-pittsburgh in response to the regulatory liquidity standards finalized during 2014. if the fhlb-pittsburgh is required to make payment for a beneficiarys draw, the payment amount is converted into a collateralized advance to pnc bank. at both december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, standby letters of credit issued on our behalf by the fhlb-pittsburgh totaled $6.2 billion.
pnc bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. as of december 31, 2014, there was $5.0 billion outstanding under this program. during the fourth quarter of 2013, pnc finalized the wind down of market street funding llc (market street), a multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper conduit administered by pnc bank. as part of the wind down process, the commitments and outstanding loans of market street were assigned to pnc bank, which will fund these commitments and loans by utilizing its diversified funding sources. in conjunction with the assignment of commitments and loans, the associated liquidity facilities were terminated along with the program-level credit enhancement provided to market street. the wind down did not have a material impact to pncs financial condition or results of operations.
pnc bank can also borrow from the federal reserve bank of clevelands (federal reserve bank) discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements. the federal reserve bank, however, is not viewed as the primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. these potential borrowings are secured by commercial loans. at december 31, 2014, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $15.6 billion with the federal reserve bank.
parent company liquidity as of december 31, 2014, available parent company liquidity totaled $7.1 billion. parent company liquidity is primarily held in short-term investments, the terms of which provide for the availability of cash in 31 days or less. investments with longer durations may also be acquired, but if so, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.
parent company liquidity  uses the parent companys contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. as of december 31, 2014, there were approximately $2.5 billion of parent company borrowings with contractual maturities of less than one year. additionally, the parent company maintains adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to pnc shareholders, share repurchases, and acquisitions. see the parent company liquidity  sources section below.
see capital and liquidity actions in the executive summary section of this item 7 for information on our 2014 capital plan that was accepted by the federal reserve, which included certain share repurchases that are described in more detail in the capital portion of the consolidated balance sheet review section in this item 7 and the dividend increase described below.
88 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k on april 3, 2014, consistent with our 2014 capital plan, our board of directors approved an increase to pncs quarterly common stock dividend from 44 cents per common share to 48 cents per common share beginning with the may 5, 2014 dividend payment.
in connection with the 2015 ccar, pnc submitted its 2015 capital plan, as approved by its board of directors, to the federal reserve in january 2015. pnc expects to receive the federal reserves response (either a non-objection or objection) to the capital plan submitted as part of the 2015 ccar in march 2015.
see the supervision and regulation section in item 1 of this report for additional information regarding the federal reserves ccar process and the factors the federal reserve takes into consideration in evaluating capital plans, qualitative and quantitative liquidity risk management standards proposed by the u.s. banking agencies, and final rules issued by the federal reserve that make certain modifications to the federal reserves capital planning and stress testing rules.
see table 42 for information on affiliate purchases of notes issued by pnc bank during 2014.
on february 6, 2015, pnc used $600 million of parent company/non-bank subsidiary cash to purchase floating rate senior notes that were issued by pnc bank to an affiliate on that same date.
parent company liquidity  sources the principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends it receives from its subsidiary bank, which may be impacted by the following:
   bank-level capital needs,

   laws and regulations,

   corporate policies,

   contractual restrictions, and

   other factors.

there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. the amount available for dividend payments by pnc bank to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was approximately $1.5 billion at december 31, 2014. see note 20 regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for a further discussion of these limitations. we provide additional information on certain contractual restrictions in note 12 capital securities of a subsidiary trust and perpetual trust securities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
in addition to dividends from pnc bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments.
we can also generate liquidity for the parent company and pncs non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. we have an effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which we can issue additional debt, equity and other capital instruments.
during 2014, we issued the following parent company debt under our shelf registration statement:
   $750 million of subordinated notes with a maturity date of april 29, 2024. interest is payable semi-annually, at a fixed rate of 3.90%, on april 29 and october 29 of each year, beginning on october 29, 2014.

total parent company senior and subordinated debt and hybrid capital instruments decreased to $10.1 billion at december 31, 2014 from $10.7 billion at december 31, 2013 due to the following activity in the period.

on october 16, 2014, the parent company established a $5.0 billion commercial paper program to provide additional liquidity. as of december 31, 2014, there were no issuances outstanding under this program. following the establishment of this parent company program, pnc funding corp terminated its $3.0 billion commercial paper program.
note 17 equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report describes the 16,885,192 warrants outstanding, each to purchase one share of pnc common stock at an exercise price of $67.33 per share. these warrants were sold by the u.s. treasury in a secondary public offering in may 2010 after the u.s. treasury exchanged its tarp warrant. these warrants will expire december 31, 2018, and are considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share in note 16 earnings per share in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
status of credit ratings the cost and availability of short-term and long-term funding, as well as collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments, is influenced by pncs debt ratings.
in general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied government support. in the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k 89
addition, rating agencies themselves have been subject to scrutiny arising from the most recent financial crisis and could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices, particularly in response to legislative and regulatory changes. potential changes in the legislative and regulatory environment and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings, which as noted above, could impact our liquidity and financial condition. a decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition.

at december 31, 2014, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $77 million, which represents a reserve for tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which ultimately may not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, this estimate has been excluded from the contractual obligations table. see note 19 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information.
our contractual obligations totaled $73.5 billion at december 31, 2013. the increase in the comparison is primarily attributable to an increase in borrowed funds partially offset by the decline in time deposits. see funding sources in the consolidated balance sheet review section of this item 7 for additional information regarding our funding sources.

90 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k our total commitments totaled $146.8 billion at december 31, 2013. the increase in the comparison is primarily due to an increase in exposure on net unfunded loan commitments partially offset by a decline in reinsurance agreements and net outstanding standby letters of credit. see note 22 commitments and guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information on net unfunded loan commitments, our reinsurance agreements, net outstanding standby letters of credit, and certain other commitments.
market risk management market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. we are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among others:
   traditional banking activities of taking deposits and extending loans,

   equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and

   fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities, as a result of customer activities and securities underwriting.

we have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. market risk management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with these limits and guidelines, and reporting significant risks in the business to the risk committee of the board.
market risk management  interest rate risk interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.
asset and liability management centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management policies, which are approved by managements asset and liability committee and the risk committee of the board.

in addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. table 50 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12-month periods assuming (i) the pnc economists most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates and (iii) yield curve slope flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening between 1-month and ten-year rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario.

second year sensitivity           5.3   %         3.6   %            (4.8   )%
all changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.
when forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. these assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in tables 49 and 50 above.
the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k 91
these simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current market rates. we also consider forward projections of purchase accounting accretion when forecasting net interest income.
the following graph presents the libor/swap yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward.
table 51: alternate interest rate scenarios: one year forward the fourth quarter 2014 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our consolidated balance sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates and an upward sloping interest rate yield curve. we believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market conditions.
market risk management  customer-related trading risk we engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers investing and hedging activities. these transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment (cva) related to our customer derivatives portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. we do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.
we use value-at-risk (var) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. we calculate a diversified var at a 95% confidence interval. var is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. a diversified var reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes.
during 2014, our 95% var ranged between $.8 million and $3.9 million, averaging $2.1 million. during 2013, our 95% var ranged between $1.7 million and $5.5 million, averaging $3.5 million.
to help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate var for each portfolio and enterprise-wide, we use a process known as backtesting. the backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of gains or losses against the var levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day. this assumes that market exposures remain constant throughout the day and that recent historical market variability is a good predictor of future variability. our customer-related trading activity includes customer revenue and intraday hedging which helps to reduce losses, and may reduce the number of instances of actual losses exceeding the prior day var measure. there were two instances during 2014 under our diversified var measure where actual losses exceeded the prior day var measure. in comparison, there was one such instance during 2013. we use a 500 day look back period for backtesting and include customer-related trading revenue.
the following graph shows a comparison of enterprise-wide gains and losses against prior day diversified var for the period indicated.

(b)   includes changes in fair value for certain loans accounted for at fair value.

customer-related trading revenues for 2014 decreased $86 million compared with 2013. the decrease was primarily due to market interest rate changes impacting credit valuations for customer-related derivatives activities and reduced derivatives client sales revenues, which were partially offset by improved securities and foreign exchange client sales results.
92 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k market risk management  equity and other investment risk equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. in addition to extending credit, taking deposits, securities underwriting and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. we also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity and in debt and equity-oriented hedge funds. the economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets such as loan servicing rights are directly affected by changes in market factors.
the primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is economic capital. economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit, market and operational risk. it is an estimate of the potential value depreciation over a one year horizon commensurate with solvency expectations of an institution rated single-a by the credit rating agencies. given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments, it can be a challenge to determine their fair values. see note 7 fair value in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information.
various pnc business units manage our equity and other investment activities. our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.

blackrock pnc owned approximately 35 million common stock equivalent shares of blackrock equity at december 31, 2014, accounted for under the equity method. the primary risk measurement, similar to other equity investments, is economic capital. the business segments review section of this item 7 includes additional information about blackrock.
tax credit investments included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated partnerships which totaled $2.6 billion at both december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013. these equity investment balances include unfunded commitments totaling $717 million and $802 million at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. these unfunded commitments are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
note 2 loan sale and servicing activities and variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report has further information on tax credit investments.
private equity the private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio comprised of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment.
private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.6 billion at december 31, 2014 and $1.7 billion at december 31, 2013. as of december 31, 2014, $1.1 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $.5 billion was invested indirectly through various private equity funds. included in direct investments are investment activities of two private equity funds that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. the noncontrolling interests of these funds totaled $212 million as of december 31, 2014. the interests held in indirect private equity funds are not redeemable, but pnc may receive distributions over the life of the partnership from liquidation of the underlying investments. see item 1 business  supervision and regulation and item 1a risk factors of this report for discussion of the potential impacts of the volcker rule provisions of dodd-frank on our interests in and sponsorship of private funds covered by the volcker rule.
our unfunded commitments related to private equity totaled $140 million at december 31, 2014 compared with $164 million at december 31, 2013.

visa during 2014, we sold 3.5 million visa class b common shares, in addition to the 13 million shares sold in the previous two years. we have entered into swap agreements with the purchaser of the shares as part of these sales. see note 7 fair value in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information. at december 31, 2014, our investment in visa class b common shares totaled approximately 7 million shares and had a carrying value of $77 million. based on the december 31, 2014 closing price of $262.20 for the visa class a common shares, the fair value of our total investment was approximately $742 million at the current conversion rate, which reflects adjustments in respect of all litigation funding by visa to date. the visa class b common shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances (including those applicable to the sales in 2014 and the previous two years) until they can be converted into shares of the publicly traded class of stock, which cannot happen until the settlement of all of the specified litigation.
note 21 legal proceedings and note 22 commitments and guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report have additional information regarding the october 2007 visa restructuring, our involvement with judgment and loss sharing agreements with visa and certain other banks, and the status of pending interchange litigation.
other investments we also make investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. the economic values could be driven by either the fixed-income market or the equity markets, or both. at december 31, 2014, other investments totaled $155 million compared with $234 million at december 31, 2013. we recognized net gains related to these investments of $19 million during 2014, compared with $39 million during 2013.
given the nature of these investments, if market conditions affecting their valuation were to worsen, we could incur future losses.
our unfunded commitments related to other investments were immaterial at both december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013.
see the supervision and regulation section of item 1 business and item 1a risk factors of this report for additional information on the potential impact of the volcker rule on pncs investments in and relationships with private funds that are covered by that rule, as well as pncs ability to maximize the value of its investments in such funds.
impact of inflation our assets and liabilities are primarily financial in nature and typically have varying maturity dates. accordingly, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. however, during periods of inflation, there may be a subsequent impact affecting certain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of consumer and customer purchasing power, and fluctuations in the need or demand for our products and services. should significant levels of inflation occur, our business could potentially be impacted by, among other things, reducing our tolerance for extending credit or causing us to incur additional credit losses resulting from possible increased default rates.
financial derivatives we use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates. interest rate and total return swaps, interest rate caps and floors, swaptions, options, forwards and futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for interest rate risk management. we also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities.
financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. for interest rate swaps and total return swaps, options and futures contracts, only periodic cash payments and, with respect to options, premiums are exchanged. therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments.
further information on our financial derivatives is presented in note 1 accounting policies, note 7 fair value and note 15 financial derivatives in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, which is incorporated here by reference.
not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.

2013 versus 2012
consolidated income statement review summary results net income for 2013 was $4.2 billion, or $7.36 per diluted common share, compared with $3.0 billion, or $5.28 per diluted common share, for 2012. the increase was driven by an 8% decline in noninterest expense, a 3% increase in revenue and lower provision for credit losses. the decline in noninterest expense reflected our continued focus on disciplined expense management. higher revenue in the comparison was driven by improvement in the provision for residential mortgage repurchase obligations, strong client fee income and higher gains on asset valuations, partially offset by lower net interest income and lower gains on asset sales.
net interest income net interest income decreased by $493 million, or 5%, in 2013 compared with 2012, reflecting a decline in purchase accounting accretion in the comparison, the impact of lower yields on loans and securities, and the impact of lower securities balances. these decreases were partially offset by higher loan balances, reflecting commercial and consumer loan growth over the period, and lower rates paid on borrowed funds and deposits. total purchase accounting accretion was $.8 billion for 2013 compared to $1.1 billion in 2012.
net interest margin declined 37 basis points in 2013 compared with 2012 due to lower purchase accounting accretion and lower yields on interest-earning assets, which decreased 48 basis points, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted-average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities of 14 basis points.
the decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets was primarily due to lower rates on new loans and purchased securities in the ongoing low interest rate environment, as well as the impact of higher levels of interest-earning deposits with banks maintained in light of anticipated regulatory requirements. the decrease in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to redemptions of higher-rate bank notes and senior debt and subordinated debt, including the redemption of trust preferred and hybrid capital securities.
noninterest income noninterest income increased to $6.9 billion in 2013 compared to $5.9 billion in 2012, due to higher residential mortgage revenue, which was driven by improvement in the provision for residential mortgage repurchase obligations, strong client fee income and higher gains on asset valuations, partially offset by lower gains on asset sales. noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 43% for 2013, up from 38% for 2012.
asset management revenue increased to $1.3 billion in 2013 compared to $1.2 billion in 2012, driven by higher earnings from our blackrock investment, stronger average equity markets and strong sales resulting in positive net flows, after adjustments for cyclical client activities. discretionary client assets under management increased to $127 billion at december 31, 2013 compared with $112 billion at december 31, 2012.
the increase in consumer service fees to $1.3 billion in 2013 compared to $1.1 billion in 2012 was due to growth in brokerage fees and the impact of higher customer-initiated fee based transactions.
corporate services revenue increased $44 million, or 4%, to $1.2 billion in 2013 compared with 2012. this increase included the impact of higher valuation gains from rising interest rates on net commercial mortgage servicing rights valuations, which were gains of $68 million in 2013 compared the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k 95
with $31 million for 2012. the increase in corporate services revenue was primarily due to higher net commercial mortgage servicing rights valuations, higher commercial mortgage fees, net of amortization, and higher treasury management fees, partially offset by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees.
residential mortgage revenue increased to $871 million in 2013 from $284 million in 2012. the increase was driven by improvement in the provision for residential mortgage repurchase obligations, which was a benefit of $53 million in 2013 compared with a provision of $761 million in 2012. the release of reserves in 2013 was largely the result of agreements with two government-sponsored enterprises (gses), fhlmc and fnma, for loans sold into agency securitizations. see the recourse and repurchase obligations section of this item 7 and item 7 in our 2013 form 10-k for further detail. this benefit was partially offset by lower loan sales revenue resulting from an increase in mortgage interest rates which had the effect of reducing gain on sale margins and, to a lesser extent, loan origination volume.
service charges on deposits were $597 million in 2013 compared with $573 million in 2012.
net gains on sales of securities totaled $99 million for 2013 and $204 million for 2012. the net credit component of other-than-temporary impairment (otti) of securities recognized in earnings was $16 million in 2013 compared with $111 million for 2012.
other noninterest income increased by $58 million, or 4%, to $1.5 billion in 2013 due to higher revenue associated with private equity investments and commercial mortgage loans held for sale. in addition, the increase reflected higher revenue from credit valuations for customer-related derivatives activities as higher market interest rates reduced the fair value of pncs credit exposure on these activities. the impact to 2013 revenue due to these credit valuations was $56 million, while the impact to 2012 revenue was not significant. these increases were partially offset by lower gains on sale of visa class b common shares, which were $168 million on the sale of 4 million shares in 2013 compared with gains of $267 million on the sale of 9 million shares in 2012. we held approximately 10 million visa class b common shares with a fair value of approximately $971 million and recorded investment of $158 million as of december 31, 2013.
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses totaled $643 million in 2013 compared with $987 million in 2012. the decrease in provision compared to prior year was the result of continued credit quality improvement, including improvement in our purchased impaired loan portfolio. increasing value of residential real estate resulted in greater expected cash flows from our purchased impaired loans.
noninterest expense noninterest expense was $9.7 billion for 2013, a decrease of $.8 billion, or 8%, from $10.5 billion for 2012. the decline reflected the impact of 2012 integration costs of $267 million and a reduction in noncash charges related to redemption of trust preferred securities to $57 million in 2013 from $295 million in 2012. additionally, residential mortgage foreclosure-related expenses declined to $56 million from $225 million in the same comparison. these decreases to noninterest expense were partially offset by the impact of a full year of operating expense for the march 2012 rbc bank (usa) acquisition during 2013 compared to 2012.
in the third quarter of 2013, we concluded redemptions of discounted trust preferred securities assumed in our acquisitions. from the fourth quarter of 2011 through 2013, we redeemed a total of $3.2 billion of these higher-rate trust preferred securities, resulting in noncash charges totaling approximately $550 million. see note 14 capital securities of subsidiary trusts and perpetual trust securities in item 8 of our 2013 form 10-k and 2012 form 10-k for more information on our redemption of trust preferred securities in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate was 25.9% in both 2013 and 2012. the effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits pnc receives from our investments in low income housing and new markets investments, as well as earnings in other tax exempt investments.
consolidated balance sheet review loans loans increased $9.8 billion to $195.6 billion as of december 31, 2013 compared with december 31, 2012. the increase in loans was driven by the increase in commercial lending as a result of growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans, primarily from new customers and organic growth. the increase in consumer lending resulted from growth in automobile and home equity loans, partially offset by paydowns of education loans.
average total loans increased by $13.4 billion to $190.0 billion in 2013, which was driven by increases in average commercial loans of $9.4 billion, average consumer loans of $2.4 billion and average commercial real estate loans of $1.4 billion. the overall increase in loans reflected organic loan growth, primarily in our corporate & institutional banking segment.
loans represented 61% of total assets at both december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012. commercial lending
96 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k represented 60% of the loan portfolio at december 31, 2013 and 59% at december 31, 2012. consumer lending represented 40% of the loan portfolio at december 31, 2013 and 41% at december 31, 2012. commercial real estate loans represented 11% of total loans at december 31, 2013 and 10% at december 31, 2012 and represented 7% of total assets at december 31, 2013 and 6% at december 31, 2012.
the total loan balances above included purchased impaired loans of $6.1 billion, or 3% of total loans, at december 31, 2013, and $7.4 billion, or 4% of total loans, at december 31, 2012.
investment securities as of december 31, 2013, the amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities totaled $48.0 billion and $48.6 billion, respectively, compared to an amortized cost and fair value as of december 31, 2012 of $49.4 billion and $51.1 billion, respectively. the amortized cost and fair value of held to maturity securities were $11.7 billion and $11.8 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2013, compared to $10.4 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2012. investment securities represented 19% of total assets at december 31, 2013 and 20% at december 31, 2012. average investment securities decreased to $57.3 billion during 2013 compared to $60.8 billion during 2012.
the fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. the fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. in addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and vice versa. net unrealized gains in the total investment securities portfolio decreased to $.7 billion at december 31, 2013 from $2.1 billion at december 31, 2012 due primarily to an increase in market interest rates. the comparable amounts for the securities available for sale portfolio were $.6 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.
during 2013, we transferred securities with a fair value of $1.9 billion from available for sale to held to maturity. we changed our intent and committed to hold these high-quality securities to maturity in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on accumulated other comprehensive income and certain capital measures, taking into consideration market conditions and changes to regulatory capital requirements under basel iii capital standards.
the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio (excluding corporate stocks and other) was 4.9 years at december 31, 2013 and 4.0 years at december 31, 2012.
loans held for sale loans held for sale totaled $2.3 billion at december 31, 2013 compared with $3.7 billion at december 31, 2012.
for commercial mortgages held for sale designated at fair value, the balance relating to these loans was $586 million at december 31, 2013 compared to $772 million at december 31, 2012. for commercial mortgages held for sale carried at lower of cost or fair value, we sold $2.8 billion in 2013 compared to $2.2 billion in 2012. all of these loan sales were to government agencies. total gains of $79 million were recognized on the valuation and sale of commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, in 2013, and $41 million in 2012.
residential mortgage loan origination volume was $15.1 billion in 2013 compared to $15.2 billion in 2012. substantially all such loans were originated under agency or federal housing administration (fha) standards. we sold $14.7 billion of loans and recognized related gains of $568 million in 2013. the comparable amounts for 2012 were $13.8 billion and $747 million, respectively.
asset quality overall credit quality continued to improve during 2013. nonperforming assets decreased $.3 billion, or 9%, to $3.5 billion at december 31, 2013 compared to december 31, 2012. nonperforming assets to total assets were 1.08% at december 31, 2013, compared to 1.24% at december 31, 2012. overall delinquencies of $2.5 billion decreased $1.3 billion, or 33%, compared with december 31, 2012. net charge-offs of $1.1 billion in 2013 were down 16% compared to net charge-offs of $1.3 billion in 2012. net charge-offs were 0.57% of average loans in 2013 and 0.73% of average loans in 2012.
the alll was $3.6 billion, or 1.84% of total loans and 117% of nonperforming loans, as of december 31, 2013, compared to $4.0 billion, or 2.17% of total loans and 124% of nonperforming loans, as of december 31, 2012.
at december 31, 2013, our largest nonperforming asset was $36 million in the real estate, rental and leasing industry and our average nonperforming loans associated with commercial lending were under $1 million.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $11.3 billion at december 31, 2013 and $10.9 billion at december 31, 2012. the increase of $.4 billion was primarily due to additions to and changes in value of mortgage and other loan servicing rights.

funding sources total funding sources increased $13.0 billion to $267.0 billion at december 31, 2013 compared with december 31, 2012.
total deposits increased $7.8 billion at december 31, 2013 compared with december 31, 2012 due to increases in money market, demand, and savings accounts, partially offset by decreases in retail certificates of deposit. interest-bearing deposits represented 68% of total deposits at december 31, 2013 compared to 67% at december 31, 2012
average total deposits increased $10.6 billion to $212.2 billion in 2013 compared with the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $15.0 billion in average transaction deposits, which grew to $176.9 billion in 2013. higher average interest-bearing demand deposits, average money market deposits and average noninterest-bearing deposits drove the increase in average transaction deposits. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of $4.3 billion in average retail certificates of deposit attributable to runoff of maturing accounts. average total deposits represented 69% of average total assets for 2013 and 68% for 2012.
total borrowed funds increased $5.2 billion to $46.1 billion at december 31, 2013 as higher federal home loan bank borrowings and bank notes and senior debt were partially offset by a decrease in commercial paper.
average borrowed funds were $40.0 billion in 2013 compared with $41.8 billion in 2012. the decrease was primarily due to lower average commercial paper, lower average federal home loan bank (fhlb) borrowings and lower average federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements.
shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased $3.4 billion, to $42.3 billion at december 31, 2013 compared with december 31, 2012, primarily reflecting an increase in retained earnings of $3.0 billion (driven by net income of $4.2 billion and the impact of $1.1 billion of common and preferred dividends declared) and an increase of $.6 billion in capital surplus due to the net issuances of preferred stock and common stock and other. these increases were partially offset by the decline of accumulated other comprehensive income of $.4 billion. this decline was primarily due to the impact of an increase in market interest rates and widening asset spreads on securities available for sale and derivatives that are part of cash flow hedging strategies, partially offset by the impact of pension and other postretirement benefit plan adjustments. common shares outstanding were 533 million at december 31, 2013 and 528 million at december 31, 2012.
risk-based capital regulatory basel i capital ratios at december 31, 2013 were 10.5% for tier 1 common, 11.1% for leverage, 12.4% for tier 1 risk-based and 15.8% for total risk-based capital. at december 31, 2012, the basel i regulatory capital ratios were 9.6% for tier 1 common, 10.4% for leverage, 11.6% for tier 1 risk-based and 14.7% for total risk-based capital. the basel i capital ratios increased in all comparisons primarily due to growth in retained earnings. the net issuance of preferred stock during 2013 partially offset by the redemption of trust preferred securities favorably impacted the december 31, 2013 basel i tier 1 risk-based and basel i total risk-based capital ratios. basel i risk-weighted assets increased $11.3 billion to $272.2 billion at december 31, 2013 compared to december 31, 2012.

notional amount  a number of currency units, shares, or other units specified in a derivative contract.
operating leverage  the period to period dollar or percentage change in total revenue (gaap basis) less the dollar or percentage change in noninterest expense. a positive variance indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth (i.e., positive operating leverage) while a negative variance implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth (i.e., negative operating leverage).

other-than-temporary impairment (otti)  when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost basis, an assessment is performed to determine whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. if we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred. in such cases, an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investments amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. further, if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred. however for debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its recovery, the other-than-temporary loss is separated into (a) the amount representing the credit loss, and (b) the amount related to all other factors. the other-than-temporary impairment related to credit losses is recognized in earnings while the amount related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax.
parent company liquidity coverage  liquid assets divided by funding obligations within a two year period.
pretax earnings  income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests.

taxable-equivalent interest  the interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. as such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. to provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest-earning assets, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on other taxable investments. this adjustment is not permitted under gaap on the consolidated income statement.
total equity  total shareholders equity plus noncontrolling interests.
total return swap  a non-traditional swap where one party agrees to pay the other the total return of a defined underlying asset (e.g., a loan), usually in return for receiving a stream of libor-based cash flows. the total returns of the asset, including interest and any default shortfall, are passed through to the counterparty. the counterparty is, therefore, assuming the credit and economic risk of the underlying asset.

                                                     our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than we are currently expecting. these statements are based on our current view that the u.s. economic expansion will speed up to an above trend growth rate near 3.5 percent in 2015, boosted by lower oil/energy prices, and that short-term interest rates and bond yields will rise only slowly in the latter half of 2015. these forward-looking statements also do not, unless otherwise indicated, take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies.

                                                    pncs ability to take certain capital actions, including paying dividends and any plans to increase common stock dividends, repurchase common stock under current or future programs, or issue or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments, is subject to the review of such proposed actions by the federal reserve as part of pncs comprehensive capital plan for the applicable period in connection with the regulators comprehensive capital analysis and review (ccar) process and to the acceptance of such capital plan and non-objection to such capital actions by the federal reserve.

                                              pncs regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the companys financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect (particularly those implementing the basel capital accords), and management actions affecting the composition of pncs balance sheet. in addition, pncs ability to determine, evaluate and

the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k 103
forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory approval of related models.

                                                      legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain management. these developments could include:

                                                   changes resulting from legislative and regulatory reforms, including major reform of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry and changes to laws and regulations involving tax, pension, bankruptcy, consumer protection, and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles. we will be impacted by extensive reforms provided for in the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the dodd-frank act) and otherwise growing out of the most recent financial crisis, the precise nature, extent and timing of which, and their impact on us, remains uncertain.

   changes to regulations governing bank capital and liquidity standards, including due to the dodd-frank act and to basel-related initiatives.

                                                     unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. in addition to matters relating to pncs current and historical business and activities, such matters may include proceedings, claims, investigations, or inquiries relating to pre-acquisition business and activities of acquired companies, such as national city. these matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to pnc.

   results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.

   impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general.

                                                    business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards. in particular, our results currently depend on our ability to manage elevated levels of impaired assets.

   business and operating results also include impacts relating to our equity interest in blackrock, inc. and rely to a significant extent on information provided to us by blackrock. risks and uncertainties that could affect blackrock are discussed in more detail by blackrock in its sec filings.

                                                       we grow our business in part by acquiring from time to time other financial services companies, financial services assets and related deposits and other liabilities. acquisition risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, and the integration of the acquired businesses into pnc after closing.

                                                    competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. industry restructuring in the current environment could also impact our business and financial performance through changes in counterparty creditworthiness and performance and in the competitive and regulatory landscape. our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.

       business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist activities, cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically.

we provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors elsewhere in this report, including in the risk factors and risk management sections and the legal proceedings and commitments and guarantees notes of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report. our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the sec.

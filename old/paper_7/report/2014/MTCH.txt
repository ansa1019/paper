item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview iac is a leading media and internet company. the company is organized into four segments: the match group, which consists of dating, education and fitness businesses with brands such as match, okcupid, tinder, the princeton review and dailyburn; search & applications, which includes brands such as about.com, ask.com, dictionary.com and investopedia; media, which includes businesses such as vimeo, electus, the daily beast and collegehumor; and ecommerce, which includes homeadvisor and shoebuy. iac's brands and products are among the most recognized in the world, reaching users in over 200 countries.
sources of revenue substantially all of the revenue from our search & applications segment is derived from online advertising. this revenue is primarily attributable to our services agreement with google inc. ("google"), which expires on march 31, 2016. our services agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google. subject to certain limitations, google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines, which could require modification to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, revenue earned from google was $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.
the revenue earned from the match group segment is derived from dating and non-dating services. dating revenue is principally earned from subscription fees for our subscription-based online personals and related services; with additional revenue generated from online advertising. non-dating revenue is primarily earned from fees received for in-person and online test preparation classes, access to online test preparation materials and individual tutoring services. the revenue earned by our media segment is derived from media production, subscriptions and advertising. homeadvisor's revenue is derived primarily from fees paid by members of its network of home services professionals for consumer leads and subscription sales to service professionals. shoebuy's revenue is derived principally from merchandise sales.
strategic partnerships, advertiser relationships and online advertising a significant component of the company's revenue is attributable to the services agreement with google described above. we market and offer our products and services directly to consumers through branded websites and subscriptions, allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner. we have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses.
we pay traffic acquisition costs, which consist of payments to partners who distribute our b2b customized browser-based applications, integrate our paid listings into their websites or direct traffic to our websites. we also pay to market and distribute our services on third-party distribution channels, such as search engines and internet portals. in addition, some of our businesses manage affiliate programs, pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned. these distribution channels might also offer their own products and services, as well as those of other third parties, which compete with those we offer.
the cost of acquiring new consumers through online and offline third-party distribution channels has increased, particularly in the case of online channels as internet commerce continues to grow and competition in the markets in which iac's businesses operate increases.
factors affecting results in 2014, we delivered 3% revenue growth; however, adjusted ebitda and operating income declined 9% and 11%, respectively. revenue growth was primarily driven by the match group segment, while the declines in adjusted ebitda and operating income were primarily driven by the search & applications and media segments. revenue from the match group segment benefited from increased subscribers and the contributions from the princeton review, which was acquired august 1, 2014, and friendscout24, which was acquired august 31, 2014. the results of our search & applications segment were negatively impacted by decreased revenue from our applications business, which was principally due to lower queries from our b2b operations. the search & applications adjusted ebitda was negatively impacted by the loss from slimware, which was acquired april 1, 2014, due to the write-off of $11.0 million of deferred revenue in connection with its acquisition, partially offset by the positive contribution of valueclick's "owned & operated" ("o&o") website businesses, which was acquired january 10, 2014. within the media segment, additional investment in vimeo increased its revenue and losses; this revenue increase was more than offset by the lower revenue and increased losses at the daily beast following its sale of newsweek in august 2013, which generated a $6.3 million gain.
other events affecting year-over-year comparability include:
24
(i)   a $3.9 million benefit in 2014 related to the expiration of the statute of limitations for a non-income tax matter (reflected in the match group segment);
(ii)   the sale of the rezbook assets in july 2013, which resulted in a gain of $8.4 million (reflected in the ecommerce segment);
(iii)   the move of citygrid from the ecommerce segment to the search &amp; applications segment, effective july 1, 2013, following its reorganization; and
(iv)   $4.2 million in employee termination costs associated with the citygrid restructuring in 2013 (reflected in the ecommerce segment).

for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013
search & applications revenue decreased 1% to $1.6 billion reflecting a decline from applications (which includes our direct-to-consumer downloadable applications operations (b2c), our partnership operations (b2b), slimware and apalon), partially offset by an increase from websites (which is principally composed of ask.com, about.com, citygrid, dictionary.com, investopedia, pricerunner.com and ask.fm). applications revenue decreased 7% to $760.5 million, despite strong query growth from our b2c operations and the contribution of slimware, which was acquired on april 1, 2014, primarily due to lower queries from our b2b operations. websites revenue grew 6% to $835.8 million driven by the acquisition of the valueclick o&o website businesses on january 10, 2014, growth from about.com and the contribution of citygrid, which had been moved from the ecommerce segment to the search & applications segment, effective july 1, 2013, following its reorganization, partially offset by a decline in revenue from ask.com.
the match group revenue increased 11% to $897.2 million driven by a 6% increase in dating revenue. dating north america revenue (which includes match, chemistry, people media, okcupid, tinder and other dating businesses operating within the united states and canada) and dating international revenue (which includes meetic, tinder and all other dating businesses operating outside of the united states and canada) both increased 6% to $557.2 million and $279.3 million, respectively. these businesses are collectively referred to as "dating." the growth in dating revenue was driven by increased paid subscribers. north america and international paid subscribers increased 5% and 4%, respectively. non-dating revenue (consisting of the princeton review, tutor.com and dailyburn) increased 254% principally due to the contribution of the princeton review, which was acquired on august 1, 2014.
media revenue decreased 5% to $181.8 million primarily due to the impact of the closure of the newsweek print business and sale of the newsweek digital business in august 2013 and declines at electus, partially offset by strong growth at vimeo and the contribution in the current year of $11.3 million from iac films.
ecommerce revenue increased 3% to $435.4 million due to growth at homeadvisor and shoebuy, partially offset by the move of citygrid described above. the increase in revenue from homeadvisor is driven by an increase in domestic service requests and accepts of 13% and 9%, respectively.
for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the year ended december 31, 2012
search & applications revenue increased 9% to $1.6 billion, reflecting strong growth from websites and applications. websites revenue grew 11% to $786.9 million, reflecting the contribution from the about group, acquired

media revenue increased 17% to $191.4 million primarily due to strong growth from electus and vimeo.
ecommerce revenue decreased 8% to $422.1 million due to the move of citygrid described above, partially offset by increased sales at homeadvisor and shoebuy.

search & applications adjusted ebitda decreased 6% to $362.0 million, primarily due to the lower revenue noted above, increases in selling and marketing expense and general and administrative expense and losses related to the acquisition of slimware, partially offset by the move of citygrid from the ecommerce segment to the search & applications segment, a decrease in cost of revenue and the contribution from the acquisition of the valueclick o&o website businesses. the loss from slimware was due to the write-off of $11.0 million of deferred revenue in connection with its acquisition on april 1, 2014. the increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to an increase in online marketing related to our b2c downloadable applications and about.com. the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to increases in compensation and professional fees. the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to a decrease in traffic acquisition costs driven from lower revenue from our b2b operations.
the match group adjusted ebitda decreased 1% to $264.7 million despite higher revenue noted above, primarily due to losses related to the princeton review and friendscout24 acquisitions and higher cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense and general and administrative expense. the losses from the princeton review and friendscout24 were due to the write-off of $11.8 million of deferred revenue in connection with these acquisitions. the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to increases in revenue share payments made in connection with in-app purchases sold through dating's mobile products and hosting fees. the increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to an increase in offline and online marketing. the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in compensation, partially

offset by a $3.9 million benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2014 related to the expiration of the statute of limitations for a non-income tax matter.
media adjusted ebitda loss increased 116% to a loss of $36.7 million primarily due to increased investment in vimeo, the inclusion in the prior year of a $6.3 million gain related to the sale of newsweek in august 2013 and losses at iac films, partially offset by lower losses at electus.
ecommerce adjusted ebitda decreased 25% to $17.3 million primarily due to the prior year benefiting from an $8.4 million gain on the sale of rezbook assets in july 2013 and the move of citygrid to the search & applications segment, partially offset by $4.2 million in employee termination costs in 2013 associated with the citygrid restructuring.
corporate adjusted ebitda loss increased 5% to a loss of $63.3 million primarily due to higher professional fees.
for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the year ended december 31, 2012
search & applications adjusted ebitda increased 18% to $385.9 million, due to the higher revenue noted above, partially offset by increases of $42.7 million in selling and marketing expense, $16.3 million in product development expense, $12.4 million in general and administrative expense and $10.1 million in cost of revenue. the increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to b2c downloadable applications and the inclusion of the about group, beginning september 24, 2012. the increase in both product development expense and general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in compensation related to the inclusion of the about group. product development expense was also impacted by an increase in headcount related to b2c products. the increase in costs of revenue was primarily due to an increase in content acquisition costs resulting from the acquisition of the about group and the inclusion of citygrid in the search & applications segment, partially offset by a decrease of $7.7 million in traffic acquisition costs driven primarily by decreased revenue from ask.com.
the match group adjusted ebitda increased 13% to $266.9 million, due to the revenue growth noted above, partially offset by increases of $21.2 million in selling and marketing expense, $20.4 million in general and administrative expense, $12.7 million in cost of revenue and $5.3 million in product development expense. the increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to increases in television advertising and compensation due, in part, to an increase in headcount at meetic and various acquisitions. the increases in general and administrative expense, cost of revenue and product development expense were primarily due to various acquisitions. general and administrative expense was also impacted by an increase in compensation of $5.6 million at dating, resulting from an increase in headcount and higher professional fees primarily due to transaction fees related to the meetic tender offer.
media adjusted ebitda loss decreased 56% to a loss of $17.0 million primarily due to the closure of the newsweek print business and the inclusion of a $6.3 million gain related to the sale of newsweek in august 2013.
ecommerce adjusted ebitda decreased 27% to $22.9 million reflecting the move of citygrid to the search & applications segment and $4.2 million in employee termination costs associated with the citygrid reorganization that took place in the second quarter of 2013. partially offsetting the decrease in adjusted ebitda was the inclusion of an $8.4 million gain on the sale of the rezbook assets in july 2013.

operating income in 2014 decreased from 2013 due to the decrease of $54.2 million in adjusted ebitda described above and increases of $6.6 million in non-cash compensation expense and $2.2 million in depreciation, partially offset by decreases of $13.7 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments and $1.9 million in amortization of intangibles. the increase in non-cash compensation expense was primarily due to the issuance of equity awards since the prior year. the decrease in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments was principally related to changes in twoo's forecast of earnings and operating metrics. the decrease in amortization of intangibles was primarily related to lower amortization expense at dating due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized, and the inclusion in the prior year of a $3.4 million impairment charge associated with an indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the citygrid  restructuring, partially offset by amortization of intangibles related to recent acquisitions.
at december 31, 2014, there was $113.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.4 years.
for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the year ended december 31, 2012
operating income in 2013 increased from 2012 due to the increase of $100.9 million in adjusted ebitda described above and a decrease of $32.6 million in non-cash compensation expense, partially offset by increases of $24.1 million in amortization of intangibles and $6.4 million in depreciation. the decrease in non-cash compensation expense was primarily a result of the vesting of certain awards and an increase in the number of awards forfeited as compared to the prior year. the increase in amortization of intangibles was primarily related to the acquisition of the about group and a $3.4 million impairment charge associated with an indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the citygrid restructuring in the second quarter of 2013.

equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates in 2014 increased from 2013 primarily due to the inclusion in the second quarter of 2014 of a $4.2 million other-than-temporary impairment charge on one of our investments following the sale of a majority of the investee's assets, partially offset by reduced losses associated with our equity method investments.
equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates in 2013 decreased from 2012 due to the inclusion in 2012 of a non-cash charge of $18.6 million related to the re-measurement of the carrying value of our equity method investment in the daily beast to fair value in connection with our acquisition of a controlling interest.

in 2014, the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of $35.4 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 13%. the effective rate is lower than the statutory rate of 35% due principally to a reduction in tax reserves and related interest due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for federal income taxes for 2001 through 2009 of $88.2 million and foreign income taxed at lower rates, partially offset by the largely unbenefited loss associated with the write-downs of certain of the company's investments and non-deductible goodwill associated with the sale of urbanspoon. in 2013, the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of $134.5 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 32%. the effective rate is lower than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to foreign income taxed at lower rates. in 2012, the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of $119.2 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 41%. the effective rate is higher than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to an increase in reserves for and interest on reserves for income tax contingencies, a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset created by an other-than-temporary impairment charge and state taxes, partially offset by foreign income taxed at lower rates.
the company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. included in the income tax provision for continuing operations and discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 is a $58.5 million and a $19.7 million benefit, respectively, net of related deferred taxes, from the decrease in interest on unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations described above. included in the
32
income tax provision for continuing operations and discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2013 is a $4.8 million expense and a $1.4 million expense, respectively, net of related deferred taxes, for interest on unrecognized tax benefits. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the company has accrued $2.8 million and $133.0 million, respectively, for the payment of interest. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the company has accrued $2.9 million and $5.1 million, respectively, for penalties.
the company is routinely under audit by federal, state, local and foreign authorities in the area of income tax. these audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions. the internal revenue service is currently auditing the company's federal income tax returns for the years ended december 31, 2010 through 2012. various other jurisdictions are open to examination for various tax years beginning with 2006. income taxes payable include reserves considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns. changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon the resolution of audits and amounts previously provided may be material. differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the company are recorded in the period they become known.
the statutes of limitations for federal income taxes for the years 2001 through 2009 expired on july 1, 2014. as a result, previously unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, totaling $374.8 million were recognized in the third quarter of 2014. the income tax benefit to continuing operations and discontinued operations was $88.2 million and $175.7 million, respectively. the remaining amount of $110.9 million impacted various balance sheet accounts, primarily non-current deferred tax assets, which were reduced by $100.1 million. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the company has unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, of $33.2 million and $408.8 million, respectively. if unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2014 are subsequently recognized, $30.5 million, net of related deferred tax assets and interest, would reduce income tax provision for continuing operations. the company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $8.8 million within twelve months of the current reporting date primarily due to expirations of statutes of limitations; $8.4 million of which would reduce the income tax provision for continuing operations.

net cash provided by operating activities attributable to continuing operations in 2013 consists of earnings from continuing operations of $281.8 million, adjustments for non-cash items and gains on sales of long-term investments and assets totaling $110.8 million, and an increase from working capital activities of $18.4 million. adjustments for non-cash items and gains on sales of long-term investments and assets primarily consist of $59.8 million of amortization of intangibles, $58.9 million of depreciation and $53.0 million of non-cash compensation expense, partially offset by a $50.6 million adjustment related to gains on sales of long-term investments and assets and $32.9 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based awards. the changes from working capital activities consist of an increase in income taxes payable of $49.2 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $10.4 million, partially offset by an increase of $34.6 million in other assets. the increase in income taxes payable is due to current year income tax accruals in excess of current year income tax payments. the decrease in accounts receivable is primarily due to a $14.8 million decrease in accounts receivable related to newsweek's transition to a digital only publication and our services agreement with google; the related receivable from google declined from $125.3 million at december 31, 2012 to $112.3 million at december 31, 2013, mainly due to lower year-over-year december revenue. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable at electus due to higher revenue. the increase in other assets is primarily due to an increase in short-term and long-term production costs at certain of our media businesses that are capitalized as the television program, video or film is being produced.
net cash used in investing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2013 includes acquisitions of $40.4 million, which include twoo, capital expenditures of $80.3 million, which include $23.6 million related to the purchase of a 50% ownership interest in an aircraft and investments of $51.1 million, partially offset by net maturities and sales of marketable debt securities and sales of long-term investments and assets of $95.6 million.
net cash provided by financing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2013 includes $500.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of our 2013 senior notes and excess tax benefits from stock-based awards of $32.9 million, partially offset by $264.2 million for the repurchase of 4.5 million shares of common stock at an average price of $50.63 per share, $79.2 million related to the payment of cash dividends to iac shareholders, $71.5 million held in escrow related to the meetic tender offer, $67.9 million for the purchase of noncontrolling interests in meetic and a subsidiary of homeadvisor, $15.8 million for the payment of our 2002 senior notes, which were due january 15, 2013, and $7.4 million of debt issuance costs associated with our 2013 senior notes.
net cash provided by operating activities attributable to continuing operations in 2012 consists of earnings from continuing operations of $169.8 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $204.2 million, partially offset by a decrease from working capital activities of $19.5 million. adjustments for non-cash items primarily consists of $85.6 million of non-cash compensation expense, $52.5 million of depreciation, $37.1 million of deferred income taxes, $35.8 million of amortization of intangibles and $25.3 million of equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates, which includes a non-cash charge of $18.6 million to re-measure the carrying value of our investment in the daily beast to fair value in connection with our acquisition of a controlling interest, partially offset by $57.1 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based awards. the deferred income tax provision primarily relates to the vesting of restricted stock units, the exercise of stock options and the accelerated payment of 2012 bonuses. the changes from working capital activities primarily consist of an increase of $31.0 million in accounts receivable, an increase of $23.0 million in other assets, a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $14.4 million, partially offset by an increase in income taxes payable of $47.0 million. the increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to the growth in revenue at search & applications earned from our services agreement with google; the related receivable from google was $125.3 million and $105.7 million at december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. while the match group and homeadvisor businesses experienced growth, the accounts receivable at these businesses are principally credit card receivables and, accordingly, are not significant in relation to the revenue of these businesses. the increase in other assets is primarily related to a receivable for insurance claims related to hurricane sandy, an increase in capitalized downloadable search toolbar costs and an increase in short-term production costs at certain of our media businesses that are capitalized as the television program, video or film is being produced. the decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities is primarily due to a decrease in accrued employee compensation and benefits, partially offset by an increase in accrued advertising expense. the decrease in accrued employee compensation and benefits is due to the payment of the 2012 and 2011 bonuses in 2012. the increase in accrued advertising expense is primarily due to an increase in advertising expenditures at search & applications. the increase in income taxes payable is due to current year income tax accruals in excess of current year income tax payments.
net cash used in investing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2012 includes acquisitions of $400.3 million, primarily related to the about group, capital expenditures of $51.2 million primarily related to the internal development of software to support our products and services and investments of $36.1 million, partially offset by net maturities and sales of marketable debt securities and sales of long-term investments and assets of $156.2 million.
net cash provided by financing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2012 includes $500.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of our 2012 senior notes, proceeds related to the issuance of common stock, net of withholding taxes, of $262.8 million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based awards of $57.1 million, partially offset by $691.8 million

for the repurchase of 15.5 million shares of common stock at an average price of $46.09 per share, $68.2 million related to the payment of cash dividends to iac shareholders, $11.0 million of debt issuance costs associated with our 2012 senior notes and $10.8 million in contingent consideration payments principally related to the 2011 okcupid acquisition. included in the proceeds related to the issuance of common stock are proceeds of $284.1 million from the exercise of warrants to acquire 11.7 million shares of iac common stock, some of which were exercised on a cashless or net basis. the weighted average strike price of the warrants was $28.40 per share.
the company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as its cash flows generated from operations. the company has a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, which expires on december 21, 2017, and is available as an additional source of financing. at december 31, 2014, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
the company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations. the company expects that 2015 capital expenditures will be higher than 2014. at december 31, 2014, iac had 8.6 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization. iac may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors iac management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook. on february 3, 2015, iac declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 per share of common and class b common stock outstanding payable on march 1, 2015 to stockholders of record on february 15, 2015. future declarations of dividends are subject to the determination of iac's board of directors.
the company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with its expected positive cash flows generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under its $300.0 million revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to fund its normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, share repurchases, quarterly cash dividends, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future. our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. the company may make acquisitions and investments that could reduce its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and as a result, the company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater financial flexibility. additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us. the indentures governing the 2013 and 2012 senior notes restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the event we are not in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. in addition, the terms of the revolving credit facility require that we maintain a leverage ratio of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. as of december 31, 2014, the company was in compliance with all of these covenants.

iac's principles of financial reporting iac reports adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. we believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. this non-gaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results. iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-gaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-gaap measure. we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and non-gaap measure, which we discuss below.
definition of iac's non-gaap measure adjusted ebitda is defined as operating income excluding: (1) non-cash compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairments and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements. we believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to iac's statement of operations of certain expenses.
non-cash expenses that are excluded from iac's non-gaap measure non-cash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions, of stock options, restricted stock units ("rsus") and performance-based rsus. these expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury method; however, performance-based rsus are included only to the extent the performance criteria have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of rsus and performance-based rsus, the awards are settled, at the company's discretion, on a net basis, with the company remitting the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.
depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives.
amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairments are non-cash expenses relating primarily to acquisitions. at the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as content, technology, customer lists, advertiser and supplier relationships, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. while it is likely that we will have significant intangible amortization expense as we continue to acquire companies, we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value. these adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or ongoing costs of doing business.

critical accounting policies and estimates the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iac's accounting policies contained in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment. management of the company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. these estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ from those estimates. because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others. what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
business combinations the purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. the fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. the excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill.
in connection with some business combinations, the company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price. each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled. the contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics. the company generally determines the fair value of contingent consideration using probability-weighted analyses over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled, and, to the extent the arrangement is long-term in nature, applies a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation. significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. determining fair value is inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. the changes in the remeasured fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements each reporting period are recognized in "general and administrative expense" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. see note 7 for a discussion of contingent consideration arrangements.
recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the company's acquired trade names and trademarks, are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. the 2014, 2013 and 2012 annual assessments identified no material impairments. the value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is $1.8 billion and $405.2 million, respectively, at december 31, 2014.
the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if the company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of that reporting unit's goodwill is necessary; otherwise goodwill must be tested for impairment using a two-step process. the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill. in performing the first step, the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("dcf") and a market approach based on multiples of earnings. determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the company's most recent budget and, for years beyond the budget, the company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. assumptions used in the dcf analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed annually based on the reporting units' current results and forecast, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. the discount rates used in the company's annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 13% to 19% in 2014 and 13% to 25% in 2013. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed. the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment, if any. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. in other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired
40
in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
any impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based upon the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value using the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above but, in any event, would not be expected to be lower than the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value. a primary driver in the dcf valuation analyses and the determination of the fair values of the company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability. generally, the company would expect an impairment if forecasted revenue and profitability are no longer expected to be achieved and as a result, the carrying value of a reporting unit(s) exceeds its fair value. this assessment would be based, in part, upon the performance of its businesses relative to budget, the company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
at october 1, 2014, the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment, the fair value of the company's reporting units exceed their carrying values. the fair value of the search & applications reporting unit currently exceeds its carrying value by approximately 15%. if operating results vary significantly from anticipated results, future, potentially material, impairments of goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets could occur. to illustrate the magnitude of a potential impairment charge relative to future changes in estimated fair value, had the estimated fair value of search & applications been hypothetically lower by 20% as of october 1, 2014, the carrying value of search & applications would have exceeded its fair value by approximately $100 million.
the company also has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. if the company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, the fair value of the asset does not need to be determined; otherwise the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset must be determined and compared to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. the estimates of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the company's trade names and trademarks. assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. the discount rates used in the company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 10% to 20% in 2014 and 10% to 18% in 2013, and the royalty rates used ranged from 1% to 9% in both 2014 and 2013.
recoverability of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. during 2013 the company wrote off certain capitalized software costs. this charge is more fully described above in "results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 - depreciation." the carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $389.2 million at december 31, 2014.
income taxes we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. at december 31, 2014, the company has unrecognized tax benefits of $33.2 million, including interest. changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material. differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the company are recorded in the period they become known.
41
the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. as of december 31, 2014, the balance of deferred tax liabilities, net, is $390.4 million. actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
stock-based compensation as disclosed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2014, 2013 and 2012 using a black-scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 1.5%, 1.0% and 0.6%, respectively, a dividend yield of 1.5%, 2.0% and 1.2%, respectively, volatility factors of 31%, 29% and 31%, respectively, based on the historical stock price volatilities of iac and a weighted average expected term of the stock options of 4.8 years, 6.2 years and 4.4 years, respectively. for stock options, including unvested stock options assumed in acquisitions, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date (or acquisition date, if applicable) at fair value and expensed over the remaining vesting term. the impact on non-cash compensation expense for the year ended december 31, 2014, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $2.5 million, $11.9 million and $5.1 million, respectively. the impact on non-cash compensation expense for the year ended december 31, 2014, assuming a 1% increase in the dividend yield of the outstanding options, would be a decrease of $1.1 million. the company also issues rsus and performance-based rsus. for rsus issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation expense over the vesting term. for performance-based rsus issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
marketable securities and long-term investments at december 31, 2014, marketable securities consist of short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers and an equity security. long-term investments include equity securities accounted for under the equity and cost methods and marketable equity securities. the company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. the company also invests in marketable equity securities as part of its investment strategy.
marketable securities are adjusted to fair value each quarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders' equity. the specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings. the company recognizes unrealized losses on marketable securities in net earnings when the losses are determined to be other-than-temporary. additionally, the company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis, and recognizes an impairment loss if the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary. future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the company's investments to decline.
the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments. investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations. during 2014 and 2013, the company recognized impairment charges of $66.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively, related to cost method investments and during 2012, the company recorded an impairment charge of $8.7 million related to one of its long-term marketable equity securities. these charges are more fully described above in "results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 - other (expense) income, net."

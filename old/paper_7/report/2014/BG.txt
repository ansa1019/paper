item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with "cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements" and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.
operating results factors affecting operating results bunge limited, a bermuda company, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global agribusiness and food company operating in the farm-to-consumer food chain. the commodity nature of the company's principal products, as well as regional and global supply and demand variations that occur as an inherent part of the business make volumes an important operating measure. accordingly, information is included in "segment results" that summarizes certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment. the unit of measure for all reported volumes is metric tons, a common unit of measure within our industry. a description of reported volumes for each reportable segment has also been included in the discussion of key factors affecting results of operations in each of our business segments as discussed below.
33
agribusiness in the agribusiness segment, we purchase, store, transport, process and sell agricultural commodities and commodity products. profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and market prices of agricultural commodities and processed commodity products and the availability and costs of energy, transportation and logistics services. profitability in our oilseed processing operations is also impacted by volumes procured, processed and sold and by capacity utilization rates. availability of agricultural commodities is affected by many factors, including weather, farmer planting decisions, plant disease, governmental policies and agricultural sector economic conditions. reported volumes in this segment primarily reflect (i) grains and oilseeds originated from farmers, cooperatives or other aggregators and from which "origination margins" are earned; (ii) oilseeds processed in our oilseed processing facilities and from which "crushing margins" are earnedrepresenting the margin resulting from the industrial separation of the oilseed into its protein meal and vegetable oil components, both of which components are separate commodity products themselves; and (iii) third party sales of grains, oilseeds and related commodity products merchandised through our distribution businesses and from which "distribution margins" are earned. the foregoing sub-segment volumes may overlap as they produce separate margin capture opportunities. for example, oilseeds procured in our south american grain origination activities may be processed in our oilseed processing facilities in asia-pacific and will be reflected at both points within the segment. as such, these reported volumes do not represent solely volumes of net sales to third-parties, but rather where margin is earned, appropriately reflecting their contribution to our global network's capacity utilization and profitability.
demand for our purchased and processed agribusiness products is affected by many factors, including global and regional economic conditions, changes in per capita incomes, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, particularly pork and poultry, population growth rates, relative prices of substitute agricultural products, outbreaks of disease associated with livestock and poultry, and demand for renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities and commodity products.
we expect that the factors described above will continue to affect global supply and demand for our agribusiness products for the foreseeable future. we also expect that, from time to time, imbalances will likely exist between oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products in certain regions, which impacts our decisions regarding whether, when and where to purchase, store, transport, process or sell these commodities, including whether to change the location of or adjust our own oilseed processing capacity.
food and ingredients in the food and ingredients business, which consists of our edible oil products and milling products segments, our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials, such as crude vegetable oils and grains, the mix of products that we sell, changes in consumer eating habits, changes in per capita incomes, consumer purchasing power levels, availability of credit to customers, governmental dietary guidelines and policies, changes in regional economic conditions and the general competitive environment in our markets. raw material inputs to our production processes in the edible oil products segment and the milling products segment are largely sourced at market prices from our agribusiness segment. reported volumes in these segments reflect third-party sales of our finished products and, as such, include the sales of products derived from raw materials sourced from the agribusiness segment as well as from third-parties. the unit of measure for these volumes is metric tons as these businesses are linked to the commodity raw materials which are their primary inputs.
34
sugar and bioenergy our sugar and bioenergy segment is an integrated business which includes the procurement and growing of sugarcane and the production of sugar, ethanol and electricity in our eight mills in brazil, global sugar trading and merchandising activities and investment interests in certain corn-based ethanol producers.
profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and quality of sugarcane, which impact our capacity utilization rates and the amount of sugar that can be extracted from the sugarcane, and by market prices of sugarcane, sugar and ethanol. availability and quality of sugarcane is affected by many factors, including weather, geographical factors such as soil quality and topography, and agricultural practices. once planted, sugarcane may be harvested for several continuous years, but the usable crop decreases with each subsequent harvest. as a result, the current optimum economic cycle is generally five or six consecutive harvests, depending on location. we own and/or have partnership agreements to manage farmland on which we grow and harvest sugarcane. we also purchase sugarcane from third parties. prices of sugarcane in brazil are established by consecana, the são paulo state sugarcane and sugar and ethanol council, and are based on the sucrose content of the cane and the market prices of sugar and ethanol. demand for our products is affected by such factors as changes in global or regional economic conditions, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, population growth rates, changes in per capita incomes and demand for and governmental support of renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities, including sugarcane. we expect that these factors will continue to affect supply and demand for our sugar and bioenergy products in the foreseeable future. reported volumes in this segment reflect third-party sales of sugar and ethanol.
fertilizer in the fertilizer segment, demand for our products is affected by the profitability of the agricultural sectors we serve, the availability of credit to farmers, agricultural commodity prices, the types of crops planted, the number of acres planted, the quality of the land under cultivation and weather-related issues affecting the success of the harvests. our profitability is impacted by international selling prices for fertilizers and fertilizer raw materials, such as phosphate, sulfur, ammonia and urea, ocean freight rates and other import costs, as well as import volumes at the port facilities we manage. as our operations are in south america, primarily argentina, our results in this segment are typically seasonal, with fertilizer sales normally concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to the timing of the south american agricultural cycle. reported volumes in this segment reflect third-party sales of our finished products.
in addition to these industry related factors which impact our business areas, our results of operations in all business areas and segments are affected by the following factors:
foreign currency exchange rates due to the global nature of our operations, our operating results can be materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. both translation of our foreign subsidiaries' financial statements and foreign currency transactions can affect our results. on a monthly basis, for subsidiaries whose functional currency is their local currency, subsidiary statements of income and cash flows must be translated into u.s. dollars for consolidation purposes based on weighted-average exchange rates in each monthly period. as a result, fluctuations of local currencies compared to the u.s. dollar during each monthly period impact our consolidated statements of income and cash flows for each reported period (quarter and year-to-date) and also affect comparisons between those reported periods. subsidiary balance sheets are translated using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other
35
comprehensive income (loss). included in accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were foreign exchange net translation gains (losses) of $(1,411) million, $(1,221) million and $(805) million, respectively, resulting from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities.
additionally, we record transaction gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity. these amounts are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, with the resulting gains or losses included in the entity's statement of income and, therefore, in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains (losses).
we primarily use a combination of equity and intercompany loans to finance our subsidiaries. intercompany loans that are of a long-term investment nature with no intention of repayment in the foreseeable future are considered permanently invested and as such are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes. as a result, any foreign exchange translation gains or losses on such permanently invested intercompany loans are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets. in contrast, foreign exchange translation gains or losses on intercompany loans that are not of a permanent nature are recorded in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains (losses).
income taxes as a bermuda exempted company, we are not subject to income taxes on income in our jurisdiction of incorporation. however, our subsidiaries, which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions, are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates ranging from 0% to 39%. the jurisdictions that significantly impact our effective tax rate are brazil, the united states, argentina and bermuda. determination of taxable income requires the interpretation of related and often complex tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we operate and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events.
results of operations
2014 overview total segment ebit of $956 million in 2014 decreased from $1,329 million in 2013. ebit for 2014 was reduced by $149 million resulting from impairment and restructuring charges, primarily in our sugar and bioenergy segment. results for 2014 were also impacted by an expense of $112 million resulting from a final court ruling in brazil that certain state icms tax credits related to staple foods, including soy oil, margarine, mayonnaise and wheat flours are unconstitutional. ebit for 2013 included a gain of $63 million resulting from the sale of certain rights to legal claims in brazil, and gains of $10 million from the sales of investments in bioenergy companies in north america, offset partially by $28 million of impairment and restructuring charges in our sugar and bioenergy segment and $7 million of provisions for certain recoverable taxes in brazil.
agribusiness segment ebit of $890 million for 2014 was $142 million lower compared to $1,032 million in 2013. primary drivers of the decrease were significantly lower results in our soybean processing business in asia-pacific, including $30 million of mark-to-market losses on soybeans shipped to china at year end, lower risk management contributions in grains and lower grain trading and distribution results in both europe and asia-pacific. largely offsetting these reductions were record agribusiness results in brazil where strong export demand and margins in grains combined with well executed logistics benefitted our grain origination business and high capacity utilization in oilseed processing produced solid processing margins and volumes. in addition our north american agribusiness operations benefitted from very strong fourth quarter performance in oilseed processing in both the united states and canada, with record capacity utilization realized in some facilities. grain
36
origination activities in north america also experienced strong results, including from our operations in the pacific northwest. in europe, oilseed processing results were strong, led by our operations in spain as was our grains and oilseeds trading and distribution operations in the middle east which benefitted from strong demand.
edible oil products segment ebit decreased by $105 million to $58 million in 2014 from $163 million in 2013, primarily driven by an expense of $98 million related to certain icms tax credits in brazil. ebit for 2013 included a gain of $9 million related to the sale of our rights to certain legal claims. overall, our operational improvement and price management initiatives benefitted 2014 results. in brazil, results were more than 20% above last year with strong margins in packaged oils resulting from efficient management of raw material purchases and from our performance initiatives included price management strategies. in central europe, results improved significantly due to a higher value product mix, and operational process improvement initiatives. these gains were offset by the impact on domestic margins of significant currency depreciation in ukraine and russia. our asia-pacific operations benefitted from higher volumes and margins in our branded and bakery fats businesses in india and from operational and commercial improvement initiatives. volume growth in our argentine bottled oil and margarine businesses was driven by increased sales of refined high oleic products and neutralized oils. also export sales to bolivia, paraguay and uruguay were higher. partially offsetting these increases in results was lower ebit in north america, where lower margins in u.s. refining and canadian packaged oil operations and start-up costs of our new packaging plant in mexico more than offset savings generated from our cost improvements initiatives. these declines were partially offset by improved margins in canada refining and u.s. packaged oils.
milling products segment ebit increased to $131 million in 2014 from $125 million in 2013, primarily driven by our december 2013 acquisition of a wheat milling business in mexico, which contributed a full year of profits and additional benefits from the integration of these mills with our existing mexican wheat milling operations. wheat milling in brazil also increased results compared to 2013 with lower volumes more than offset by higher margins, primarily from price management strategies in a competitive environment with increased wheat supply. in the united states, results in corn milling were adversely impacted by a low margin environment and weaker customer demand. results were also impacted by higher energy costs early in 2014. rice milling results in the u.s. were slightly above last year, as margins improved. ebit for 2014 also included an expense of $14 million on certain icms tax credits in brazil. segment ebit in 2013 included a gain of $9 million related to the sale of our rights to certain legal claims.
sugar and bioenergy segment ebit in 2014 was a loss of $168 million compared to a loss of $60 million in 2013. results were impacted by $133 million and $28 million of impairment and restructuring charges in 2014 and 2013, respectively. our sugarcane milling business finished the year with neutral free cash flow, when adjusted for the impact of inventories varied into 2015 and machinery purchases pulled forward from 2015. cost reduction strategies on growing cane and production processes drove improved operational results, despite lower sugar prices and crush volumes. results were positively impacted by higher volumes of energy cogeneration in our mills, due to improved operational performance and additional capacity. energy margins were also higher, especially in the second half of 2014 due to drought related tight water availability for the generation of hydro-energy. our biofuels business benefitted from a robust ethanol production environment in the united states and our corn wet milling joint venture in argentina that became fully operational in 2014 contributed to results. segment ebit was negatively impacted by start-up losses in our joint venture to produce renewable oils in brazil. in our trading and distribution operations, results declined compared to 2013 as both volumes and margins were down in a low sugar price environment.
fertilizer segment ebit decreased to $45 million in 2014 compared to $69 million in 2013. ebit in 2013 included a gain of $32 million related to the sale of our rights to certain legal claims. adjusted for the 2013 gain, results were higher in 2014, primarily due to higher volumes and margins in our
37
blending and distribution business in argentina, which more than offset lower volumes and margins in our port operations in brazil.
net income attributable to bunge for 2014 was $515 million compared to $306 million for 2013. the decrease in total segment ebit of $373 million discussed above was more than offset by the significantly lower income tax expense from continuing operations ($249 million in 2014 compared with $904 million in 2013). income tax expense in 2014 included net tax benefits of $102 million that resulted primarily from the establishment of deferred tax assets related to the implementation of certain structural transfer pricing strategies in our agribusiness operations. we expect these structural changes to continue to contribute to reducing our overall effective tax rate. income tax expense for 2013 included charges of $512 million for income tax valuation allowances, primarily in our sugar milling business in brazil. net income for 2013 also included a $112 million after-tax gain on the sale of our fertilizer distribution business in brazil to yara for cash of $750 million. this gain is included in discontinued operations.
segment results bunge has five reportable segmentsagribusiness, edible oil products, milling products, sugar and bioenergy and fertilizerwhich are organized based upon similar economic characteristics and are similar in nature of products and services offered, the nature of production processes, the type and class of customer and distribution methods. the agribusiness segment is characterized by both inputs and outputs being agricultural commodities and thus high volume and low margin. the edible oil products segment involves the manufacturing and marketing of products derived from vegetable oils. the milling products segment involves the manufacturing and marketing of products derived primarily from wheat and corn. the sugar and bioenergy segment involves sugarcane growing and milling in brazil, sugar and ethanol trading and merchandising in various countries, as well as sugarcane-based ethanol production and corn-based ethanol investments and related activities. following the completion of the sale of bunge's brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets in 2010, the sale of the brazilian fertilizer blending and distribution, north american fertilizer businesses and the sale of bunge's 50% ownership interest in its joint venture in morocco in 2013, the activities of the fertilizer segment include its port operations in brazil and argentina and its blending and distribution operations in argentina.

total segment earnings before interest and tax ("ebit") is an operating performance measure used by bunge's management to evaluate its segments' operating activities. total segment ebit is a non-u.s. gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace net income attributable to bunge, the most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure. bunge's management believes segment ebit is a useful measure of its segments' operating profitability, since the measure allows for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. in addition, ebit is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in bunge's industries. total segment ebit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under u.s. gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to bunge or any other measure of consolidated operating results under u.s. gaap.
a reconciliation of total segment ebit to net income attributable to bunge follows:

2014 compared to 2013
agribusiness segmentagribusiness segment net sales decreased 8% to $42.1 billion in 2014 compared to $45.5 billion in 2013. volumes were 1% higher in the year with increased volumes of grain origination in europe resulting from good crops and harvest pace in the black sea region being offset by lower oilseeds distribution volumes in asia-pacific and processing in china and argentina. global commodity prices were generally lower in the year; especially corn prices, which declined significantly in the first nine months of the year and were on average 28% lower in 2014 compared to 2013. the impact of lower commodity prices on net sales was partly offset by the higher value mix of commodities sold in 2014 when compared with 2013.
cost of goods sold also decreased by 8% to $40.4 billion in 2014, compared with $43.7 billion last year as a result of lower average commodity prices in 2014 and lower results from trading and our risk management strategies. these reductions were only partly offset by the 1% volume increase and higher value sales mix.
gross profit was $1,742 million in 2014, 3% lower than $1,797 million a year ago, primarily as losses in our asia-pacific oilseed processing operations, mainly in china, resulting from low structural margins in the region, and reduced trading and risk management results and approximately $80 million of unrealized mark-to-market impacts related to north american processing and bunker fuel hedges at year end that are expected to reverse in 2015. these reductions more than offset good margins in north and south america, central europe and our oilseed distribution activities to the middle east.
sg&a expenses were $875 million in 2014 compared to $836 million in 2013. in 2014, sg&a expenses included costs from our new terfron port facility in northern brazil and higher employee related costs and, to a lesser extent, higher bad debt expenses. sg&a benefitted from weaker currencies when local currency costs were translated into u.s. dollars, partially offsetting the expense increases.
noncontrolling interests represent (income) loss attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders in joint venture operations that are consolidated in our financial statements. in 2014, $23 million of income compared to losses of $31 million in 2013. improved performance in our joint venture activities was primarily driven by our u.s. pacific northwest port operation and oilseed and biodiesel production ventures in europe.
segment ebit decreased to $890 million in 2014 from $1,032 million in 2013, primarily due to lower gross profit, higher sg&a and approximately $80 million of mark-to-market impacts incurred in the fourth quarter, which are expected to reverse during 2015. ebit for 2013 included a $16 million gain from the sale of certain legal claims in brazil.
edible oil products segmentedible oil products segment net sales were $8 billion in 2014 compared to $9.2 billion in 2013. the lower net sales in 2014 were primarily a result of lower average commodity prices in 2014. volumes decreased by 2% driven by rail logistics issues and soft demand from food processors in north america, and by lower retail demand and implementation of price management strategies in brazil. volumes were positively impacted in argentina by export sales of bulk oil and in asia-pacific with strong volume growth across all our brands and our bakery fats business in india.
cost of goods sold decreased 14% to $7.4 billion in 2014 from $8.6 billion in 2013, primarily due to lower raw material costs resulting from lower global commodity prices and sales volumes.
gross profit in 2014 increased to $548 million from $540 million in 2013, primarily due to higher margins in brazil, driven by a tight supply environment and an increased focus on operational improvements and price management strategies, and in argentina, driven by higher export volumes within south america. margins in north america were essentially flat, with higher margins in u.s.
41
packaged oils driven by operational improvement programs, partially offset by lower margins in refined oils on weaker export demand, rail logistics issues and, to a lesser extent, higher energy costs in the first quarter due to severe weather conditions in canada.
sg&a expenses increased to $482 million in 2014 from $384 million in 2013; sg&a for 2014 included $98 million expenses on certain icms tax credits in brazil.
segment ebit decreased to $58 million in 2014 from $163 million in 2013 as a result of factors noted above. segment ebit for 2013 included a gain of $9 million from the sale of certain legal claims in brazil.
milling products segmentmilling products segment net sales were $2,064 million in 2014, compared to $2,012 million in 2013. volumes increased by 12% primarily due to contributions from a wheat milling business in mexico, which we acquired in december 2013. this increase was partly offset by lower volumes in our wheat milling business in brazil, primarily due to our strategy to strengthen margins. the net increase in volumes was offset by lower average selling prices for corn and wheat products driven by lower average global commodity market prices relative to last year and by the impact of a weaker brazilian real and mexican  peso when translated into u.s. dollars compared to 2013.
cost of goods sold was essentially flat with $1,753 million and $1,750 million for the years 2014 and 2013, respectively. the impact of the inclusion of the acquired wheat milling business in mexico and higher prices for rice origination in the united states resulting from drought and water shortage was offset by lower prices for corn and wheat compared to the same period last year.
gross profit increased by 19% to $311 million in 2014 from $262 million in 2013, primarily as a result of inclusion of our mexican wheat milling business acquired in december 2013 and the related synergies with our existing wheat milling business in mexico. in addition, margins were higher in brazil resulting from the implementation of price management strategies. in our u.s. milling operations, gross profit declined with lower margins in corn milling only partly offset by stronger margins in rice milling.
sg&a expenses increased by $29 million to $168 million in 2014 from $139 in 2013, primarily resulting from inclusion of our wheat milling business acquired in mexico at the end of last year and $14 million expenses on certain icms tax credits in brazil, partially offset by the benefits of cost reduction initiatives and the impact of the weaker brazilian  real and mexican peso on the translation of local currency expenses to the u.s. dollar.
segment ebit increased by 5% to $131 million in 2014 from $125 million in the same period a year ago, driven by the inclusion of our acquired wheat milling operations in mexico and solid performance in brazil wheat milling and u.s. rice milling, partly offset by higher sg&a expenses, lower results in u.s. corn milling and foreign exchange losses in mexico driven by a strong devaluation of the mexican peso in the fourth quarter. segment ebit for 2013 included a gain of $6 million from the sale of certain legal claims in brazil.
sugar and bioenergy segmentsugar and bioenergy segment net sales increased 8% to $4.5 billion in 2014 compared to $4.2 billion in 2013, as a result of higher sugarcane milling volumes and energy sales in brazil. these increases were partly offset by a 6% decline in volumes, primarily in our trading and merchandising business. average ethanol and energy prices in brazil were higher compared to 2013, while average prices of sugar were lower. in our biofuels business, lower volumes were more than offset by higher u.s. corn ethanol prices.
cost of goods sold increased to $4.6 billion in 2014 from $4.1 billion in 2013. higher costs of purchased sugarcane were partially offset by lower volumes in our trading and merchandising business and the benefit of the weaker brazilian real relative to the u.s. dollar.
42
gross profit was a loss of $41 million in 2014, driven by $113 million of impairment and related charges related to one of our mills. this compared to a profit of $92 million in 2013. improved overall results in our other sugarcane mills were driven by lower costs, higher margins and increased cogeneration volumes. these improvements were more than offset by lower results in our sugar trading and distribution business in the first half of 2014.
sg&a expenses declined 6% to $156 million in 2014 from $166 in 2013. cost reduction initiatives in our industrial business and translation benefits from the depreciation of the brazilian real on local currency costs reduced sg&a, but were partially offset by $20 million of restructuring costs, including costs of our strategic review of the business. sg&a for 2013 included $11 million of write-offs and restructuring charges.
other income (expenses)net was income of $10 million compared to nil in 2013. increased income from our non-consolidated investments in a u.s. bioenergy producer and a corn wet milling venture in argentina that became fully operational in 2014, was partially offset by losses in our joint venture for the production of renewable oils in brazil.
segment ebit decreased by $108 million to a loss of $168 million in 2014 compared to a loss of $60 million in 2013. in 2014, segment ebit included $133 million of impairment and restructuring charges in our industrial operations. results from our sugarcane mills improved overall and our bioenergy investments in the u.s. and argentina also reported higher results. these improvements were partly offset by weaker trading and merchandising results and start-up losses in our renewable oils venture in brazil.
fertilizer segmentfertilizer segment net sales increased 6% to $474 million in 2014 compared to $448 million in 2013, primarily due to a volume increase of 14% in our argentine blending and distribution operations, partly offset by lower global nitrogen and phosphate prices.
cost of goods sold increased 9% to $413 million in 2014 from $379 million in 2013, primarily as a result of higher volumes and higher equipment rental costs and spare parts write-offs in our brazil port operations. these increases were partly offset by lower raw material costs and the benefit of the weaker argentine peso and brazilian real on local currency costs when translated into u.s. dollars.
gross profit decreased to $61 million in 2014 from $69 million in 2013. the decrease was primarily driven by higher costs in our brazilian port operations, partly offset by higher volumes and margins in argentina.
sg&a was $10 million in 2014 compared to $34 million in 2013. the decrease in 2014 includes the reversal of certain value added tax provisions which are no longer expected to be paid and lower general and administrative expenses. in addition, sg&a benefited from a weaker brazilian real and argentine  peso relative to the u.s. dollar.
segment ebit decreased by $24 million to $45 million in 2014 from $69 million in 2013, primarily due to a $32 million gain on the 2013 sale of certain legal claims in brazil, partially offset by a $5 million loss in 2013 in our morocco phosphate joint venture, which was sold in december 2013.
interesta summary of consolidated interest income and expense for the periods indicated follows:

interest income         $87            $76
interest expense       (347   )       (363   )
interest income in 2014 increased by $11 million compared to 2013, primarily due to higher returns on cash investments in brazil and argentina in the first half of the year and the collection of
43
$12 million of accumulated unpaid interest on a loan provided to a related party. interest expense decreased by 4% compared to last year, primarily due to lower average outstanding debt driven by reduced working capital requirements as a result of lower average commodity prices, partly offset by interest charges of $65 million related to certain icms tax credits in brazil. interest expenses were reduced due to the refinancing of long-term debt at fixed rates with short-term bank loans, which on average bear lower, floating interest rates. interest expense includes facility commitment fees, amortization of deferred financing costs and charges on certain lending transactions, including certain intercompany loans and foreign currency conversions in brazil.
income tax expensein 2014, income tax expense from continuing operations decreased to $249 million from $904 million in 2013 and the effective tax rate in 2014 decreased to 34% compared to 89% in 2013. income tax expense in 2014 included certain income tax benefits of $102 million, primarily $93 million of deferred tax assets in a subsidiary taxable in brazil, $21 million reversal of an income tax valuation allowance in europe and $13 million from adjustment of provisions upon finalization of a tax audit in europe. also, included in income tax expense for 2014 is $45 million of deferred tax assets which were recognized upon the recording of expenses related to a court ruling related to certain icms tax credits in brazil. these items were partly offset by $15 million of income tax valuation allowances resulting from management's evaluation of the recoverability of its net operating loss carryforwards in asia-pacific. income tax expense for 2013 included tax charges of $512 million for income tax valuation allowances, primarily in the sugar and bioenergy segment from management's evaluation of its net deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss carryforwards, $46 million as a result of new legal precedents that impacted our assessment of an uncertain income tax position in brazil and provisions related to tax years 2008 through 2010.
discontinued operationsdiscontinued operations results in 2014 were income of $32 million, net of tax, compared to income of $97 million, net of tax, in 2013. results in 2014 included benefits related to a tax amnesty program in brazil and collections of previously written-off farmer receivables. results in 2013 represented primarily the gain on the sale of the fertilizer blending and distribution business of $112 million, net of tax.
net income attributable to bungenet income attributable to bunge for 2014 was $515 million compared to $306 million for 2013. the decrease in total segment ebit of $373 million discussed above was more than offset by the significantly lower income tax expense from continuing operations ($249 million in 2014 compared with $904 million in 2013). income tax expense in 2014 included net tax benefits of $102 million that resulted primarily from the establishment of deferred tax assets related to the implementation of certain structural transfer pricing strategies in our agribusiness operations. we expect these structural changes to continue to contribute to reducing our overall effective tax rate. income tax expense for 2013 included charges of $512 million for income tax valuation allowances, primarily in our sugar milling business in brazil. net income for 2013 also included a $112 million after-tax gain on the sale of our fertilizer distribution business in brazil to yara for cash of $750 million. this gain is included in discontinued operations.
2013 compared to 2012
agribusiness segmentagribusiness segment net sales increased 2% to $46 billion in 2013 compared to $45 billion in 2012. volumes were 3% higher in 2013 which drove most of the increase in net sales compared to 2012 and resulted primarily from the record large brazilian harvest and higher distribution volumes into asia-pacific. volumes were slightly lower in north america and europe as these regions recovered from droughts in 2012. price increases in the first half of 2013 were offset by price declines in the second half of the year resulting from large south american harvests followed by large northern hemisphere harvests at the end of the year.
44
cost of goods sold increased 2% in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of the higher volumes in 2013. the impact of the volume increase was partially offset by the favorable impact of the devaluation of the brazilian real and argentine peso relative to the u.s. dollar on the valuation of u.s. dollar-denominated inventories. cost of goods sold for 2012 includes a charge of $25 million related to certain value-added taxes in brazil.
gross profit was essentially flat in 2013 compared with 2012 with higher volumes largely offset by the impact of the devaluation of the brazilian  real and argentine peso relative to the u.s. dollar on the valuation of u.s. dollar-denominated inventories.
sg&a expenses decreased to $836 million in 2013 from $858 million in 2012. the reduction resulted largely from the favorable impact of the devaluation of the brazilian  real and argentine peso when compared to the u.s. dollar on local currency costs, g&a cost reduction efforts during 2013 and lower bad debt expenses and higher bad debt recoveries in brazil.
foreign exchange gains were $41 million in 2013 compared to gains of $111 million in 2012 and related primarily to the 2013 weakening of international currencies, particularly the brazilian real and argentine peso, relative to the u.s. dollar. foreign exchange results in both 2013 and 2012 were partially offset by inventory mark-to-market impacts included in cost of goods sold.
noncontrolling interests was a loss of $31 million in 2013 compared to $9 million of income in 2012, and represents the noncontrolling interests' share of results at our non-wholly owned subsidiaries. the losses in 2013 primarily reflected $27 million of losses in the investment funds acquired in 2012 as well as losses in our european and north american oilseed processing joint ventures, largely driven by the tight crop situation for most of the year.
other income (expense) for 2013 was expense of $2 million compared to expense of $68 million in 2012. the reduction in net expense from 2012 results from a $66 million loss in 2012 from the sale of certain recoverable tax assets in brazil at a discount and a 2012 impairment charge of $9 million related to two equity method investments in european biodiesel producers.
gain on sale of investments in affiliates of $85 million pre-tax in 2012 resulted from the sale of our investment in solae, a north american soy ingredients joint venture, to our joint venture partner.
agribusiness segment ebit was essentially flat compared to last year, decreasing by $15 million to $1,032 million.
edible oil products segmentedible oil products segment net sales decreased 3% to $9,165 million in 2013 compared to $9,472 million in 2012 as a result of lower average selling prices in 2013, due to the reduction in vegetable oil commodity prices, which was partially offset by a 5% increase in volumes, primarily in europe and asia-pacific.
cost of goods sold decreased 4% in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower raw material prices as commodity prices declined in the latter half of 2013 due to increased crop production in key production regions. lower costs were partially offset by the higher sales volumes.
gross profit increased 21% to $540 million in 2013 from $446 million in 2012. the increase was primarily due to the 5% increase in volumes, which stemmed from a 31% increase in volumes in brazil, which struggled with an erp system implementation in 2012. margins also improved in brazil with strong pricing management in a market of declining raw material prices. results were also higher in north america, which benefited from higher margins.
sg&a expenses increased to $384 million in 2013 from $353 million in 2012. the 9% increase is primarily due to a result of increased advertising and other selling expenditures consistent with the volume increases. these were partially offset by the favorable impact of the weakening of the brazilian real relative to the u.s. dollar during 2013.
45
foreign exchange gains were $5 million in 2013 compared to losses of $8 million in 2012, which were related to movements of the brazilian  real.
noncontrolling interests were $7 million of income in 2013 compared to $2 million of losses in 2012 and represents the noncontrolling interests' share of period income at our non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, primarily our european operations.
other income (expense)net was income of $10 million in 2013 compared to expense of $7 million in 2012. other income in 2013 included a $9 million gain on the sale of certain legal claims in brazil. other expense for 2012 included a loss of $7 million related to the sale of long-term recoverable tax credits in brazil.
segment ebit increased $83 million to $163 million in 2013 from $80 million in 2012 as a result of higher gross profit, the gain on the sale of certain legal claims in brazil and foreign exchange gains in 2013.
milling products segmentmilling products segment net sales increased 10% to $2,012 million in 2013 compared to $1,833 million in 2012. the net increase in sales was primarily due to higher average selling prices, primarily in the first half of the year before the market began to move from wheat and corn deficits to surpluses in the third quarter of 2013. these price increases were partially offset by a 5% decrease in volumes, primarily in brazilian wheat milling, where volumes declined due to an increased focus on margins.
cost of goods sold increased 7% in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily as a result of higher commodity prices when compared to 2012 partially offset by the impact of lower volumes.
gross profit increased 30% to $262 million in 2013 from $201 million in 2012 primarily due to our brazilian wheat milling operations focused on margin management and largely recovering from difficulties associated with a system implementation in 2012. we also benefitted from a full year of results from the consolidation of our 2012 acquisition of a controlling interest in a wheat milling business in mexico, where volumes and margins improved.
sg&a expenses increased to $139 million in 2013 from $123 million in 2012. the 13% increase is primarily due to additional costs from inclusion of our wheat milling business in mexico partially offset by the favorable impact of the weakening brazilian real relative to the u.s. dollar. sg&a in 2013 included a $7 million charge related to recoverable taxes in brazil.
other income (expense)net was income of $2 million in 2013 compared to nil in 2012. included in 2013 is a $6 million gain on the sale of certain legal claims in brazil.
gain on acquisition of controlling interest of $36 million in 2012 relates to the adjustment to fair value of the previously held noncontrolling interest in a north american wheat milling operation upon assuming control of that operation in the second quarter of 2012.
segment ebit increased $10 million to $125 million in 2013 from $115 million in 2012. the result for 2013 was driven by higher gross profit. included in 2012 was a gain on acquisition of controlling interest of $36 million.
sugar and bioenergy segmentsugar and bioenergy segment net sales decreased 10% to $4,215 million compared to $4,659 million in 2012. the decreased sales were primarily driven by a significant decline in prices, particularly sugar compared with 2012. average selling prices in 2013 were 26% lower than the previous year. the impact of these price declines was partially offset by a 32% increase in volumes in our trading and merchandising business in 2013 that was only partially offset by a reduction in sales volumes in our industrial business.
46
cost of goods sold decreased 10% in 2013 compared to 2012 driven primarily by lower overall sugar prices in our trading and merchandising business and a weaker brazilian  real, which was partially offset by increased sales volumes in our trading and merchandising business.
gross profit increased 44% to $92 million in 2013 from $64 million in 2012 primarily as a result of strong trading and merchandising volumes and good risk management performance, as well as increased production (cane crushing) volumes, which improved capacity utilization and reduced unitary costs.
sg&a expenses decreased to $166 million in 2013 from $194 million in 2012, which included a $29 million charge for impairment of a loan receivable from a north american corn ethanol joint venture and a gain of $16 million related to the sale of an investment in a logistics facility in brazil. sg&a benefited from the weakening of the brazilian  real in 2013 compared with 2012. sg&a in 2013 included impairment and restructuring charges of $11 million related to our cost reduction efforts in our industrial business.
foreign exchange gains were $3 million in 2013 compared to losses of $15 million in 2012, which were related to movements of the brazilian  real.
noncontrolling interests were $9 million of losses in 2013 compared to $25 million of losses in 2012 and represent the noncontrolling interests' shares of period losses from our non-wholly owned brazilian sugarcane mills.
equity of earnings in affiliates was a loss of $2 million in 2013 compared with losses of $27 million in 2012, which included a charge of $10 million related to the write-down of an investment in a north american bioenergy joint venture.
other income (expense)net was nil in 2013 compared to a loss of $3 million in 2012 primarily due to improved results in our north american bioenergy investments.
a goodwill impairment charge of $514 million, representing all of the segment's goodwill assets, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012 upon completion of our annual impairment analysis. this analysis applies equal weighting to comparable market multiples (the market approach) and discounted cash flow projections (the income approach) to determine a range of values for the fair value of the reporting unit. all of the goodwill in our sugar business has been assigned at the segment level. the income approach estimates fair value by discounting the segment's estimated future cash flows using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions and the risk profile of the business and includes, among other things, making assumptions about variables such as sugar and ethanol prices, future profitability, future capital expenditures and discount rates that might be used by a market participant. all of these assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment. there was a significant decline in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit primarily due to lower current trading multiples of comparable companies in the industry, a lack of market transactions to provide independent insight into the market's perception of the current value of sugar milling operations and declines in global prices for both sugar and ethanol. based on a detailed review of the results of these valuation approaches, it was determined that there were indicators of a potential impairment of the goodwill and further analysis was done to evaluate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the segment as of the october 1, 2012 testing date. this allocation of the fair value included higher replacement values of our sugarcane mills compared to 2011, increased value allocated to sugarcane plantations and increased values of transportation and mechanization equipment related to sugarcane planting and harvesting. upon completion of the analysis, 100% of the goodwill was determined to be impaired and a related charge was recorded within the segment. this non-cash charge does not have any impact on current or future cash flows or the performance of the underlying business.
segment ebit improved by $577 million to a loss of $60 million in 2013 from a loss of $637 million in 2012. included in the 2012 period were $496 million of non-cash impairment charges
47
for goodwill and $39 million of charges related to write-downs of an investment in and loan receivable from a north american biofuels company and a $16 million gain on the sale of a logistics asset in brazil. higher gross profit in 2013 and lower sg&a expenses combined with improved performance in our north american bioenergy investments and foreign exchange gains in the period contributed to the improvement.
fertilizer segmentfertilizer segment net sales decreased 4% to $448 million in 2013 compared to $466 million in 2012. net sales decreased primarily due to lower average selling prices which declined 1% and a 3% decrease in sales volumes from reduced corn and wheat planting in argentina as a result of a drought.
cost of goods sold decreased 3% in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of sales volume decreases.
gross profit decreased 9% to $69 million in 2013 from $76 million in 2012. the decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by lower 2013 margins in argentina.
sg&a decreased to $34 million in 2013 compared with $35 million in the same period of 2012 and resulted largely from the favorable impact of the devaluation of the argentine peso on local currency costs.
foreign exchange gains were $5 million in 2013 compared to losses of $1 million in 2012.
noncontrolling interests were $5 million of income in 2013 compared to $3 million of income in 2012 and represent the noncontrolling interests' share of period income at our non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, primarily in our fertilizer port terminal operations in brazil.
other income (expense)net was income of $34 million in 2013 compared to a loss of $14 million in 2012. the improved results stemmed from a $32 million gain on the sale of certain legal claims in brazil and reduced losses in our moroccan phosphate joint venture, which was sold in december 2013
segment ebit increased $46 million to $69 million in 2013 from $23 million in 2012 driven by the $32 million gain on the sale of certain legal claims in brazil and lower losses in our moroccan joint venture.
interesta summary of consolidated interest income and expense for the periods indicated follows:

interest income         $76            $53
interest expense       (363   )       (294   )
interest income increased when compared to 2012 as a result of higher average interest bearing cash balances. interest expense increased when compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher average local borrowings and borrowing rates. interest expense includes facility commitment fees, amortization of deferred financing costs and charges on certain lending transactions, including certain intercompany loans and foreign currency conversions in brazil.
income tax expensein 2013, income tax expense from continuing operations was $904 million compared to an income tax benefit of $6 million in 2012. the effective tax rate in 2013 increased to 89% compared to a benefit of 2% in 2012 primarily due to the full valuation allowances of $464 million related to our brazil sugar operations and to other valuation allowances and discrete income tax charges of $98 million. the effective tax rate for 2012 was a benefit of 2% which included a tax benefit of $175 million related to the goodwill impairment charge in our sugar and bioenergy segment. goodwill amortization is tax deductible in brazil. this benefit reduced the effective tax rate for 2012 by 20%.
48
discontinued operationsdiscontinued operations results in 2013 were income of $97 million, net of tax, compared to a loss of $342 million, net of tax, in 2012. results in 2013 were driven by the gain on the sale of the fertilizer blending and distribution business of $112 million, net of tax. the net after-tax loss of $342 million in 2012 is primarily the result of nonrecurring charges associated with the then pending sale of the brazilian fertilizer blending and distribution operations, including an after-tax charge of $32 million related to an evaluation of the impact of the pending sale on recovery of long-term receivables from farmers in brazil and a charge of $266 million related to an income tax valuation allowance as the pending sale of the business reduced our ability to utilize this tax asset. results of operations for the discontinued businesses were a loss of $44 million in 2012 and resulted from weakness in the brazilian fertilizer market and an after-tax charge of $18 million related to a provision for a legacy environmental claim from 1998 in brazil.
net income attributable to bungein 2013, net income attributable to bunge increased to $306 million from $64 million in 2012. net income attributable to bunge for 2013 includes significant tax charges of $512 million for income tax valuation allowances, primarily in the sugar and bioenergy segment from management's evaluation of its net operating loss carryfowards, $46 million as a result of new legal precedents that impacted our assessment of an uncertain income tax position in brazil and provisions related to tax years 2008 through 2010, and $4 million related to the finalization of a european tax audit. net income attributable to bunge for 2013 also includes a $112 million after-tax gain on the sale of our fertilizer blending and distribution business in brazil to yara for cash of $750 million. net income attributable to bunge for 2012 includes a goodwill impairment charge of $327 million (after-tax and noncontrolling interest share) in the sugar and bioenergy segment, an after-tax gain of $54 million on the sale of our investment in the solae company and an after-tax loss of $342 million associated with discontinued fertilizer operations held for sale at december 31, 2012. this 2012 loss in discontinued operations includes a $266 million valuation allowance for certain tax assets that were no longer expected to be recoverable as a result of the planned sale of the fertilizer blending and distribution business.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our main financial objectives are to prudently manage financial risks, ensure consistent access to liquidity and minimize cost of capital in order to efficiently finance our business and maintain balance sheet strength. we generally finance our ongoing operations with cash flows generated from operations, issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under various bilateral and revolving credit facilities, term loans and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. acquisitions and long-lived assets are generally financed with a combination of equity and long-term debt.
our current ratio, which is a widely used measure of liquidity and is defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, was 1.50 and 1.42 at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
cash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalents were $362 million at december 31, 2014 and $742 million at december 31, 2013. cash balances are managed in accordance with our investment policy, the objectives of which are to preserve the principal value of our cash assets, maintain a high degree of liquidity and deliver competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions. cash balances are invested in short-term deposits with highly rated financial institutions and in u.s. government securities.
readily marketable inventoriesreadily marketable inventories are agricultural commodity inventories, such as soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, wheat, and sugar that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms. readily marketable inventories in our agribusiness segment are
49
reported at fair value and were $4,125 million at december 31, 2014 and $4,325 million at december 31, 2013. of these amounts $2,937 million and $2,927 million were attributable to merchandising activities at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. readily marketable inventories at fair value in the aggregate amount of $127 million and $138 million at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively, were included in our edible oil products segment inventories. the sugar and bioenergy segment included readily marketable sugar inventories of $157 million and $137 million at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively which can be attributed to our trading and merchandising business.
financing arrangements and outstanding indebtednesswe conduct most of our financing activities through a centralized financing structure that provides the company efficient access to debt and capital markets. this structure includes a master trust, the primary assets of which consist of intercompany loans made to bunge limited and its subsidiaries. certain of bunge limited's 100% owned finance subsidiaries, bunge limited finance corp., bunge finance europe b.v. and bunge asset funding corp., fund the master trust with short and long-term debt obtained from third parties, including through our commercial paper program and certain credit facilities, as well as the issuance of senior notes. borrowings by these finance subsidiaries carry full, unconditional guarantees by bunge limited.
revolving credit facilitiesat december 31, 2014, we had $5,015 million of aggregate committed borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities, of which $4,477 million was unused and available. the following table summarizes these facilities as of the periods presented:

commercial paper                           2019                   $600              $            $100

(1)
borrowings under the revolving credit facilities that have maturities greater than one year from the date of the consolidated balance sheets are classified as long-term debt, consistent with the long-term maturity of the underlying facilities. however, individual borrowings under the revolving credit facilities are generally short-term in nature, bear interest at variable rates and can be repaid or renewed as each such individual borrowing matures.
on december 12, 2014, we entered into an unsecured five year multi-currency syndicated term loan agreement (the "loan") in the japanese loan market, with certain lenders party thereto. the loan is comprised of three tranches: tranche a of japanese yen 28.5 billion, bearing interest at 3 months libor plus a margin of 0.75%; tranche b of japanese yen 6 billion bearing a fixed interest rate of 0.96%; and tranche c of $85 million bearing interest at 3 months libor plus a margin of 1.30%. at december 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the loan.
on november 20, 2014, we entered into an unsecured $1,100 million five-year syndicated revolving credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with certain lenders party thereto. we have the option to request an extension of the maturity date of the credit agreement for two additional one-year periods, each lender in its sole discretion may agree to any such request. the credit agreement replaced the then existing u.s. $1,085 million five-year revolving credit agreement, dated as of november 17, 2011. borrowings under the credit agreement will bear interest at libor plus a margin, which will vary from 1.00% to 1.75%, based on the credit ratings of our senior long-term unsecured debt ("rating level"). amounts under the credit agreement that remain undrawn are subject to a commitment fee at rates ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%, varying based on the rating level. we may, from time-to-time,
50
request one or more of the existing lenders or new lenders to increase the total commitments under the credit agreement by up to $500 million pursuant to an accordion provision. at december 31, 2014, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement.
on june 17, 2014, we increased pursuant to an accordion provision the $665 million five-year syndicated revolving credit agreement with cobank, acb, (the "cobank facility") as administrative agent and certain lender party thereto to $865 million. borrowings under the cobank facility will bear interest at libor plus a margin, which will vary between 1.050% and 1.675% per annum, based on the credit ratings of our long-term senior unsecured debt. amounts under the cobank facility that remain undrawn are subject to a commitment fee at rates ranging from 0.125% to 0.275% per annum based likewise on the ratings of our long-term senior unsecured debt. at december 31, 2014, there was $338 million outstanding under the cobank facility.
on march 17, 2014, we entered into an unsecured $1,750 million three-year syndicated revolving credit facility (the "facility") with certain lenders party thereto. we have the option to request an extension of the maturity date of the facility for two additional one-year periods, each lender in its sole discretion may agree to any such request. borrowings under the facility will bear interest at libor plus a margin, which will vary from 0.70% to 1.70% per annum, based on the credit ratings of our senior long-term unsecured debt. we will also pay a fee that varies from 0.10% to 0.40% per annum, based on the utilization of the facility. amounts under the facility that remain undrawn are subject to a commitment fee payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of 35% of the margin specified above, which will vary based on the rating level at each such quarterly payment date. we may, from time-to-time, with the consent of the facility agent, request one or more of the existing lenders or new lenders to increase the total commitments under the facility by up to $250 million pursuant to an accordion provision. at december 31, 2014, we had no borrowings outstanding under the facility.
our commercial paper program is supported by committed back-up bank credit lines (the "liquidity facility") equal to the amount of the commercial paper program provided by lending institutions that are required to be rated at least a-1 by standard & poor's and p-1 by moody's investor services. the cost of borrowing under the liquidity facility would typically be higher than the cost of issuance under our commercial paper program. on november 20, 2014 we entered into an unsecured $600 million five-year liquidity facility with certain lenders party thereto. the liquidity facility replaced the then existing $600 million five-year liquidity facility, dated as of november 17, 2011. we have the option to request an extension of the expiration date of the liquidity agreement for two additional one-year periods, each lender in its sole discretion may agree to any such request. at december 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under both the commercial paper program and the liquidity facility. our commercial paper program is our only revolving credit facility that requires lenders to maintain minimum credit ratings.
in addition to committed credit facilities, from time-to-time, we enter into bilateral short-term credit lines as necessary based on our financing requirements. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, $50 million and $120 million, respectively, were outstanding under these bilateral short-term credit lines.
short and long-term debtour short and long-term debt decreased by $787 million at december 31, 2014 from december 31, 2013, primarily due to lower working capital financing requirements, driven by lower average global commodity prices. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our average short and long-term debt outstanding was approximately $5,372 million compared to approximately $6,465 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. our long-term debt outstanding
51
balance was $3,263 million at december 31, 2014 compared to $3,941 million at december 31, 2013. the following table summarizes our short-term debt activity at december 31, 2014.

(1)
short-term rating applies only to bunge asset funding corp., the issuer under our commercial paper program.
our debt agreements do not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate maturity of our debt. however, credit rating downgrades would increase our borrowing costs under our credit facilities and, depending on their severity, could impede our ability to obtain credit facilities or access the capital markets in the future on competitive terms subject to prevailing market conditions. a significant increase in our borrowing costs could impair our ability to compete effectively in our business relative to competitors with higher credit ratings.
our credit facilities and certain senior notes require us to comply with specified financial covenants, including minimum net worth, minimum current ratio, a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and limitations on secured indebtedness. we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31, 2014.
trade receivable securitization programwe initially entered into our trade receivable securitization program (the "program") in june 2011, which provides us with an additional source of liquidity. the program provides funding for up to $700 million against receivables sold and terminates on june 1, 2016. however, each committed purchaser's commitment to fund trade receivables sold under program will terminate on may 27, 2015 unless extended for additional 364-day periods in accordance with the terms of the receivables transfer agreement.
at december 31, 2014 and 2013, $599 million and $696 million, respectively, of receivables sold under the program were derecognized from our consolidated balance sheets. proceeds received in cash related to transfers of receivables under the program totaled $12,030 million and $12,596 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. in addition, cash collections from customers on receivables previously sold were $12,202 million and $12,769 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. as this is a revolving facility, cash collections from customers are reinvested to fund new receivable sales. gross receivables sold under the program for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 were $12,179 million and $12,779 million, respectively. these sales resulted in discounts of $7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, $7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 and $8 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, which were included in sg&a in the consolidated statements of income. servicing fees under the program were not significant in any period.
our risk of loss following the sale of the trade receivables is limited to the deferred purchase price receivable ("dpp"), which at december 31, 2014 and 2013 had a fair value of $78 million and $96 million, respectively, and is included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets (see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements). the dpp will be repaid in cash as receivables are collected, generally within 30 days. delinquencies and credit losses on trade receivables sold under the program during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were insignificant. bunge has reflected all cash flows under the program as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
interest rate swap agreementswe may use interest rate swaps as hedging instruments and record the swaps at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded
53
contemporaneously in earnings. additionally, the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value due to changes in benchmark interest rates. ineffectiveness, as defined in asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging, is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset.
equitytotal equity was $8,690 million at december 31, 2014, as set forth in the following table:

convertible perpetual preference shares                            $690               $690

total bunge shareholders' equity decreased to $8,690 million at december 31, 2014 from $10,088 million at december 31, 2013. the change in equity was due primarily to cumulative translation losses of $1,411 million, resulting from the devaluation of global currencies relative to the u.s. dollar in 2014, and declared dividends to common and preferred shareholders of $192 million and $34 million, respectively, partially offset by net income attributable to bunge for the year ended december 31, 2014 of $515 million.
noncontrolling interest increased to $244 million at december 31, 2014 from $231 million at december 31, 2013 primarily due to capital contributions to two of our noncontrolling interests in brazil and argentina.
at december 31, 2014, we had 6,900,000 4.875% cumulative convertible perpetual preference shares outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of $690 million. each convertible perpetual preference share has an initial liquidation preference of $100, which will be adjusted for any accumulated and unpaid dividends. the convertible perpetual preference shares carry an annual dividend of $4.875 per share payable quarterly. as a result of adjustments made to the initial conversion price because cash dividends paid on bunge limited's common shares exceeded certain specified thresholds, each convertible perpetual preference share is convertible, at the holder's option, at any time into 1.1220 bunge limited common shares, based on the conversion price of $89.1299 per share, subject to certain additional anti-dilution adjustments (which represents 7,741,800 bunge limited common shares at december 31, 2014). at any time on or after december 1, 2012, if the closing price of our common shares equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion price for 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading days (including the last trading day of such period), we may elect to cause the convertible perpetual preference shares to be automatically converted into bunge limited common shares at the then-prevailing conversion price. the convertible perpetual preference shares are not redeemable by us at any time.
cash flows our cash flow from operations varies depending on, among other items, the market prices and timing of the purchase and sale of our inventories. generally, during periods when commodity prices are rising, our agribusiness operations require increased use of cash to support working capital to acquire inventories and fund daily settlement requirements on exchange traded futures that we use to minimize price risk related to our inventories.
54
2014 compared to 2013in 2014, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $380 million reflecting the net effect of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. for the year ended december 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $173 million.
cash provided by our operating activities was $1,399 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $2,225 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. net cash inflows from operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 were principally due to net income, including adjustments for non-cash items. the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to lower working capital levels than at december 31, 2013, resulting from on average lower global commodity prices, which effect was partially offset by the impact of the depreciation from certain currencies, including the brazilian real, argentine peso, ukrainian hryvnia and european euro relative to the u.s. dollar. the net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2013 resulted from a combination of net income adjusted for non-cash charges and lower average commodity prices during the year. non-cash charges in 2013 included an income tax valuation allowance of $464 million related to our industrial sugar and bioenergy business in brazil.
certain of our non-u.s. operating subsidiaries are primarily funded with u.s. dollar-denominated debt, while currency risk is hedged with u.s. dollar denominated assets. the functional currency of our operations is generally the local currency. also, certain of our u.s. dollar functional operating subsidiaries outside the united states are partially funded with local currency borrowings, while the currency risk is hedged with local currency denominated assets. the financial statements of our subsidiaries are calculated in the functional currency, and when the local currency is the functional currency translated into u.s. dollar. u.s. dollar-denominated loans are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates at the applicable balance sheet date. local currency loans are remeasured into u.s. dollar at the exchange rate at the applicable balance sheet date. the resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains or losses. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, we recorded foreign exchange gains of $215 million and $48 million, respectively, which were included as adjustments to reconcile net income to cash used for operating activities in the line item "foreign exchange loss (gain) on debt" in our consolidated statements of cash flows. this adjustment is required because the cash flow impacts of these gains or losses are recognized as financing activities when the subsidiary repays the underlying debt and therefore, have no impact on cash flows from operations.
cash used for investing activities was $685 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to cash used of $429 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. during 2014, payments were made for capital expenditures of $839 million, including investments in sugar cane planting and maintenance on mills in our sugar and bioenergy business in brazil, the construction of a port terminal and a wheat milling facility in brazil, construction and expansion of edible oil refining and packaging facilities in the united states and mexico, one of our canola processing facilities in canada and construction of a port facility and oilseed processing plant in ukraine, an oilseed processing plant in asia and a port facility in australia. payments made for capital expenditures in 2014 were lower, compared to $1,042 million in 2013, which was driven by management's reallocation of capital and generally lower capital expenditures in our industrial sugar and bioenergy operations in brazil, as part of the strategic review of these activities. we also acquired a fertilizer plant with port facilities for $24 million in argentina and the assets of a corn flour producer in the united states for $12 million, all amounts net of cash acquired. for the year ended december 31, 2013, cash used for investing activities included cash proceeds of $750 million from the sale of our brazilian fertilizer distribution business to yara, the sale of our 50% ownership interest in our morocco fertilizer business for $37 million and the sale of property from our consolidated investment funds of $48 million. in addition, cash used for investing activities in 2013 included cash payments for the acquisitions of a wheat milling business in mexico for $310 million, a wheat mill in brazil for $35 million and two biodiesel facilities in europe for $11 million, all amounts net of cash acquired. proceeds from and payments for investments
55
for both the years 2014 and 2013 included primarily the sales of assets in funds in our asset management business and the purchases and sales of certain marketable securities and other short-term investments. investments in affiliates in 2014 included primarily an additional investment in solazyme bunge produtos renovaveis ltda. ("sb oils"), our joint venture with solazyme, inc. to produce renewable oils in brazil. investments in 2013 included primarily investments in sb oils and a corn wet milling and port facility in argentina.
cash used for financing activities was $1,058 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $1,565 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. for both years, financing activities reflected reduced financing requirements due to a declining global commodity price environment. in connection with our common share repurchase program, in 2014 we purchased 3,780,987 of our common shares resulting in a cash outflow of approximately $300 million. there were no share repurchases in the year ended december 31, 2013.
2013 compared to 2012in 2013, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $173 million reflecting the net effect of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. for the year ended december 31, 2012, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $266 million.
cash provided by our operating activities was $2,225 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to cash used of $457 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2013 resulted from a combination of net income adjusted for non-cash charges and lower average commodity prices during the year, which reduced working capital requirements. non-cash charges in 2013 included an income tax valuation allowance of $464 million related to our industrial sugar business in brazil. the net cash outflows for operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2012 were principally due to significant increases in commodity prices during that period as a result of the 2012 drought in the united states.
certain of our operating subsidiaries are primarily funded with u.s. dollar denominated debt. the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries is generally the local currency and the financial statements are calculated in the functional currency and translated into u.s. dollars. u.s. dollar denominated loans funding certain short-term borrowing needs of our operating subsidiaries are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates at the applicable balance sheet date. the resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains or losses. for the years ended december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012, we recorded foreign exchange gains of $48 million and $74 million, respectively, on debt denominated primarily in u.s. dollars at our subsidiaries, which were included as adjustments to reconcile net income to cash used for operating activities in the line item "foreign exchange loss (gain) on debt" in our consolidated statements of cash flows. this adjustment is required because the cash flow impacts of these gains or losses are recognized as financing activities when the subsidiary repays the underlying debt and therefore, have no impact on cash flows from operations.
cash used for investing activities was $429 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to cash used of $967 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the significantly lower utilization for investing activities in the 2013 period resulted from $750 million of cash proceeds from the sale of our brazilian fertilizer distribution business to yara, the sale of our 50% ownership interest in our morocco fertilizer business for $37 million and the sale of property from our consolidated investment funds of $48 million. these proceeds offset capital expenditures during the period as well as our purchases of a wheat milling business in mexico for $310 million, a wheat mill in brazil for $35 million, and two biodiesel facilities adjacent to our plants in europe from our joint venture for $11 million (all amounts net of cash acquired).
for the year ended december 31, 2012, cash used for investing activities primarily included investments in property, plant and equipment related to the expansion of our sugar business in brazil, investments in an edible oil refining and packaging facility in the united states and canada,
56
construction of a refining facility in india and construction of a port terminal in brazil. in addition to capital expenditures, we acquired an edible oils and fats business in india for $94 million net of cash acquired consisting of $77 million in cash and debt acquired of $17 million. in addition, we acquired an asset management company for $9 million net of cash acquired, a controlling interest in a north american wheat milling business for $102 million net of cash acquired, and redeemable noncontrolling interest of $8 million, intellectual property assets for $22 million and sugarcane milling related biological assets and equipment for $61 million and controlling interest in a european oilseed processing and biodiesel joint venture for $54 million consisting of $17 million in cash and redeemable noncontrolling interest of $37 million. finally, we acquired a margarine business in poland for $7 million in cash. cash used for the year ended december 31, 2012 was net of $448 million proceeds received from the sale of our interest in solae, a soy ingredients joint venture. we also received a special cash dividend of $35 million from solae in connection with the sale of our investment.
investments in affiliates in 2013 included primarily additional investments in a corn wet milling entity and investments in a port operation, both in argentina, and investments in our sb oils joint venture to produce vegetable oil from sugar produced in one of our mills in brazil. investments in 2012 involved activities related to the construction of an oilseed processing plant in paraguay, construction of a corn wet milling plant in argentina, an investment in a palm plantation joint venture in indonesia and an additional investment in a north american corn ethanol joint venture.
cash used for financing activities was $1,565 million in the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to cash provided by of $1,206 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. for the year ended december 31, 2013, operating cash inflows reflected a declining commodity price environment and the cash collected from the sale of our brazilian fertilizer distribution business, both of which reduced our financing requirements. in 2012, we had a net increase of $1,368 million in borrowings due to increased working capital requirements related to higher commodity prices. dividends paid to our common shareholders in the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 were $167 million and $151 million, respectively. dividends paid to holders of our convertible preference shares were $34 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012. there were no shares repurchased under our share repurchase program during either of the years ended december 31, 2013 or 2012.
brazilian farmer credit backgroundwe advance funds to farmers, primarily in brazil, through secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity purchase contracts. these activities are generally intended to be short-term in nature. the ability of our customers and suppliers to repay these amounts is affected by agricultural economic conditions in the relevant geography, which are, in turn, affected by commodity prices, currency exchange rates, crop input costs and crop quality and yields. as a result, these arrangements are typically secured by the farmer's crop and, in many cases, the farmer's land and other assets. upon farmer default, we generally initiate legal proceedings to recover the defaulted amounts. however, the legal recovery process through the judicial system is a long-term process, generally spanning a number of years. as a result, once accounts have been submitted to the judicial process for recovery, we may also seek to renegotiate certain terms with the defaulting farmer in order to accelerate recovery of amounts owed. in addition, we have tightened our credit policies to reduce exposure to higher risk accounts and have increased collateral requirements for certain customers.
because brazilian farmer credit exposures are denominated in local currency, reported values are impacted by movements in the value of the brazilian  real when translated into u.s. dollars. from december 31, 2013 to december 31, 2014, the brazilian  real devalued by approximately 13%, decreasing the reported farmer credit exposure balances when translated into u.s. dollars.
we periodically evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable and record allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful. we base our determination of the allowance on analyses of
57
credit quality of individual accounts, considering also the economic and financial condition of the farming industry and other market conditions as well as the value of any collateral related to amounts owed. we continuously review defaulted farmer receivables for impairment on an individual account basis. we consider all accounts in legal collections processes to be defaulted and past due. for such accounts, we determine the allowance for uncollectible amounts based on the fair value of the associated collateral, net of estimated costs to sell. for all renegotiated accounts (current and past due), we consider changes in farm economic conditions and other market conditions, our historical experience related to renegotiated accounts and the fair value of collateral in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts.
secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity contractswe purchase soybeans through prepaid commodity purchase contracts (advance cash payments to suppliers against contractual obligations to deliver specified quantities of soybeans in the future) and secured advances to suppliers (advances to suppliers against commitments to deliver soybeans in the future), primarily in brazil. these financing arrangements are typically secured by the farmer's future crop and mortgages on the farmer's land, buildings and equipment, and are generally settled after the farmer's crop is harvested and sold.
interest earned on secured advances to suppliers of $37 million, $32 million and $27 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is included in net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
the table below shows details of prepaid commodity contracts and secured advances to suppliers outstanding at our brazilian operations as of the dates indicated. see notes 6 and 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.

commodities delivered by suppliers that are yet to be priced are reflected at prevailing market prices at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively.
capital expenditures our cash payments made for capital expenditures were $839 million, $1,042 million and $1,095 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we intend to make capital expenditures of approximately $875 million in 2015. our priorities for 2015 capital expenditures are maintenance, safety and environmental programs first (where we expect to use approximately 40% of our funds allocated to capital expenditures), projects enhancing productivity of our operations-second, and growth projects-third. we intend to fund these capital expenditures primarily with cash flows from operations.

off-balance sheet arrangements guarantees we have issued or were party to the following guarantees at december 31, 2014:

unconsolidated affiliates financing(1)       $106
residual value guarantee(2)                  149
total                                        $255
(1)
we issued guarantees to certain financial institutions related to debt of certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures. the terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings which have maturity dates in 2015 through 2018. there are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. at december 31, 2014, we had no outstanding recorded obligation related to these guarantees.
(2)
we issued guarantees to certain financial institutions which are party to certain operating lease arrangements for railcars and barges. these guarantees provide for a minimum residual value to be received by the lessor at the conclusion of the lease term. these leases expire at various dates from 2016 through 2019. at december 31, 2014, our recorded obligation related to these guarantees was $6 million.
in addition, bunge limited has provided full and unconditional parent level guarantees of the outstanding indebtedness under certain senior credit facilities and senior notes entered into or issued by its 100% owned subsidiaries. at december 31, 2014, debt with a carrying amount of $3,284 million related to these guarantees is included in our consolidated balance sheet. this debt includes the senior notes issued by two of our 100% owned finance subsidiaries, bunge limited finance corp. and bunge n.a. finance l.p. there are no significant restrictions on the ability of bunge limited finance corp., bunge n.a. finance l.p. or any other of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to bunge limited.

(3)
in the ordinary course of business, we enter into purchase commitments for time on ocean freight vessels and freight service on railroad lines for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities. in addition, we sell time on these ocean freight vessels when excess freight capacity is available. payments to be received by us under such relet agreements are anticipated to be approximately $11 million in 2015 and $7 million in 2016-2017. these agreements range from two months to approximately seven years in the case of ocean freight vessels and 5 to 17 years in the case of railroad services. actual amounts paid under these contracts may differ due to the variable components of these agreements and the amount of income earned by us on the sale of excess capacity. the railroad freight services agreements require a minimum monthly payment regardless of the actual level of freight services used by us. the costs of our freight supply agreements are typically passed through to our customers as a component of the prices we charge for our products. however, changes in the market value of freight compared to the rates at which we have contracted for freight may affect margins on the sales of agricultural commodities.
(4)
does not include estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions. as of december 31, 2014, bunge had gross related tax liabilities of $83 million, including interest and penalties. at this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.

does not include obligations for pension and postretirement benefits for which we expect to make employer contributions of $23 million in 2015. we also expect to make a significant contribution to our plans in future years.
in addition, we have entered into partnership agreements for the production of sugarcane. these agreements have an average remaining life of six years and cover approximately 230,000 hectares of land under cultivation. amounts owed under these agreements are dependent on several variables including the quantity of sugarcane produced per hectare, the total recoverable sugar ("atr") per ton of sugarcane produced and the price for each kilogram of atr as determined by consecana, the são paulo state sugarcane and sugar and ethanol council. in the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, bunge made payments related to these agreements of $162 million, $169 million and $181 million, respectively. of these amounts $95 million, $107 million and $127 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were advances for future purchases and $67 million, $62 million and $54 million were included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
employee benefit plans we expect to contribute $15 million to our defined benefit pension plans and $8 million to our postretirement healthcare benefit plans in 2015.
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report on form 10-k.
allowances for uncollectible accounts accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers are stated at the historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. we establish an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivable and secured advances to farmers based on historical experience, farming, economic and other market conditions as well as specific identified customer collection issues. uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount that is less than the outstanding historical balance or when we have determined that collection of the balance is unlikely.
we follow the accounting guidance on the disclosure of the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses which requires information to be disclosed at disaggregated levels, defined as portfolio segments and classes. based upon an analysis of credit losses and risk factors to be
60
considered in determining the allowance for credit losses, we have determined that the long-term receivables from farmers in brazil are a single portfolio segment.
we evaluate this single portfolio segment by class of receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring risk. we have identified accounts in legal collection processes and renegotiated amounts as classes of long-term receivables from farmers. valuation allowances for accounts in legal collection processes are determined by us on individual accounts based on the fair value of the collateral provided as security for the secured advance or credit sale. the fair value is determined using a combination of internal and external resources, including published information concerning brazilian land values by region. for determination of the valuation allowances for renegotiated amounts, we consider historical experience with the individual farmers, current weather and crop conditions, as well as the fair value of non-crop collateral.
for both classes, a long-term receivable from farmers in brazil is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if we determine it to be probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected. recognition of interest income on secured advances to farmers is suspended once the farmer defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined not to be probable. no additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery, where amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized interest income.
inventories and derivatives we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and energy costs and for positioning our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements in accordance with established policies and procedures. we are exposed to loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties to certain of these contracts. the risk of non-performance is routinely monitored and adjustments recorded, if necessary, to account for potential non-performance. different assumptions, changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of the counterparties to these derivative instruments could result in additional fair value adjustments and increased expense reflected in cost of goods sold, foreign exchange or interest expense. we did not have significant allowances relating to non-performance by counterparties at december 31, 2014 or 2013.
our readily marketable commodity inventories, forward purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and options are primarily valued at fair value. readily marketable inventories are freely-traded, have quoted market prices, may be sold without significant additional processing and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs. we estimate fair values of commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. changes in the fair values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of goods sold. if we used different methods or factors to estimate fair values, amounts reported as inventories and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in the consolidated balance sheets and cost of goods sold could differ. additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and cost of goods sold could differ.
recoverable taxes we evaluate the collectability of our recoverable taxes and record valuation allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful. recoverable taxes primarily represent value-added or other similar transactional taxes paid on the acquisition of raw materials and other services which can be
61
recovered in cash or as compensation of outstanding balances against income taxes or certain other taxes we may owe. management's assumption about the collectability of recoverable taxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the applicable federal or local government to refund the taxes. the balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories, purchases of new inventories, percentages of export sales, seasonality, changes in applicable tax rates, cash payment by the applicable government agencies and compensation of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the applicable governments. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the allowance for recoverable taxes was $43 million and $70 million, respectively. we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and in cases where we determine that recovery is doubtful, recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts.
property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of property, plant and equipment assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets. if it appears that the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against results of operations. our judgments related to the expected useful lives of property, plant and equipment assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our property, plant and equipment assets, changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges. bunge recorded impairment charges of $114 million for certain agricultural and industrial assets in its sugar and bioenergy segment during the year ended december 31, 2014.
contingencies we are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits, primarily tax and labor claims in brazil and tax claims in argentina, and have accrued our estimates of the probable costs to resolve these claims. these estimates have been developed in consultation with in-house and outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings. for more information on tax and labor claims in brazil, see "item 3. legal proceedings."
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize. we consider projections of future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the size of the valuation allowances. if we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount, we decrease the valuation allowance, thereby increasing net income. conversely, if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset, we increase the valuation allowance, thereby decreasing net income.
62
we apply a "more likely than not" threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits. the calculation of our uncertain tax positions involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. we recognize potential liabilities and record uncertain tax positions for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states, brazil, argentina and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not additional taxes will be due. we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. if our estimate of uncertain tax positions proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determined the liabilities are no longer necessary. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had recorded uncertain tax positions of $83 million and $171 million, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets.
new accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncementsin may 2014, the fasb amended asc (topic 605) revenue recognition and created asc (topic 606) revenue from contracts with customers. the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. early application is not permitted. bunge is evaluating the expected impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
in february 2015, the fasb issued asu (topic 810) consolidationamendments to the consolidation analysis. the standard makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entity (vie) guidance. the standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is allowed. bunge is evaluating the expected impact of this standard on the consolidation of certain private equity and other investment funds related to our asset management business.

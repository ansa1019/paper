basis of presentation and separation from agilent on november 1, 2014, keysight technologies, inc. ("we," "our," "keysight" or "the company") became an independent publicly-traded company through the distribution by agilent technologies, inc. ("agilent") of 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of keysight to agilent's shareholders (the "separation"). each agilent shareholder of record as of the close of business on october 22, 2014, received one share of keysight common stock for every two shares of agilent common stock held on the record date. keysight was incorporated in delaware on december 6, 2013 and is comprised of agilent's former electronic measurement business. keysight's registration statement on form 10 was declared effective by the u.s. securities and exchange commission on october 6, 2014. keysight's common stock began trading "regular-way" under the ticker symbol "keys" on the new york stock exchange on november 3, 2014.
our fiscal year end is october 31, and our fiscal quarters end on january 31, april 30 and july 31. unless otherwise stated, all dates refer to our fiscal year and fiscal periods.
prior to the distribution, agilent transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of the electronic measurement business to keysight in august 2014 ("the capitalization"). combined financial statements prior to the capitalization were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from agilent's consolidated financial statements and accounting records. the combined financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k reflect our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of agilent prior to the capitalization. following the capitalization the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. all periods have been accounted for in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
for periods prior to the capitalization, the combined and consolidated financial statements included the allocation of certain assets and liabilities that were historically held at the agilent level but which were specifically identified or allocated to us. cash and cash equivalents held by agilent were not allocated to us. agilent's debt and related interest expense were not allocated to us since we are not the legal obligor of the debt and agilent's borrowings were not directly attributable to us. in addition, prior to the capitalization, all intercompany transactions between us and agilent were considered to be effectively settled at the time the transactions were recorded. all cash generated by our business was assumed to be remitted to the agilent subsidiary located in the same legal entity or country. the total net effect of the settlement of these intercompany transactions prior to the capitalization is reflected in the combined and consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity and in the combined and consolidated balance sheet as agilent net investment.
on october 15, 2014, we issued $500 million of 3.30 percent senior notes due in 2019 and $600 million of 4.55 percent senior notes due in 2024. a portion of the proceeds from the offering was used to make a $900 million cash distribution to agilent in october 2014. we intend to use the remaining proceeds to fund working capital and other liquidity needs.
the combined and consolidated statement of operations includes our direct expenses for cost of products and services sold, research and development, sales and marketing, distribution, and administration as well as allocations of expenses arising from shared services and infrastructure provided by agilent to us. these allocated expenses include costs of information technology, accounting and legal services, real estate and facilities, corporate advertising, insurance services, treasury and other corporate and infrastructure services. in addition, other costs allocated to us include restructuring costs, share-based compensation expense and
28
retirement plan expenses related to agilent's corporate and shared services employees. these expenses are allocated to us using estimates that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by us. these costs have been allocated to us on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro-rata basis of revenue, square footage, headcount or other measures.
we expect agilent to continue to provide some of these services related to these functions on a transitional basis for a fee, which will be partially offset by other income from keysight services provided to agilent. these services will be received or provided under a transition services agreement. we do not expect the net costs associated with the transition services agreement to be materially different than the historical costs that have been allocated to us related to these same services.
we also expect to incur other incremental costs as an independent, publicly traded company as compared to the costs historically allocated to us by agilent. these incremental costs are estimated to be approximately $20 million on an annual pre-tax basis. for the fiscal year 2014, we recognized $78 million of non-recurring transaction and pre-separation costs. we expect to recognize additional non-recurring transaction and separation costs, which are currently estimated to range from $25 million to $30 million through fiscal 2016. these costs are expected to include, among other things, branding, legal, accounting and other advisory fees and other costs to separate and transition from agilent.
overview and executive summary we provide electronic measurement instruments and systems and related software, software design tools, and related services that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronics equipment. related services include start-up assistance, instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair. we also offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer's product lifecycle.
historically, we conducted our business in one reportable operating segment for agilent. in fiscal 2014, in conjunction with the planned separation, we implemented changes in our organizational structure which resulted in the formation of two reportable operating segments, measurement solutions and customer support and services. the measurement solutions segment is primarily the hardware and associated software businesses serving the electronic measurement market. the customer support and services segment provides repair and calibration of the hardware measurement solutions and the resale of used instrument equipment.
years ended october 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012
total orders in 2014 were $2,963 million, an increase of 3 percent when compared to 2013. orders increased in all market segments including aerospace and defense; industrial, computer, and semiconductor test; and communications test. foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the year‐over‐year comparison. orders of $2,866 million in 2013 declined 13 percent when compared to 2012 on declines in all market segments, including aerospace and defense; industrial, computer and semiconductor test; and communications test.
net revenue of $2,933 million in 2014 increased 2 percent when compared to 2013, with industrial, computer and semiconductor test contributing 2 percentage points of the increase, and communication test contributing 1 percentage point of the increase, partially offset by a decline in aerospace and defense revenue. foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the year over year comparison. net revenue of $2,888 million in 2013 declined 13 percent when compared to 2012, with lower communications test revenue contributing 8 percentage points of the decline, and lower industrial, computer and semiconductor test revenue further decreasing revenue by approximately 5 percentage points, while aerospace and defense was flat year over year.
net income was $392 million in 2014 compared to net income of $457 million in 2013 and $841 million in 2012. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, we generated operating cash flows of $563 million, $566 million and $724 million, respectively.
looking forward, while we believe the long-term growth rate of our markets is 3 to 4 percent, we expect lower fiscal 2015 market growth in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 percent. as an independent publicly-traded company, we are focused on growing in our markets while meeting our financial commitments. we intend to leverage our unique formula of hardware plus software plus people to create value for our customers and shareholders.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our combined and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. an accounting policy
29
is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, allocation methods and allocated expenses from agilent, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, restructuring and accounting for income taxes.
revenue recognition.    we enter into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple-element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, for products, or when the service has been provided. revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. for sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. for products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. we allocate revenue to each element in our multiple-element arrangements based upon their relative selling prices. we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy. the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence ("vsoe") if available, third-party evidence ("tpe") if vsoe is not available, or estimated selling price ("esp") if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules. revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements.
we use vsoe of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists. vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately. tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors, it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish tpe. esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis. we determine esp for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including, but not limited to customer type, geography, market conditions, competitive landscape, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by management. we may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future. as these pricing strategies evolve, changes may occur in esp. the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple-element arrangements, which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement.
inventory valuation.    we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.
allocations. agilent allocated certain costs such as share-based compensation expense and retirement and post-retirement benefit plan expense relating to our employees and agilent's corporate and shared services employees. these expenses were subject to certain underlying assumptions mentioned below.
share-based compensation.    prior to the separation, keysight employees participated in agilent's stock program. share-based compensation expense has been allocated to us based on keysight employees participating in agilent's stock plan and our share of agilent's corporate and shared services employee costs based on our share of revenue. agilent accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance where share-based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straight-line basis. the fair value of share-based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the black-scholes option pricing model. shares granted under the long-term performance ("ltp") program were valued using the monte carlo simulation model. the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards is determined
30
based on the market price of agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. the employee stock purchase plan ("espp") allows eligible employees to purchase shares of agilent's common stock at 85 percent of the purchase price and uses the purchase date to establish the fair market value. both the black-scholes and monte carlo simulation fair-value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions used by agilent, including the option's expected life and the price volatility of agilent stock. the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent agilent's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. although we believe the assumptions and estimates made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results.
retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.  prior to the capitalization, substantially all of our employees were covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution retirement plans sponsored by agilent. we have accounted for our employee participation in agilent's defined benefit retirement plans and the post‐retirement health care plan as multiemployer plans. as a result, no asset or liability was recorded by us to recognize the funded status of such plans in our combined and consolidated balance sheet prior to the capitalization. at the capitalization, the assets and liabilities of these plans that were allocable to keysight employees were transferred to keysight plans; therefore, the plans are no longer considered multi-employer plans.
our combined and consolidated statements of operations include expense that has been allocated to us based on keysight employees participating in these plans and our share of agilent's corporate and shared services employee costs. we consider the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable for all periods presented. at capitalization, we established defined benefit retirement and post-retirement plans for our current and former employees. the defined benefit retirement and post- retirement obligations relating to those participants in these plans were transferred from agilent's plans to our defined benefit plans. a proportionate share of the defined benefit plan assets was allocated from the agilent pension trust in each applicable country to a newly established keysight pension trust. subject to local law, it is anticipated that the share of assets allocated to us will be in the same proportion as the projected benefit obligation of our participants to the total projected benefit obligation of agilent.
retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to keysight based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. other important assumptions include, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and investment portfolio composition. we evaluate these assumptions at least annually.
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date, which is october 31 for both u.s. and non-u.s. plans. for 2014, the u.s. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. for 2014, the discount rate for non-u.s. plans was generally based on published rates for high-quality corporate bonds. if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be $4 million on u.s. net periodic benefit cost and $12 million on non-u.s. net periodic benefit cost. lower discount rates increase the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense.
the company uses alternate methods of amortization, as allowed by the authoritative guidance, that amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. for u.s. plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime. for most non-u.s. plans and u.s. post-retirement benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. the expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. plan assets are valued at fair value. if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $7 million on u.s. net periodic benefit cost and $13 million on non-u.s. net periodic benefit cost.
goodwill and other intangible assets. we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. as defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. we aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units. at the time of an acquisition, we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
companies have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether performing the two-step quantitative
31
test is necessary. if an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. > 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. otherwise, no further testing will be required.
the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. these examples include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers. the qualitative indicators replace those previously used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required. if it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. in the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. the second step, if necessary, measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit.
historically we conducted our business in a single operating segment and reporting unit. in fiscal 2014, in conjunction with the planned separation, we implemented changes in our organizational structure which resulted in the formation of two reportable operating segments. in fiscal year 2014, we assessed goodwill impairment for our two reporting units which consisted of our two segments, measurement solutions and customer support and services. we performed a quantitative test of goodwill impairment for both reporting units as of september 30, 2014. based on the results of our testing, the fair value for both reporting units was significantly in excess of the carrying value. there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated.
warranty.    our standard warranty term for most of our products from the date of delivery is typically three years, which increased from one year in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. we accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product revenue. the accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time related product revenue is recognized.
we also sell extended warranties that provide warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty term. revenue associated with extended warranties is deferred and recognized over the extended coverage period.
restructuring.  the main component of our restructuring plan is related to workforce reductions. workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated. if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recorded.
accounting for income taxes.    we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.
significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. when it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. we consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we released the valuation allowance for the majority of our u.s. deferred tax assets. at october 31, 2014, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance for certain u.s. state and foreign deferred tax assets. we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.
we have not provided for all u.s. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings permanently. should we decide to remit this income to the u.s. in a future period, our provision for income taxes will increase materially in that period.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income
32
taxes, for all u.s. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the combined and consolidated statements of operations.
we have calculated our taxes on a separate return basis. however, the amounts recorded are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been reflected in the financial statements had we been an entity that operated independently of agilent. it is possible that we will make different tax accounting elections and assertions, such as the amount of earnings that will be permanently reinvested outside the u.s. following our distribution from agilent. consequently, our future results after our separation from agilent may be materially different from our historical results.
adoption of new pronouncements see note 2, "new accounting pronouncements," to the combined and consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.
restructuring in fiscal 2013, we recognized $15 million of restructuring charges associated with the targeted headcount reduction of approximately 200 regular employees, representing approximately 2 percent of our global workforce. through the end of fiscal 2014, approximately $11 million was paid out under this program for the termination of 145 employees and $3 million of accrual has been reversed related to 40 employees who have been redeployed within the company. as of october 31, 2014, we have a remaining accrual of $1 million and have substantially completed this program.
foreign currency our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. we hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short-term and anticipated basis on our behalf. the result of the hedging has been included in our combined and consolidated statement of operations. we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the combined and consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling twelve- month period). therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. to the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the u.s. dollar cost of the transaction.
prior to the capitalization, we were under agilent's hedging program and none of the financial instruments used in agilent's hedging program were included in our combined and consolidated balance sheet.
results from operations-years ended october 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012
orders and net revenue in general, recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services that will be delivered within six months. revenue reflects the delivery and acceptance of the products and services as defined on the customer's terms and conditions. cancellations are recorded in the period received from the customer and historically have not been material.

total orders increased 3 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. orders increased in all market segments including aerospace and defense; industrial, computer, and semiconductor test; and communications test. foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the year-over-year compare. our orders declined 13 percent in 2013 compared to 2012. orders were lower for all market segments, including aerospace and defense; industrial, computer, and semiconductor test; and communications test.
net revenue of $2,933 million for 2014 increased 2 percent as compared to 2013, with modest growth in industrial, computer and semiconductor test contributing 2 percentage points of the increase, and communication test contributing 1 percentage point of the increase, partially offset by a decline in aerospace and defense revenue. foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the year-over-year compare. revenue from asia pacific, excluding japan, grew 8 percent driven by growth in communication test and industrials, computer and semiconductor test. europe revenue increased 5 percent year-over-year from growth in communications test. americas revenues declined 3 percent year-over-year with lower aerospace and defense and communications test. japan revenues declined 9 percent year-over-year, with declines in all market segments. revenue from products increased 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 while service related revenue was flat. revenue declined 13 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower wireless manufacturing and industrial, computer and semiconductor test demand.
communications test revenue, representing approximately 34 percent of our total revenue, increased year-over-year with increases in wireless manufacturing and broadband communications business, partially offset by modest declines in wireless r&d. wireless manufacturing growth continues to be driven by 4g base station investments, mainly for china. broadband showed solid growth impacted by demand for datacom bandwidth. wireless r&d continues to be affected by cautious customer spending driven by consolidation and restructuring activities throughout the industry, across device, network equipment, chipset and component manufacturers. in 2013, communications test revenue declined compared to 2012 due to significantly lower wireless manufacturing demand and modest declines in wireless r&d.
aerospace and defense business, representing approximately 22 percent of our total revenue, decreased compared to 2013, with declines in all regions, however we saw positive growth in the last half of fiscal 2014. in 2013, aerospace and defense test, representing approximately 23 percent of total revenue, was flat compared to 2012, with lower demand in the americas offset by stronger spending in europe.
industrial, computer and semiconductor test revenue, representing approximately 44 percent of total business, increased year-over-year compared to 2013. the computer and semiconductor increase was driven by investment in capacity growth and the overall strength in the semiconductor market. the industrial test business grew for the year with particular strength in the last fiscal quarter driven by growth in the americas and asia pacific, excluding japan. in 2012, industrial, computer and semiconductor test represented approximately 43 percent of the total business with slight growth in computer and semiconductor business.

backlog backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked, including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers, orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue, and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced, awaiting acceptance by customers.
at october 31, 2014, our unfilled backlog was approximately $781 million as compared to approximately $761 million at october 31, 2013. for the measurement solutions business, our unfilled backlog was approximately $627 million at october 31, 2014 as compared to approximately $563 million at october 31, 2013. within our customer services and support business, our unfilled backlog was approximately $154 million at october 31, 2014 as compared to approximately $198 million at october 31, 2013. the reduction in the customer services and support business backlog in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to a change in our standard warranty term, which increased from one to three years for most of our products in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. revenue associated with extended warranties, which provide coverage beyond the standard warranty term, is deferred and amortized over the extended period of coverage. as a result of the extension of the standard warranty term, backlog associated with extended warranties has declined. three year warranty is now included as part of the total solution, and the value is captured as part of the system sale.
we expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months. on average, our unfilled backlog represents approximately three months' worth of revenue. we believe backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.

gross margin declined 1 percentage point in 2014 compared to 2013 on slightly higher revenue. higher inventory charges and pricing pressure in the wireless manufacturing market were the primary reasons for the lower gross margin. gross margin declined 1 percentage point in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower sales volume, while declines in variable and incentive pay and reduced infrastructure spending were offset by higher excess and obsolete inventory charges, wage increases, acquisition and integration costs, and restructuring expenses.
excess and obsolete inventory charges were $33 million in 2014, $21 million in 2013 and $14 million in 2012. sales of previously written-down inventory were $1 million in each of 2014, 2013 and 2012.
research and development expenses declined 4 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower infrastructure-related expenses. research and development expenses declined 1 percent in 2013 compared to 2012. reductions in development spending, variable and incentive pay, and infrastructure-related expenses, and the favorable impact of currency movements were partially offset by investments in acquisitions and wage increases.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher costs related to non-recurring pre-separation transaction costs and an increase in marketing expenses, partially offset by reductions in infrastructure costs and the favorable impact of currency movements. selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2 percent in 2013 compared to 2012. reductions in discretionary spending, lower variable and incentive pay, and the favorable impact of currency movements were partially offset by wage increases.
operating margins declined 1 percentage point in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily driven by one-time separation costs. operating margins declined by 5 percentage points in 2013 compared to 2012 on lower revenue partially offset by reduced operating expenses. as of october 31, 2014, our headcount was approximately 9,600.

provision (benefit) for income taxes   $83                 $44                 $(95      )
for 2014, the effective tax rate was 18 percent.  the 18 percent effective tax is lower than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings in non-u.s. jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates; in particular singapore, where we enjoyed tax holidays for the first three quarters of 2014, which resulted in a decrease to income tax expense of $40 million. the current year rate was also favorably impacted by a $55 million benefit from a prior year reserve release, which was offset by $62m tax expense as a result of the repatriation of foreign earnings.
for 2013, the effective tax rate was 9 percent. the 9 percent effective tax is lower than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings in non-u.s. jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates; in particular singapore where we enjoy tax holidays.
for 2012, the effective tax rate was 13 percent. the 13 percent effective tax rate reflects tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates and includes a $227 million tax benefit due to the reversal of a valuation allowance for our u.s. federal deferred tax assets. valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. in the fourth quarter of 2012, management concluded that the valuation allowance for our u.s. federal deferred tax assets is no longer needed primarily due to the emergence from cumulative losses in recent years, the return to sustainable u.s. operating profits and the expectation of sustainable profitability in future periods. as of october 31, 2012, the cumulative positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence regarding the likelihood that most of the deferred tax asset for our u.s. combined income tax group will be realized. accordingly, we recognized a non-recurring tax benefit of $227 million in 2012 relating to the valuation allowance reversal. the effective tax rate also included a non-recurring tax expense of $80 million relating to an increase in the overall residual tax expected to be imposed upon the repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings previously considered permanently reinvested. during the fourth quarter of 2012, we assessed the forecasted cash needs and the overall financial position of our foreign subsidiaries and determined that a portion of previously permanently reinvested earnings would no longer be reinvested overseas.
we enjoyed tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in singapore through the third quarter of fiscal 2014, and several jurisdictions have granted or are anticipated to grant us tax incentives that require renewal at various times in the future, most significant being in singapore. the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. the tax holidays are due for renewal between 2015 and 2023. as a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $40 million, $68 million and $96 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all u.s. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the combined and condensed statements of operations.
in the united states, agilent's tax years remain open back to the year 2008 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states. on january 29, 2014 agilent reached an agreement with the irs for the tax years 2006 through 2007 that, in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, resulted in $55 million of tax benefit associated with the recognition of previously unrecognized u.s. federal and state tax benefits and the reversal of the related interest accruals resulting from this agreement. agilent's u.s. federal income tax returns for 2008 through 2011 are currently under audit by the irs. in other major jurisdictions where we conduct business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2003. with these jurisdictions and the united states, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement. given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.

we have calculated our taxes on a separate return basis. however, the amounts recorded are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been reflected in the financial statements had we been an entity that operated independently of agilent. consequently our future results after our separation from agilent may be materially different from our historical results.

financial condition liquidity and capital resources historically, agilent has provided financing, cash management and other treasury services to us. cash transferred to and from agilent has been recorded as intercompany payables and receivables which are reflected in agilent net investment in the accompanying historical combined and consolidated financial statements. we believe our cash generated from operations and our ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, contractual obligations, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.
although the cash generated in the u.s. from future operations, including any cash and non-permanently invested earnings repatriated to the u.s., is expected to cover our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements, a substantial amount of additional cash could be required for other purposes, such as the maturity of our current and future debt obligations, any dividends that may be declared, any future stock repurchase programs and any u.s. acquisitions. if in the future, after our separation from agilent, we encounter a significant need for liquidity domestically or at a particular location that it cannot fulfill through borrowings, equity offerings, or other internal or external sources, we may determine that cash repatriations are necessary. repatriation could result in additional material u.s. federal and state income tax payments in future years. such adverse consequences would occur, for example, if the transfer of cash into the u.s. is taxed and no foreign tax credit is available to offset the u.s. tax liability, resulting in higher taxes. these factors may cause us to have an overall tax rate higher than our tax rates have been in the past. we utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.
our financial position as of october 31, 2014 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $810 million as compared to zero as of october 31, 2013. cash of approximately $74 million, which amount is subject to final determination as provided in the separation and distribution agreement, will be returned to agilent. as of october 31, 2014, approximately $598 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside of the u.s. in our foreign subsidiaries.
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $563 million in 2014 as compared to $566 million provided in 2013 and $724 million provided in 2012. agilent paid most taxes and pension contributions on our behalf. we paid net taxes of approximately $4 million in 2014.
in 2014, accounts receivable used cash of $25 million, provided cash of $44 million in 2013 and used cash of $3 million in 2012. days' sales outstanding were 44 days in 2014, 42 days in 2013 and 43 days in 2012. accounts payable provided cash of $32 million in 2014, used cash of $24 million in 2013 and used cash of $23 million in 2012. cash used in inventory was $31 million in 2014, $53 million in 2013 and $46 million in 2012. inventory days on-hand decreased to 137 days in 2014 compared to 143 days in 2013 and 118 days in 2012. the increase in days on-hand between 2013 and 2012 was due to the reduced shipment volume within our business.
agilent contributed $15 million on our behalf to our u.s. multi-employer plans in each of 2014, 2013 and 2012. agilent contributed $41 million, $45 million and $30 million to our non-u.s. multi-employer plans in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. there were no contributions to the u.s. multi-employer post-retirement health care plan for the years ended october 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. at the capitalization, the assets and liabilities of these plans that were allocable to keysight employees were transferred to keysight plans; therefore, the plans are no longer considered multi-employer plans.
net cash provided by/used in investing activities
39
net cash used in investing activities in 2014 was $82 million as compared to net cash used of $85 million in 2013 and $172 million in 2012.
purchases of property, plant and equipment were $70 million in 2014, $69 million in 2013 and $103 million in 2012. acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets were $11 million in 2014, $1 million in 2013 and $69 million in 2012. in 2012 we acquired two businesses for $44 million along with some smaller acquisitions. we purchased investments of $15 million in 2013, as compared to zero in 2014 and 2012. proceeds from the sale of investment securities were zero in each of the fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012.
net cash provided by/used in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was $335 million compared to $481 million used in 2013 and $552 million used in 2012, respectively. we issued senior notes of $1.1 billion and made a repayment of capital of $940 million to agilent in the year ended october 31, 2014.
credit facility on september 15, 2014, we entered into a five-year credit agreement, which provides for a $300 million unsecured credit facility that will expire on november 1, 2019. the company may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes. as of october 31, 2014, the company has no borrowings outstanding under the facility. we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility during the year ended october 31, 2014.
short-term debt on july 10, 2014, our wholly owned subsidiary in india entered into a short-term loan agreement with a financial institution, which provided up to $50 million of unsecured borrowings. on july 25, 2014, we borrowed $35 million against the loan agreement at an interest rate of 9.95 percent per annum. the loan was repaid during the year and as of october 31, 2014, no balance was outstanding.
long-term debt in october 2014, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes ("2019 senior notes"). the 2019 senior notes were issued at 99.902% of their principal amount. the notes will mature on october 30, 2019, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.30% per annum. the interest is payable semi-annually on april 30 and october 30 of each year, commencing on april 30, 2015.
in october 2014, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes ("2024 senior notes"). the 2024 senior notes were issued at 99.966% of their principal amount. the notes will mature on october 30, 2024, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.55% per annum. the interest is payable semi-annually on april 30 and october 30 of each year, commencing on april 30, 2015.
off balance sheet arrangements and other we have contractual commitments for non-cancellable operating leases. see note 17, "commitments and contingencies," to our combined and consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancellable operating leases.
our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.
contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. as a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.

operating leases.    commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property, see note 17, "commitments and contingencies."
interest on senior notes.    we have contractual obligations for interest payments on our senior notes. interest rates and payment dates are detailed above under "long-term debt."
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers.    we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. during the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. however, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are non-cancellable. therefore, approximately 86% percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, non-cancellable, and unconditional commitments. we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year.
in addition to the above-mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers, we record a liability for firm, non-cancellable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. as of october 31, 2014, the liability for our excess firm, non-cancellable and unconditional purchase commitments was $5 million, compared to $5 million as of october 31, 2013 and $4 million as of october 31, 2012. these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our combined and consolidated balance sheet.
retirement plans.    commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our non-u.s. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans for the next year only. contributions after next year are impractical to estimate.
other purchase commitments. other purchase commitments relate to contracts with professional services suppliers. typically we can cancel these contracts within 90 days without penalties. for those contracts that are not cancellable within 90 days without penalties, we are disclosing the amounts we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contract in that period before such contract can be canceled. as of october 31, 2014, our contractual obligations with these suppliers are approximately $33 million within the next fiscal year, as compared to approximately $26 million as of october 31, 2013. the increase is due to additional contracts associated with our pre-separation expenditures and additional contracts put in place related to our operational separation from agilent on august 1, 2014.
we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of october 31, 2014 or october 31, 2013.
on balance sheet arrangements. the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations recorded in our combined and consolidated balance sheet pertaining to our long-term debt as of october 31, 2014 (in millions):
less than oneyear       one to three years         three to five years        more than five years senior notes   $-                      $-                         $500                       $600
other long-term liabilities include $82 million and $92 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31, 2014 and october 31, 2013, respectively. we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. however, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement.

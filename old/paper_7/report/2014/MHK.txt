index to financial statements carpet segment-operating income was $209.0 million (7.0% of segment net sales) for 2013 reflecting an increase of $50.8 million, or 32.1%, compared to operating income of $158.2 million (5.4% of segment net sales) for 2012. the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to operations productivity of approximately $38 million, the favorable net impact of price and product mix of approximately $33 million, and higher sales volume of approximately $9 million, partially offset by higher input costs of approximately $29 million.
ceramic segment-operating income was $209.8 million (7.8% of segment net sales) for 2013 reflecting an increase of $88.9 million, or 73.5%, compared to operating income of $121.0 million (7.5% of segment net sales) for 2012. the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to volume increases of approximately $161 million that were predominately driven by the marazzi acquisition, the favorable net impact of price and product mix of approximately $21 million and operations productivity of approximately $15 million, partially offset by higher restructuring and integration-related costs of approximately $37 million, inventory step-up related to the marazzi acquisition of approximately $31 million, increases in selling, general and administrative costs of approximately $17 million primarily attributable to sales volume increases and market expansion opportunities in the legacy business and higher input costs of approximately $15 million.
laminate and wood segment-operating income was $159.4 million (8.9% of segment net sales) for 2013 reflecting an increase of $33.0 million, or 26.1%, compared to operating income of $126.4 million (9.4% of segment net sales) for 2012. the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to higher sales volume of approximately $40 million predominately driven by the pergo and spano acquisitions, lower amortization expense of approximately $34 million, increases in operations productivity of approximately $30 million, partially offset by higher restructuring and integration-related costs of approximately $53 million and higher input costs of approximately $15 million.
interest expense interest expense was $92.2 million for 2013, reflecting an increase of $17.5 million compared to interest expense of $74.7 million for 2012. the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to increased borrowings related to the three acquisitions, partially offset by lower interest rates on the company's outstanding debt attributable to the shift from the higher interest rate senior 7.20% notes to the 2011 senior credit facility and the positive effect of the ratings upgrades on interest associated with the 6.125% notes.
other expense other expense was $9.1 million for 2013, reflecting a change of $8.8 million compared to other expense of $0.3 million for 2012. the change was primarily attributable to net change in foreign currency gains/losses.
income tax expense for 2013, the company recorded income tax expense of $78.4 million on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of $445.6 million for an effective tax rate of 17.6%, as compared to an income tax expense of $53.6 million on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of $304.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 17.6% for 2012.
loss from discontinued operations, net of income tax benefit for 2013, the company recorded a loss from discontinued operations, net of income tax benefit of $17.9 million as discussed in note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources the company's primary capital requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. the company's capital needs are met primarily through a combination of internally generated funds, commercial paper, bank credit lines, term and senior notes and credit terms from suppliers.
net cash flows provided by operating activities for 2014 were $662.2 million compared to $525.2 million provided by operating activities for 2013. the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to higher earnings, lower restructuring charges, partially offset by changes in working capital.
net cash used in investing activities for 2014 was $565.7 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $810.0 million for 2013. the decrease was primarily attributable to acquisitions of $443.5 million in the prior year, partially offset by higher capital expenditures of $195.3 million in the current year.
25
index to financial statements net cash used in financing activities for 2014 was $25.6 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $106.8 million for 2013. the change in cash used in financing as compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to net proceeds from commercial paper of $302 million and $200 million in proceeds from asset securitization borrowings, partially offset by repayments of the senior notes of $254 million and $165 million of net payments of the senior credit facility.
commercial paper on february 28, 2014, the company entered into definitive documentation to establish a commercial paper program for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the united states capital markets. under the program, the company may issue commercial paper notes from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,000.0 million outstanding at any time, subject to availability under the 2013 senior credit facility, which the company uses as a liquidity backstop. the commercial paper notes will have maturities ranging from one day to 397 days and will not be subject to voluntary prepayment by the company or redemption prior to maturity. the commercial paper notes will rank pari passu with all of the company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
the proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes will be available for general corporate purposes. the company used the initial proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes to repay borrowings under its 2013 senior credit facility and certain of its industrial revenue bonds. as of december 31, 2014, the amount utilized under the commercial paper program was $301.6 million with a weighted-average interest rate and maturity period of 0.70% and 52 days, respectively.
senior credit facility on september 25, 2013, the company entered into a $1,000.0 million, 5-year, senior revolving credit facility (the "2013 senior credit facility"). the 2013 senior credit facility provides for a maximum of $1,000.0 million of revolving credit, including limited amounts of credit in the form of letters of credit and swingline loans and serves as a backstop to the company's commercial paper program. the company paid financing costs of $1.8 million in connection with its 2013 senior credit facility. these costs were deferred and, along with unamortized costs of $11.4 million related to the company's 2011 credit facility, are being amortized over the term of the 2013 senior credit facility.
at the company's election, revolving loans under the 2013 senior credit facility bear interest at annual rates equal to either (a) libor for 1, 2, 3 or 6 month periods, as selected by the company, plus an applicable margin ranging between 1.00% and 1.75%, or (b) the higher of the wells fargo bank, national association prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and a monthly libor rate plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin ranging between 0.00% and 0.75%. the company also pays a commitment fee to the lenders under the 2013 senior credit facility on the average amount by which the aggregate commitments of the lenders' exceed utilization of the 2013 senior credit facility ranging from 0.125% to 0.25% per annum. the applicable interest rate and the commitment fee are determined based on whichever of the company's consolidated net leverage ratio or its senior unsecured debt rating (or if not available, corporate family rating) results in the lower applicable margins and commitment fee (with applicable margins and the commitment fee increasing as that ratio increases or those ratings decline, as applicable).
the obligations of the company and its subsidiaries in respect of the 2013 senior credit facility are unsecured.
if at any time (a) both (i) the moody's rating is ba2 and (ii) the s&p rating is bb, (b) (i) the moody's rating is ba3 or lower and (ii) the s&p rating is below bbb- (with a stable outlook or better) or (c) (i) the moody's rating is below baa3 (with a stable outlook or better) and (ii) the s&p rating is bb- or lower, the obligations of the company and the other borrowers under the 2013 senior credit facility will be required to be guaranteed by all of the company's material domestic subsidiaries and all obligations of borrowers that are foreign subsidiaries will be required to be guaranteed by those foreign subsidiaries of the company which the company designates as guarantors.
the 2013 senior credit facility includes certain affirmative and negative covenants that impose restrictions on the company's financial and business operations, including limitations on liens, indebtedness, investments, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, dividends and other similar restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, payments and modifications of certain existing debt, future negative pledges, and changes in the nature of the company's business. many of these limitations are subject to numerous exceptions. the company is also required to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a consolidated net leverage ratio of no more than 3.75 to 1.0, each as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.
26
index to financial statements the 2013 senior credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, subject to customary grace periods.
the 2013 senior credit facility is scheduled to mature on september 25, 2018. however, the maturity date will accelerate, resulting in the acceleration of any unamortized deferred financing costs, to october 16, 2015, if on that date any of the company's 6.125% notes due january 15, 2016 remains outstanding and the company has not delivered to the administrative agent a certificate demonstrating that, after giving pro forma effect to the repayment in cash in full on that date of all of the 6.125% notes that remain outstanding, the amount the company would be permitted to draw under the 2013 senior credit facility, together with the aggregate consolidated amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of the company, would exceed $200.0 million.  while there can be no assurance, the company currently believes that if any of the 6.125% notes remains outstanding on october 16, 2015, the amount the company would be permitted to draw under the 2013 senior credit facility, together with the aggregate consolidated amount of the company's unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, will exceed $200.0 million on october 16, 2015.
as of december 31, 2014, amounts utilized under the facility included $195.7 million of borrowings and $37.4 million of standby letters of credit related to various insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments. the company also considers the outstanding borrowings of $301.6 million as of december 31, 2014 under its commercial paper program to be a reduction of the available capacity. taking the commercial paper borrowings into consideration, the company has utilized $534.6 million under the 2013 senior credit facility resulting in a total of $465.4 million available under the 2013 senior credit facility.
senior notes on january 31, 2013, the company issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.85% senior notes due february 1, 2023. the company paid financing costs of $6.0 million in connection with the 3.85% senior notes. these costs were deferred and are being amortized over the term of the 3.85% senior notes.
on january 17, 2006, the company issued $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% notes due january 15, 2016. interest payable on these notes is subject to adjustment if either moody's or s&p, or both, upgrades or downgrades the rating assigned to the company. each rating agency downgrade results in a 0.25% increase in the interest rate, subject to a maximum increase of 1% per rating agency. if later the rating of these notes improves, then the interest rates would be reduced accordingly. each 0.25% increase in the interest rate of these notes would increase the company's interest expense by approximately $0.1 million per quarter per $100.0 million of outstanding notes. the current rate in effect is 6.125%. any future downgrades in the company's credit ratings could increase the cost of its existing credit and adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future.
on august 15, 2014, the company purchased for cash approximately $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 6.125% senior notes due january 15, 2016 at a price equal to 107.73% of the principal amount, resulting in a premium to redeeming noteholders of approximately $15.5 million. the premium as well as the fees of $1.1 million associated with the redemption are included in interest expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations as at december 31, 2014.
on november 3, 2014, the company purchased for cash approximately $54.4 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 6.125% senior notes due january 15, 2016 at a price equal to 106.38% of the principal amount, resulting in a premium to redeeming noteholders of approximately $3.5 million. the premium is included in interest expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations on the condensed consolidated statement of operations as at december 31, 2014.
accounts receivable securitization on december 19, 2012, the company entered into a three-year on-balance sheet trade accounts receivable securitization agreement (the "securitization facility"). on september 11, 2014, the company made certain modifications to its securitization facility, which modifications, among other things, increased the aggregate borrowings available under the facility from $300.0 million to $500.0 million and decreased the interest margins on certain borrowings. under the terms of the securitization facility, certain subsidiaries of the company sell at a discount certain of their trade accounts receivable (the "receivables") to mohawk factoring, llc ("factoring") on a revolving basis. factoring is a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary of the company, meaning that factoring is a separate legal entity whose assets are available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of factoring only, not the creditors of the company or the company's other subsidiaries.  to fund such purchases, factoring may borrow up to $500.0 million based on the amount of eligible receivables owned by factoring, and factoring has granted a security interest in all of such receivables to the third-party lending group as collateral for such borrowings.  amounts loaned to factoring under the securitization facility bear interest at commercial paper interest rates, in the case of lenders that are commercial paper conduits,
27
index to financial statements or libor, in the case of lenders that are not commercial paper conduits, in each case, plus an applicable margin of 0.70% per annum. factoring also pays a commitment fee at a per annum rate of 0.35% on the unused amount of each lender's commitment.
at december 31, 2014, the amount utilized under the securitization facility was $500.0 million.
the company may continue, from time to time, to retire its outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. the amount involved may be material.
as of december 31, 2014, the company had cash of $97.9 million, of which $76.8 million was held outside the united states. while the company's plans are to permanently reinvest the cash held outside the united states, the estimated cost of repatriation for the cash as of december 31, 2014 was approximately $26.9 million. the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash generated from operations and availability under its 2013 senior credit facility will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure, working capital and debt servicing requirements over the next twelve months.
the company's board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 15 million shares of the company's outstanding common stock. since the inception of the program in 1999, a total of approximately 11.5 million shares have been repurchased at an aggregate cost of approximately $335.5 million. all of these repurchases have been financed through the company's operations and banking arrangements. for the year ended december 31, 2014, the company repurchased approximately 2 thousand shares at an average price of $139.92 per share in connection with the exercise of stock options under the company's 2012 incentive plan. for the year ended december 31, 2013, the company repurchased approximately 1 thousand shares at an average price of $123.16 per share in connection with the exercise of stock options under the company's 2012 incentive plan.

critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. in reaching such decisions, the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience. actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.
the company's significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates. critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies.
•   accounts receivable and revenue recognition. revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the price has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability can be reasonably assured. the company provides allowances for expected cash discounts, sales allowances, returns, claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable. if the financial condition of the company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. a 10% change in the company's allowance for discounts, returns, claims and doubtful accounts would have affected net earnings by approximately $4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
•   inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value). cost has been determined using the first-in first-out method ("fifo"). costs included in inventory include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and employee benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing. market, with respect to all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value. inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence. actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory, excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required. a 10% change in the company's reserve for excess or obsolete inventory would have affected net earnings by approximately $6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
•   goodwill and other intangibles. goodwill is tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. the company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. the goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches. the company has identified carpet, ceramic, laminate and wood flooring, laminate and wood chipboard and melamine, and laminate and wood roofing as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments. the valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital ("wacc"), and comparable company market multiples. when developing these key judgments and assumptions, the company considers economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit. however, estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management's reasonable expectations regarding future developments. these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. should a significant or prolonged deterioration
29
index to financial statements in economic conditions occur, such as declines in spending for new construction, remodeling and replacement activities; the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a decline in comparable company market multiples, then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted. generally, a decline in estimated after tax cash flows of more than 23% or a more than 15% increase in wacc or a significant or prolonged decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment.
the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows. these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above.
the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, which for the company are its trademarks, is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows. the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans. such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks. estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things.
the company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the company are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable. recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups. if such asset groups are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.

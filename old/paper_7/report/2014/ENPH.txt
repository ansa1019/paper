item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations and involves risks and uncertainties. in some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "intend," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. for example, statements regarding our expectations as to future financial performance, expense levels and liquidity sources are forward-looking statements. our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and those discussed in the section entitled "risk factors" and elsewhere in this report.
overview we deliver microinverter technology for the solar industry that increases energy production, simplifies design and installation, improves system uptime and reliability, reduces fire safety risk and provides a platform for intelligent energy management. we were founded in march 2006 and have grown rapidly to become the market leader in the microinverter category. since our first commercial shipment in mid-2008, we have sold over 7.2 million microinverters as of december 31, 2014, which represents over 1.6 gigawatt (ac) of solar pv generating capacity. we currently offer microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states, canada, the united kingdom, france, the benelux region, certain other european markets, australia and new zealand.
we sell our microinverter systems primarily to distributors who resell them to solar installers. we also sell directly to large installers and through original equipment manufacturers ("oems") and strategic partners. historically, revenues generated from the u.s. market have represented more than 80% of our total revenues, with the remainder from canada, europe and asia pacific region.
we have experienced significant revenue growth since our first commercial shipment in mid-2008. our net revenues were $343.9 million, $232.8 million and $216.7 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which reflects deeper market penetration and broader acceptance of microinverter technology. we incurred net losses of $8.1 million, $25.9 million and $38.2 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, as we continued to invest substantial resources to support the growth of our business, including marketing and developing our products, expanding into new product markets and geographies, maintaining and enhancing our research and development operations and personnel-related costs due to growth in headcount. our full-time employee headcount has grown from 384 at december 31, 2012 to 539 at december 31, 2014.
recent operating results in 2014, we grew our revenues, improved gross margin and operating margin and improved cash flows provided by operating activities.
we grew our net revenues to $343.9 million in 2014, as compared to $232.8 million in 2013, representing an increase of $111.1 million or 48%. our net loss was $8.1 million in 2014, as compared to a net loss of $25.9 million in 2013, representing a decrease of $17.8 million or 69%. we generated cash flows from operations of $24.2 million in 2014 compared to approximately break-even in 2013.
components of consolidated statements of operations net revenues we generate net revenues from sales of our microinverter systems, which include microinverter units, an envoy communications gateway device, and our enlighten web-based monitoring service. we sell to distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners.
our revenue is affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our microinverter systems, driven by supply and demand, sales incentives, and competitive product offerings. our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to develop and introduce new products to meet the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers, the diversification and expansion of our revenue base, and our ability to market our products in a manner that increases awareness for microinverter technology and differentiates us in the marketplace.

cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues is comprised primarily of product costs, warranty, manufacturing personnel and logistics costs, freight costs, depreciation and amortization of test equipment and hosting services costs. our product costs are impacted by technological innovations, such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions, economies of scale resulting in lower component costs, and improvements in production processes and automation. certain costs, primarily personnel and depreciation and amortization of test equipment, are not directly affected by sales volume.
we outsource our manufacturing to third-party contract manufacturers and generally negotiate product pricing with them on a quarterly basis. we believe our contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the growing demand for our products for the foreseeable future. however, shortages in the supply of certain key raw materials could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products.
in addition, third parties, including one of our contract manufacturers, serve as our logistics providers by warehousing and delivering our products in north america, europe, australia and new zealand.
gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices, product cost, product mix, warranty costs (including changes in estimates) and sales volume fluctuations resulting from seasonality.
operating expenses operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, recruiting costs, sales commissions, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation. we expect personnel costs to continue to increase as we hire new employees to support our anticipated growth. we expect that each of the categories of operating expenses discussed below will increase in absolute dollars, but will decline as a percentage of total revenues in the long term.
research and development expense includes personnel-related expenses such as salaries, incentive compensation, stock-based compensation and employee benefits. research and development employees are engaged in the design and development of power electronics, semiconductors, powerline communications and networking and software functionality. research and development expense also includes third-party design and development costs, testing and evaluation costs, depreciation expense and other indirect costs. we devote substantial resources in ongoing research and development programs that focus on enhancements to and cost efficiencies in our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation to drive down product costs, improve functionality, and enhance reliability. we intend to continue to invest substantial resources in our research and development efforts because we believe they are critical to maintaining our competitive position.
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses such as salaries, commissions, incentive compensation, stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel. it also includes trade shows, marketing, customer support and other indirect costs. we expect to continue to make the necessary investments to enable us to execute our strategy to increase our market penetration geographically and enter into new markets by expanding our customer base of distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners. historically, substantially all of our sales have been in the united states and canada. we began selling into france, italy and the benelux region in the fourth quarter of 2011 and commenced volume shipments to such regions in the second quarter of 2012. in addition, we opened a sales office in the united kingdom during the second quarter of 2012 and began shipping products to the united kingdom in the third quarter of 2012. in late 2013, we expanded into the australia and new zealand markets by opening a sales office in australia. we expect to continue to expand the geographic reach of our product offerings and explore new sales channels in addressable markets in the future.
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries, incentive compensation, stock-based compensation and employee benefits for personnel related to our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations. general and administrative expense also includes facilities costs and fees for professional services. professional services consist primarily of outside legal, accounting and information technology consulting costs.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net includes interest expense on amounts outstanding under our term loans, convertible note facility and non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs. other income (expense), net also includes gains or losses upon conversion of non-u.s. dollar transactions into u.s. dollars and from foreign currency forward contracts.
31
provision for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we sell our products. historically, we have primarily been subject to taxation in the united states because we have sold the vast majority of our products to customers in the united states. as we have expanded the sale of products to customers outside the united states, we have become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place. as sales in foreign jurisdictions increase in the future, our effective tax rate may fluctuate accordingly. due to the history of losses the company has generated in the united states since inception, the company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that all of its u.s. and state deferred tax assets will not be realized as of december 31, 2014.

2014 compared to 2013. net revenues increased by 48% to $343.9 million in 2014, as compared to 2013. the increase in net revenues was primarily driven by sales of our fourth generation microinverter, which was launched in mid-2013, and continued strength in our core u.s. residential market. the number of microinverter units sold increased by 59% from 1,625,000 units in 2013 to 2,580,000 units in 2014. revenues grew year-over year at a slightly slower pace than units shipped due to a decline in the average selling price, which was consistent with trends in the solar industry.
2013 compared to 2012. net revenues increased by 7% to $232.8 million in 2013, as compared to 2012. the increase in net revenues was primarily due to the increase in microinverter units shipped as well as a larger mix of microinverter accessories. the number of microinverter units sold increased by 8% from 1,510,000 units in 2012 to 1,625,000 units in 2013. substantially all units shipped in both years consisted of our third generation product. revenues grew year-over year at a slightly slower pace than units shipped due a decline in the average selling price, which was consistent with trends in the solar industry.

2014 compared to 2013. cost of revenues increased by 40% in 2014, as compared to 2013, while net revenues increased by 48%. the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of microinverter units sold to customers, consistent with the overall increase in net revenues as described above. gross margin increased by 3.9 percentage points to 32.9% in 2014, as compared to 29.0% in 2013. contributing to the increase was a larger proportion of sales from our higher-margin fourth generation microinverters sold in 2014 as compared to 2013. also contributing to the increase in gross margin was lower warranty expense in 2014 as compared to 2013. warranty expense, as a percentage of net revenues, decreased from 7.1% in 2013 to 3.6% in 2014 primarily due to a decrease in incremental provisions (as a percentage of net revenues) for changes in estimates. in 2014, incremental provisions for changes in estimates represented 2.4% of net revenues, as compared to 4.4% in 2013. in addition, our election to measure warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since january 1, 2014 at fair value improved gross margin by 1.5 percentage points. see note 7, "warranty obligations" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
2013 compared to 2012. cost of revenues increased by 3% in 2013, as compared to 2012, while net revenues increased by 7 %. the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of microinverter units sold to customers, consistent with the overall increase in net revenues as described above. gross margin increased by 3.5 percentage points to 29.0% in 2013, as compared to 25.5% in 2012, primarily due to a lower cost per microinverter unit and larger mix of sales from microinverter accessories. while our third generation product represented substantially all of 2013 and 2012 sales, we were able to achieve lower per unit costs in 2013, as compared to 2012, due to production efficiencies gained through experience with the manufacturing process, which had a favorable impact on gross margin. costs of revenues in 2013 and 2012 included warranty expense of $10.3 million and $7.6 million, respectively, resulting from net changes in estimates, which reduced gross margin by approximately 4.4 and 3.5 percentage points, respectively. see note 7, "warranty obligations" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

2014 compared to 2013. sales and marketing expenses increased by $9.9 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. this increase was primarily due to a 30% increase in sales and marketing headcount, which resulted in increased expense of $9.1 million from salaries, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation. in addition, increased marketing activities mostly from trade shows and use of outside consultants contributed $1.3 million to the increase. the increase was partially offset by $0.5 million in bad debt recoveries.
2013 compared to 2012. sales and marketing expenses increased by $5.1 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to increases in customer service headcount and operations in domestic and international markets. personnel-related costs increased by $4.0 million, which included a $0.6 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation. costs associated with establishing our presence in australia contributed an additional $1.8 million to the increase in 2013. the increase was partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses primarily attributable to lower expenditures on trade shows of $0.6 million.

2014 compared to 2013. general and administrative expenses increased by $7.1 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. this increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs of $4.6 million related to modest headcount growth and increases in incentive and stock-based compensation for existing employees. in addition, an increase in the use of outside consultants including advisory services for our secondary offering and acquisition contributed $1.6 million to the increase. the remaining increase was attributable to facilities-related costs, information technology costs and other general corporate expenses.
2013 compared to 2012. general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.9 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily as a result of decreased use of outside consultants and professional services.

2014 compared to 2013. other expense remained flat at $2.9 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and primarily consisted of interest expense and foreign currency transaction losses. in december 2014, we recorded $0.3 million of interest expense related to the write-off of deferred financing costs and the unaccrued portion of the end of term fee in connection with the voluntary prepayment of our term loan with hercules technology growth capital, inc.
2013 compared to 2012. other expense decreased by $3.5 million in 2013 as compared to 2012. the decrease was primarily attributable to the $2.8 million charge recorded as interest expense in 2012 upon conversion of our convertible facility at our ipo. in addition, interest expense related to outstanding debt balances was lower in 2013, as compared to 2012, due to lower average debt levels.
34
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2014, we had $42.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. cash and cash equivalents held in the united states were $37.0 million and consisted primarily of non-interest bearing checking deposits, with the remainder held in various foreign subsidiaries.
the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):

cash flows from operating activities for 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $24.2 million. our net loss of $8.1 million was more than offset by non-cash charges and net changes in operating assets and liabilities. non-cash charges included $9.7 million of stock-based compensation, $8.3 million of depreciation and amortization and $1.4 million of other non-cash charges. in addition, cash provided by net changes in operating assets and liabilities was $12.8 million.
sources of cash totaled $34.1 million resulting from an increase of $25.3 million in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities, an increase of $5.3 million in deferred revenues and an increase of $3.5 million in warranty obligations. the increases in accounts payable, deferred revenues and warranty obligations were primarily attributable to higher sales volume and inventory purchases. accrued and other liabilities increased primarily due to amounts due under our annual incentive compensation plan.
uses of cash included a $13.7 million increase in accounts receivable, a $5.0 million increase in inventory and a $2.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. the increases were primarily attributable to higher sales volume and higher inventory requirements to support anticipated year-over-year sales growth in the first quarter of 2015.
for 2013, net cash used in operating activities was $0.9 million. our net loss of $25.9 million was substantially offset by non-cash charges and net changes in operating assets and liabilities. non-cash items included $7.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $6.9 million of stock-based compensation, a provision for doubtful accounts of $0.7 million and $0.4 million of non-cash interest expense. in addition, cash provided by net changes in operating assets and liabilities was $10.0 million.
for 2012, net cash used in operating activities was $44.6 million primarily resulting from a net loss of $38.2 million. the net loss was partially offset by non-cash items including, depreciation and amortization of $5.6 million, stock-based compensation of $4.8 million and interest expense of $4.8 million. in addition, the effect of changes in net operating assets and liabilities resulted in the use of cash totaling $22.2 million.
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to capital expenditures to support our growth.
for 2014, net cash used in investing activities of $16.5 million included purchases of test and assembly equipment and the development of software for internal use. in addition, we acquired substantially all of the assets of next phase solar, inc. ("nps") for an initial cash consideration of $2.5 million, which includes $0.3 million being held back to cover indemnification obligations of the selling party and recorded as restricted cash. in a separate transaction, we purchased certain patents related to system interconnection and photovoltaic ac module construction for $0.8 million.
for 2013, net cash used in investing activities of $6.3 million included purchases of test and assembly equipment and the development of software for internal use.
for 2012, net cash used in investing activities of $13.0 million included purchases of test equipment and expenditures on leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures in connection with our relocation to a new headquarter facility.
35
cash flows from financing activities for 2014, net cash used in financing activities consisted of $8.7 million related to repayment of all outstanding principal under our term loan and equipment financing facility, offset by $5.4 million received from common stock issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans.
for 2013, net cash used by financing activities was insignificant. cash received from common stock issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans was $2.4 million. these inflows of cash were offset by principal repayments of term loans of $2.4 million.
for 2012, net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of net proceeds of $56.4 million received from our ipo, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs paid during 2012. cash used in financing activities consisted of $14.1 million in principal repayments of term loans and $1.0 million in financing costs associated with entering into new credit facilities in november 2012. this was partially offset by $10.0 million in proceeds from term loan borrowings.
debt and revolving credit facility we ended 2014 with no debt and $42.0 million of cash and cash equivalents. as of and for the year ended december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants under our credit facility.
revolving credit facility we have a $50.0 million revolving credit facility (the "revolver") with wells fargo bank, n.a. ("wells fargo") that was entered into in november 2012 and subsequently amended in february 2014 to extend the maturity date to november 2016. the amount of loans available to be drawn under the revolver is subject to a borrowing base calculation that limits availability to a percentage of eligible domestic accounts receivable plus a percentage of the value of eligible domestic inventory, less certain reserves. loans under the revolver bear interest in cash at an annual rate equal to, at our option, either libor or a "base rate" that is comprised of, among other things, the prime rate, plus a margin that is between 1.5% and 4.25% depending on the currency borrowed and the specific term of repayment. the revolver contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, and requires us to maintain at least $15.0 million of liquidity at all times, of which at least $5.0 million must be undrawn availability. to date, we have not drawn on the revolver and approximately $37.6 million was available for borrowing as of december 31, 2014 based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances pursuant to the agreement.
full repayment of term loan on november 7, 2012, we entered into a loan and security agreement ("loan agreement") with hercules technology growth capital, inc. ("hercules") and made an initial draw of $7.4 million. in addition, the loan agreement provided $15.6 million in additional borrowing capacity, which expired undrawn on march 31, 2014. borrowings under the loan agreement bore interest at an annual rate equal to the higher of (i) the prime rate plus 8.25% or (b) 11.5%. payments for the first 15 months were for interest-only and equal monthly payments thereafter through the maturity date of august 1, 2016 were for interest and principal. the loan agreement included a fixed $0.6 million back-end fee due on the earlier of prepayment in full or upon expiration of the loan agreement. borrowings under the loan agreement were secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets other than intellectual property. the loan agreement did not include any financial covenants.
on december 8, 2014, we repaid all of the $5.8 million in outstanding indebtedness including accrued interest and related fees thereon and terminated the loan agreement, which was scheduled to mature on august 1, 2016.
full repayment of equipment financing facility on june 13, 2011, we entered into a $5.0 million equipment financing facility with hercules with a three year term. borrowings under the equipment financing facility had a variable interest rate set at the higher of 5.75% above the prime lending rate and 9.0% annually. borrowings were secured by the financed equipment and restricts our ability to pay dividends and take on certain types of additional liens. on july 1, 2014, the equipment financing facility expired in accordance with its terms and all remaining amounts outstanding were repaid in full.

operating and capital expenditure requirements our future capital requirements may vary materially in the future and will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and other costs necessary to support our strategy.
we believe our current cash and cash equivalents of $42.0 million as of december 31, 2014, together with borrowings expected to be available under our revolver with wells fargo, will be adequate to fund our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements over the next 12 months.
if additional sources of liquidity were needed, we may consider new debt or equity offerings, but there is no assurance that such transactions could be consummated on acceptable terms or at all. failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december 31, 2014:
payments due by period total               less than 1 year            1-3 years             4-5 years             more than 5 years

operating leases                            15,074              1,980                       4,038                 4,005                 5,051
purchase commitments under agreements (1)   36,804              36,804                      -                     -                     -

(1)   represents amounts associated with our contract manufacturers that are non-cancelable. such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product. the timing and amount of payments represent our best estimate and may change due to changing business needs and other factors. obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.
we have a contingent consideration arrangement which requires us to pay additional cash payments to the selling party of our business acquisition based on certain defined 2015 and 2016 revenue targets. the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement at december 31, 2014 was $2.3 million. amounts are payable in early 2016 and 2017. depending on the attainment of the specified targets, the potential payment for each year ranges from zero to $2.8 million. as a result, the contingent consideration arrangement has not been included in the table above.
as of december 31, 2014, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, including associated interest and penalties, was approximately $0.7 million. since the ultimate amount and timing of cash settlements cannot be predicted due to the high degree of uncertainty, liabilities for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the contractual obligations table. see note 13, "income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2014 , we did not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k.
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
37
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
for a description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements. an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we generate revenue from sales of our microinverter systems, which include microinverter units and related accessories, an envoy communications gateway device, and an enlighten web-based monitoring service, to distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners. enlighten service revenue represented less than 1% of the total revenues for all periods presented.
revenues from sales of microinverters and related accessories, and communication gateways are recognized when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery of the products has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer; (iii) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. provisions for rebates, sales incentives, and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded.
sales of an envoy communications gateway device include the enlighten web-based monitoring service. the allocation of revenue between the two deliverables is based on our best estimate of selling price determined by considering multiple factors including, internal costs, gross margin and historical pricing practices. after allocating the overall consideration from such sale to each deliverable using a best estimate of the selling price, (i) revenue from the sale of envoy devices is recognized upon shipment, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met and (ii) revenue from the web-based monitoring service is recognized ratably over the estimated economic life of the related envoy devices of 10 years.
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. we determine cost on a first-in first-out basis. certain factors could affect the realizable value of its inventory, including customer demand and market conditions. management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis and writes down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand, anticipated sales price, effect of new product introductions, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors. inventory write-downs are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and their estimated net realizable market value. in 2014 and 2013, write-downs of inventories were insignificant. in 2012, we recorded write-downs of inventories of $0.8 million.
business combinations we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. we use judgment to estimate the fair value of contingent consideration (a component of the purchase consideration), identify all the tangible and intangible assets acquired, estimate the fair value of these assets, estimate the useful life of the assets, and assess the appropriate method for recognizing depreciation or amortization expense over the asset's useful life. we believe that the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions impact the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our consolidated balance sheets, the future amount of amortization and depreciation expense that will be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations, and the amount of goodwill which will be subject to impairment testing performed in subsequent periods. critical estimates in valuing contingent consideration include but are not limited to probabilities applied to multiple payout scenarios and a risk-adjusted discount rate. critical estimates in valuing intangible assets (i.e. customer relationships) include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and customer attrition rates. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.

warranty obligations microinverters sold through december 31, 2013
our warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units that fail during the product's warranty term (15 years for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years for third and fourth generation microinverters). on a quarterly basis, we employ a consistent, systematic and rational methodology to assess the adequacy of its warranty liability. this assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each generation of product, based on historical results, trends and the most current data available as of the filing date. the key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. the key estimates used by us to estimate its warranty liability are: (1) the number of units expected to fail over time (i.e. failure rate); (2) the number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time (i.e. claim rate); and (3) the per unit cost of replacement units, including outbound shipping and limited labor costs, expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time (i.e. replacement cost).
estimated failure rates-our quality and reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of microinverter. to establish initial failure rate estimates for each generation of microinverter, our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mtbf (mean time between failure) estimates for individual components contained in its microinverters, third party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our microinverters are installed, and rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the microinverter in a short period of time. as units are deployed into operating environments, we continue to monitor product performance via our enlighten monitoring platform. it typically takes three to nine months between the date of sale and date of end-user installation. consequently, our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three to nine months. when a microinverter fails and is returned, we performs diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanism(s) causing the failure. we then use the results of this analysis (combined with the actual, cumulative performance data collected on those units prior to failure via enlighten) to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanism(s) will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base.
estimated claim rates-warranty claim rate estimates are based upon assumptions with respect to expected customer behavior over the warranty period. as the vast majority of our microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications, we believe that warranty claim rates will be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file claims than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters.
estimated replacement costs-three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost: (1) the estimated cost of replacement microinverters; (2) the estimated cost to ship replacement microinverters to end users; and (3) the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement services for the end user. because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective microinverters over long periods of time (either 15 or 25 years, depending on the generation of product purchased), the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost. estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable, market-based shipping costs paid by us to third party freight carriers. we have a separate program that allows third-party installers to claim fixed-dollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed microinverter units for a limited time from the date of original installation. included in our estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixed-dollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third party installers over the limited offering period.
if actual failure rates, claim rates, or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods, changes to these estimates would be required, resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations. such increases or decreases could be material.
fair value option for microinverters sold since january 1, 2014
our warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since january 1, 2014 provide us the right, but not the requirement, to assign our warranty obligations to a third-party. under accounting standards codification ("asc") 825-financial instruments, ("fair value option"), an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes the eligible item. we made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with microinverters sold since january 1, 2014 at fair value. this election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years.
39
we estimate the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to january 1, 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result. the expected present value technique, an income approach, converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount. in addition to the key estimates of failure rates, claim rates and replacement costs, we used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on our credit-adjusted risk-free rate. see note 8, ("fair value measurements") to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2014-09 (topic 606), revenue from contracts with customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap. the updated standard's core principle is that revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the standard generally requires an entity to identify performance obligations in its contracts, estimate the amount of variable consideration to be received in the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation, and recognize revenue as obligations are satisfied. in addition, the updated standard requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. asu 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2016. early adoption is not permitted. accordingly, the asu will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2017. we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
no other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective in 2014 had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

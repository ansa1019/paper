item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. the discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are based upon our current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to inaccurate assumptions and known or unknown risks and uncertainties, including those identified in uncertainty of forward-looking statements and information below and in item 1a. risk factors.
introduction we are a leading provider of specialty contracting services, offering infrastructure solutions primarily to the electric power and oil and gas industries in the united states, canada and australia and select other international markets. the services we provide include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of infrastructure within each of the industries we serve, such as electric power transmission and distribution networks, substation facilities, renewable energy facilities, pipeline transmission and distribution systems and facilities, and infrastructure services for the offshore and inland water energy markets. we also own fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure in select markets and license the right to use these point-to-point fiber optic telecommunications facilities to customers.
we report our results under three reportable segments: (1) electric power infrastructure services, (2) oil and gas infrastructure services and (3) fiber optic licensing and other. this structure is generally focused on broad end-user markets for our services. our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014 were approximately $7.85 billion, of which 67% was attributable to the electric power infrastructure services segment, 31% to the oil and gas infrastructure services segment and 2% to the fiber optic licensing and other segment.
our customers include many of the leading companies in the industries we serve. we have developed strong strategic alliances with numerous customers and strive to develop and maintain our status as a preferred vendor to our customers. we enter into various types of contracts, including competitive unit price, hourly rate, cost-plus (or time and materials basis), and fixed price (or lump sum basis), the final terms and prices of which are frequently negotiated with the customer. although the terms of our contracts vary considerably, most are made on either a unit price or fixed price basis in which we agree to do the work for a price per unit of work performed (unit price) or for a fixed amount for the entire project (fixed price). we complete a substantial majority of our fixed price projects, other than certain large transmission projects, within one year, while we frequently provide maintenance and repair work under open-ended unit price or cost-plus master service agreements that are renewable periodically.
we recognize revenue on our unit price and cost-plus contracts as units are completed or services are performed. for our fixed price contracts, we record revenues as work on the contract progresses on a percentage-of-completion basis. under this method, revenue is recognized based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract. fixed price contracts generally include retainage provisions under which a percentage of the contract price is withheld until the project is complete and has been accepted by our customer.
for internal management purposes, we are organized into three internal divisions, namely, the electric power division, the oil and gas infrastructure division and the fiber optic licensing division. these internal divisions are closely aligned with the reportable segments described above based on the predominant type of work provided by the operating units within each division.
reportable segment information, including revenues and operating income by type of work, is gathered from each operating unit for the purpose of evaluating segment performance in support of our market strategies. these classifications of our operating unit revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes can at times
40
require judgment on the part of management. our operating units may perform joint infrastructure service projects for customers in multiple industries, deliver multiple types of infrastructure services under a single customer contract or provide services across industries  for example, joint trenching projects to install distribution lines for electric power and natural gas customers. our integrated operations and common administrative support at each of our operating units requires that certain allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, indirect operating expenses including depreciation, and general and administrative costs, be made to determine operating segment profitability. corporate costs, such as payroll and benefits, employee travel expenses, facility costs, professional fees, acquisition costs and amortization related to certain intangible assets are not allocated.
the electric power infrastructure services segment provides comprehensive network solutions to customers in the electric power industry. services performed by the electric power infrastructure services segment generally include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power transmission and distribution infrastructure and substation facilities along with other engineering and technical services. this segment also provides emergency restoration services, including the repair of infrastructure damaged by inclement weather, the energized installation, maintenance and upgrade of electric power infrastructure utilizing unique bare hand and hot stick methods and our proprietary robotic arm technologies, and the installation of smart grid technologies on electric power networks. in addition, this segment designs, installs and maintains renewable energy generation facilities, consisting of solar, wind and certain types of natural gas generation facilities, and related switchyards and transmission infrastructure. to a lesser extent, this segment provides services such as the construction of electric power generation facilities, the design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, installation of traffic networks and the installation of cable and control systems for light rail lines.
the oil and gas infrastructure services segment provides comprehensive network solutions to customers involved in the development and transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline products. services performed by the oil and gas infrastructure services segment generally include the design, installation, repair and maintenance of pipeline transmission and distribution systems, gathering systems, production systems and compressor and pump stations, as well as related trenching, directional boring and automatic welding services. in addition, this segments services include pipeline protection, integrity testing, rehabilitation and replacement, and fabrication of pipeline support systems and related structures and facilities. we also serve the offshore and inland water energy markets, primarily providing services to oil and gas exploration platforms, including mechanical installation (or hook-ups), electrical and instrumentation, pre-commissioning and commissioning, coatings, fabrication, pipeline construction, integrity services and marine asset repair. to a lesser extent, this segment designs, installs and maintains fueling systems as well as water and sewer infrastructure.
the fiber optic licensing and other segment designs, procures, constructs, maintains and owns fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure in select markets and licenses the right to use these point-to-point fiber optic telecommunications facilities to our customers pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with terms from five to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal options. under those agreements, customers are provided the right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic network, with the network owned and maintained by us. we are also expanding our service offerings to provide lit services, with quanta providing network management services to customers, as well as owning the electronic equipment necessary to make the fiber optic network operational. we believe market opportunities exist for lit services that will enable us to leverage capacities of our dark fiber networks, as well as providing other attractive growth opportunities. the fiber optic licensing and other segment provides services to communication carriers, as well as education, financial services, healthcare and other business enterprises with high bandwidth telecommunication needs. the telecommunication services provided through this segment are subject to regulation by the federal communications commission and certain state public utility commissions. the fiber optic licensing and other segment also provides various telecommunication infrastructure services on a limited and ancillary basis, primarily to our customers in the electric power industry.

recent investments, acquisitions and divestitures during 2014, we completed nine acquisitions, which enabled us to further enhance our electric power and oil and gas infrastructure service offerings in the united states and canada and expand our capabilities in australia to include electric power infrastructure service offerings. these acquisitions included four electric power infrastructure services companies located in canada; two oil and gas infrastructure services businesses located in canada; an electric power infrastructure services company located in australia; a u.s. based general engineering and construction company specializing in hydrant fueling, waterfront and utility construction for the u.s. department of defense that is generally included in our oil and gas infrastructure services segment; and a geotechnical and geological engineering services company based in the united states that is generally included in our electric power infrastructure services segment. the aggregate consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $284.3 million in cash, 686,382 shares of quanta common stock and 3,825,971 exchangeable shares of canadian subsidiaries of quanta that are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for quanta common stock. the exchangeable shares provide holders with rights equivalent to quanta common stockholders with respect to dividends and other economic rights. in addition, we issued one share of series g preferred stock associated with 899,858 of the exchangeable shares, which generally votes on the same matters as quanta common stock and is entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of such exchangeable shares outstanding at that time. exchangeable shares not associated with preferred stock do not have voting rights. the aggregate value of the securities issued related to 2014 acquisitions on the respective closing or settlement dates of the acquisitions, totaled approximately $134.5 million. as these transactions were effective during 2014, the results of each acquired company have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective dates of acquisition.
during 2013, we acquired six businesses, which included three electric power and three oil and gas infrastructure services companies. the electric power acquisitions expanded our geographic presence primarily in the northeastern, midwestern and western regions of the united states and in the central region of canada, while the oil and gas infrastructure services companies increased our capacity to provide mechanical installations for the offshore oil and gas industry and pipeline logistics services throughout the united states and expanded our geographic presence to include pipeline construction services in australia. the aggregate consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $341.1 million in cash and 3,547,482 shares of our common stock valued, as of the respective dates of issuance, at approximately $88.9 million. the results for each company have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective dates of acquisition.
on december 6, 2013, we sold all of our equity ownership interest in howard midstream energy partners, llc (hep) for proceeds of approximately $220.9 million in cash, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $112.7 million.
during 2012, we acquired four businesses, which included one electric power infrastructure services company based in canada, two electric power infrastructure services companies based in the united states and one oil and gas infrastructure services company based in the united states. these businesses have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. the aggregate consideration for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $57.5 million in cash, 1,927,113 shares of our common stock valued, as of the respective dates of acquisition, at approximately $37.3 million and the repayment of $11.0 million in debt. these acquisitions have enabled us to further expand our capabilities and scope of services internationally and in the united states. the financial results of these businesses are generally included in the corresponding segment.
on december 3, 2012, we sold substantially all of our domestic telecommunications infrastructure services operations and related subsidiaries.
seasonality; fluctuations of results; economic conditions our revenues and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. these variations are influenced by weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, project timing and schedules, and holidays.
42
typically, our revenues are lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or wet conditions can cause delays on projects. in addition, many of our customers develop their capital budgets for the coming year during the first quarter and do not begin infrastructure projects in a meaningful way until their capital budgets are finalized. second quarter revenues are typically higher than those in the first quarter, as some projects begin, but continued cold and wet weather can often impact second quarter productivity. third quarter revenues are typically the highest of the year, as a greater number of projects are underway, and weather is more accommodating. generally, revenues during the fourth quarter of the year are lower than the third quarter but higher than the second quarter. many projects are completed in the fourth quarter, and revenues are often impacted positively by customers seeking to spend their capital budgets before the end of the year; however, the holiday season and inclement weather can sometimes cause delays, reducing revenues and increasing costs. any quarter may be positively or negatively affected by atypical weather patterns in any of the areas we serve, such as severe weather, excessive rainfall or warmer winter weather, making it difficult to predict these variations and their effect on particular projects quarter to quarter. the timing of project awards and unanticipated changes in project schedules as a result of delays or accelerations can also create variations in the level of operating activity from quarter to quarter.
these seasonal impacts are typical for our u.s. operations, but as our foreign operations continue to grow, we may see a lessening of this pattern impacting our quarterly revenues. for example, revenues in canada are often higher in the first quarter as projects are accelerated so that work can be completed prior to the break up, or seasonal thaw, as productivity is adversely affected by wet ground conditions during the warmer spring and summer months. also, although revenues from australia and other international operations have not been significant relative to our overall revenues to date, their seasonal patterns may differ from those in north america and may impact our seasonality more in the future.
additionally, our industry can be highly cyclical. as a result, our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines or delays in new projects in various geographic regions, including the united states, canada and australia. project schedules, particularly in connection with larger, longer-term projects, can also create fluctuations in the services provided, which may adversely affect us in a given period. the financial condition of our customers and their access to capital, variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular period, regional, national and global economic and market conditions, timing of acquisitions, the timing and magnitude of acquisition and integration costs associated with acquisitions, dispositions, fluctuations in our equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates, impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets or investments and interest rate fluctuations are examples of items that may also materially affect quarterly results. accordingly, our operating results in any particular period may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period.
we and our customers continue to operate in an uncertain business environment, with heightened regulatory and environmental requirements, stringent permitting processes and only gradual recovery in the economy from recessionary levels. oil prices have declined significantly over the past several months. the recent decline in oil prices has created uncertainty with respect to the demand for our oil and gas infrastructure services in the near term, and it is also uncertain if, or for how long, oil prices will remain at lower levels. over time, we expect that, as the current oversupply of global oil corrects and global demand for oil increases, oil prices could recover from current levels. we believe that, at a minimum, medium and long term production of oil from north american unconventional shale formations and the canadian oil sands will continue, which will create demand for our infrastructure services over time.
we are closely monitoring our customers and the effect that changes in economic and market conditions have had or may have on them. certain of our customers have reduced or delayed spending in recent years, which we attribute primarily to regulatory and permitting hurdles and negative economic and market conditions, and we anticipate that these issues may continue to affect demand for some of our services in the near-term. as mentioned previously, there have been significant decreases in oil prices since mid-2014. if the development or discovery of natural gas and/or oil reserves slowed or stopped as a result of low natural gas or oil prices or
43
otherwise, customers may reduce capital spending on mainline pipe, gas gathering and compressor systems and other related infrastructure, resulting in less demand for our services. we believe that most of our customers, many of whom are regulated utilities, remain financially stable in general and will be able to continue with their business plans in the long-term. you should read outlook and understanding margins for additional discussion of trends and challenges that may affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
understanding margins our gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues, and our operating margin is operating income expressed as a percentage of revenues. cost of services, which is subtracted from revenues to obtain gross profit, consists primarily of salaries, wages and benefits to employees, depreciation, fuel and other equipment expenses, equipment rentals, subcontracted services, insurance, facilities expenses, materials and parts and supplies. selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets are then subtracted from gross profit to obtain operating income. various factors  some controllable, some not  can impact our margins on a quarterly or annual basis.
seasonal and geographical. as discussed previously, seasonal patterns can have a significant impact on margins. generally, business is slower in the winter months versus the warmer months of the year, resulting in lower productivity and consequently reducing our ability to cover fixed costs. this can be offset somewhat by increased demand for electrical service and repair work resulting from severe weather. additionally, project schedules, including when projects begin and when they are completed, may impact margins. the mix of business conducted in the areas we serve will also affect margins, as some of the areas we serve offer the opportunity for higher margins than others due to the geographic characteristics associated with the physical location where the work is being performed. such characteristics include whether the project is performed in an urban versus a rural setting or in a mountainous area or in open terrain. site conditions, including unforeseen underground conditions, can also impact margins.
weather. adverse or favorable weather conditions can impact gross margins in a given period. for example, snow or rainfall in the areas in which we operate may negatively impact our revenues and margins due to reduced productivity, as projects may be delayed or temporarily placed on hold until weather conditions improve. conversely, in periods when weather remains dry and temperatures are accommodating, more work can be done, sometimes with less cost, which would have a favorable impact on margins. in some cases, severe weather, such as hurricanes and ice storms, can provide us with higher margin emergency restoration service work, which generally has a positive impact on margins.
revenue mix. the mix of revenues derived from the industries we serve will impact margins, as certain industries provide higher margin opportunities. additionally, changes in our customers spending patterns in each of the industries we serve can cause an imbalance in supply and demand and, therefore, affect margins and mix of revenues by industry served.
service and maintenance versus installation. installation work is often performed on a fixed price basis, while maintenance work is often performed under pre-established or negotiated prices or cost-plus pricing arrangements. margins for installation work may vary from project to project, and may be higher than maintenance work, as work obtained on a fixed price basis has higher risk than other types of pricing arrangements. we typically derive approximately 30% of our annual revenues from maintenance work, but a higher portion of installation work in any given period may affect our gross margins for that period.
subcontract work. work that is subcontracted to other service providers generally yields lower margins. an increase in subcontract work in a given period may contribute to a decrease in margins. we typically subcontract approximately 20% to 25% of our work to other service providers.
materials versus labor. typically, our customers are responsible for supplying their own materials on projects; however, for some of our contracts, we may agree to procure all or part of the required materials.
44
margins may be lower on projects where we furnish a significant amount of materials, as our mark-up on materials is generally lower than on our labor costs. in a given period, an increase in the percentage of work with higher materials procurement requirements may decrease our overall margins.
depreciation. we include depreciation in cost of services. this is common practice in our industry, but it can make comparability of our margins to those of other companies difficult. this must be taken into consideration when comparing us to other companies.
insurance. as discussed in liquidity and capital resources  self-insurance, we are insured for employers liability, general liability, auto liability and workers compensation claims. we also have employee health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements. margins could be impacted by fluctuations in insurance accruals as additional claims arise and as circumstances and conditions of existing claims change.
performance risk. margins may fluctuate because of the volume of work and the impacts of pricing and job productivity, which can be affected both favorably and negatively by weather, geography, customer decisions and crew productivity. for example, when comparing a service contract between a current quarter and the comparable prior years quarter, factors affecting the gross margins associated with the revenues generated by the contract may include pricing under the contract, the volume of work performed under the contract, the mix of the type of work specifically being performed and the productivity of the crews performing the work. productivity can be influenced by many factors, including where the work is performed (e.g., rural versus urban area or mountainous or rocky area versus open terrain), whether the work is on an open or encumbered right of way, the impacts of inclement weather or the effects of environmental restrictions or regulatory delays. these types of factors are not practicable to quantify through accounting data, but each of these items may individually or in the aggregate have a direct impact on the gross margin of a specific project.
foreign currency risk. our financial performance on a u.s. dollar-denominated basis is subject to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. fluctuations in exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar, primarily the canadian and australian dollars, could cause material fluctuations in comparisons of our results of operations between periods.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to management, administrative salaries and benefits, marketing, office rent and utilities, communications, professional fees, bad debt expense, acquisition costs, gains and losses on the sale of property and equipment, letter of credit fees and maintenance, training and conversion costs related to the implementation of an information technology solution.
results of operations as previously discussed, we have acquired certain businesses, the results of which have been included in the following results of operations beginning on their respective acquisition dates. additionally, the results of operations of the telecommunications subsidiaries disposed of on december 3, 2012 have been reclassified from continuing operations to income from discontinued operations. the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of revenues for the years indicated (dollars in thousands).

2014 compared to 2013
revenues. revenues increased $1.33 billion, or 20.4%, to $7.85 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was due in part to higher electric power infrastructure services revenues, which increased $758.0 million, or 16.9%, to $5.24 billion as a result of increased activity from electric power transmission, distribution and power generation projects in connection with of increased capital spending by our customers and approximately $225 million in revenues generated by acquired companies. also contributing to the increase were additional revenues from oil and gas infrastructure services, which increased $574.9 million, or 30.8%, to $2.44 billion, primarily due to approximately $500 million in revenues generated by acquired companies and increased capital spending by our customers. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues from fiber optic licensing and other, which decreased $4.5 million, or 2.6%, to $168.1 million.
gross profit. gross profit increased $178.1 million, or 16.9%, to $1.23 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily due to higher overall revenues earned during the current period. gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 15.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 16.2% for the year ended december 31, 2013. this decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the negative impact of wet weather conditions, primarily in canada and northern regions of the united states, as these areas experienced a late thaw from the winter season, as well as lower margins recognized on certain power generation projects
46
ongoing during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to similar projects completed during the year ended december 31, 2013 and less favorable foreign currency exchange rates. these lower margins were partially offset by the contribution of mainline pipe revenues, which typically offer higher margin opportunities.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $221.0 million, or 44.1%, to $722.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily attributable to an aggregate $102.5 million charge to provision for long-term contract receivable associated with an electric power infrastructure services project completed in 2012, which was the subject of a recently settled arbitration proceeding, and an aggregate $38.8 million expense associated with an adverse arbitration decision regarding a contract dispute with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago (ngc) on a 2010 directional drilling project, as well as $68.2 million in incremental general and administrative costs associated with acquired companies, $11.6 million in higher professional fees and $7.6 million in higher ancillary administration costs. these increases were partially offset by $13.4 million in lower compensation and incentive costs associated with current levels of profitability. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 9.2% for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 7.7% for the year ended december 31, 2013, due primarily to the impact of the provision for long-term contract receivable and the expense associated with the ngc arbitration decision discussed above. the impact of these items was partially offset by better absorption of general and administrative expenses due to the higher revenues described above.
amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets increased $8.4 million to $35.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily due to increased amortization of intangibles associated with companies acquired since the fourth quarter of 2013, partially offset by reduced amortization expense from previously acquired intangible assets as certain of these assets became fully amortized.
interest expense. interest expense increased $2.1 million to $4.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 due to increased borrowing activity, fees associated with the increase in unused capacity of our expanded credit facility and higher amortization of deferred financing costs following the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement on october 30, 2013.
interest income. interest income was $3.7 million and $3.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. the increase was primarily due to a higher volume of cash in foreign banks during the year ended december 31, 2014, which generally had a higher rate of return than balances in domestic banks, partially offset by lower foreign currency exchange rates in the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013.
equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates. equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates was a loss of $0.3 million and income of $112.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013. during the fourth quarter of 2013, we sold all of our equity ownership interest in hep for proceeds of approximately $220.9 million in cash which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $112.7 million.
provision for income taxes. the provision for income taxes was $157.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, with an effective tax rate of 33.3%. the provision for income taxes was $217.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, with an effective tax rate of 34.1%. the effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 were impacted by the recording of net tax benefits in the amounts of $8.2 million in 2014 and $10.0 million in 2013 associated with decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of various federal and state statute of limitations periods. excluding the tax benefits from decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions, the effective tax rates would have been 35.0% and 35.7% for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. the lower effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily due to a higher proportion of income before taxes earned from international jurisdictions, which are generally taxed at lower statutory rates.
other comprehensive income (loss). other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes was a loss of $86.1 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to a loss of $51.7 million in the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments related to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the canadian and australian dollars throughout 2014 and 2013.
47
2013 compared to 2012
revenues. revenues increased $602.6 million, or 10.2%, to $6.52 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily due to higher revenues from the oil and gas infrastructure services segment, which increased $334.9 million, or 21.8%, to $1.87 billion, primarily due to increased revenues from pipeline projects related to unconventional shale formations in certain regions of north america and $167.7 million in revenues generated from companies acquired in 2013. additionally, revenues from electric power infrastructure services projects increased $274.1 million, or 6.5%, to $4.48 billion primarily as a result of increases in capital spending by our customers and $83.6 million in revenues generated from companies acquired in 2013. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of $139.7 million in electric power revenues from emergency restoration services during 2013 as compared to 2012. emergency restoration services revenues were higher in 2012 primarily as a result of hurricane sandy, which impacted the northeastern united states in the fourth quarter of 2012.
gross profit. gross profit increased $117.7 million, or 12.6%, to $1.06 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013. gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 16.2% for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to 15.8% for the year ended december 31, 2012. these increases were primarily due to the impact of higher revenues and a result of overall performance improvements in the oil and gas infrastructure services segment during the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2012, which was negatively impacted by increased project costs as a result of performance issues caused by adverse weather conditions on certain projects that did not recur to the same extent during 2013. these increases were partially offset by the decreased contribution of emergency restoration services revenues, which typically yield higher margins.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $66.1 million, or 15.2%, to $501.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to approximately $42.7 million in higher salary and incentive compensation costs associated with increased levels of operating activity and profitability. included in this increase in compensation costs was approximately $4.3 million of expense related to the accelerated vesting of equity-based awards associated with the retirement of the former executive chairman of our board of directors in the second quarter of 2013. also contributing to the overall increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was approximately $21.3 million in incremental administrative expenses related to companies acquired in 2013 and $5.1 million in higher costs associated with our ongoing technology and business development initiatives. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from 7.3% for the year ended december 31, 2012 to 7.7% for the year ended december 31, 2013 due to the impact of higher salary and incentive compensation costs previously discussed coupled with the impact from lower levels of emergency restoration services revenues in 2013 as compared to 2012.
amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets decreased $10.2 million to $27.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this decrease was primarily due to reduced amortization expense from previously acquired intangible assets as certain of these assets became fully amortized, partially offset by increased amortization of intangibles associated with businesses acquired during 2013.
interest expense. interest expense decreased $1.1 million to $2.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2012 due to lower levels of borrowings under our credit facility during the year ended december 31, 2013.
interest income. interest income was $3.4 million and $1.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012. the increase was primarily due to higher average cash balances and interest rates during the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2012.
equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates. equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates was income of $112.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to income of $2.1
48
million for the year ended december 31, 2012. during the fourth quarter of 2013, we sold all of our equity ownership interest in hep for proceeds of approximately $220.9 million in cash which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $112.7 million.
provision for income taxes. the provision for income taxes was $217.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, with an effective tax rate of 34.1%. the provision for income taxes was $158.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, with an effective tax rate of 34.2%. the effective tax rates for 2013 and 2012 were primarily impacted by the recording of net tax benefits in the amount of $10.0 million in 2013 and $7.9 million in 2012 associated with decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of various federal and state statute of limitation periods and settlement of certain tax audits. excluding the tax benefits from decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions, the effective tax rates would have been 35.7% and 35.9% for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012.
other comprehensive income (loss). other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes was a loss of $51.7 million in the year ended december 31, 2013, compared to income of $13.7 million in the year ended december 31, 2012. the other comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2013 was primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the canadian and australian dollars. the other comprehensive income for the year ended december 31, 2012 was primarily due to the weakening of the u.s. dollar against the canadian dollar.

2014 compared to 2013
electric power infrastructure services segment results revenues for this segment increased $758.0 million, or 16.9%, to $5.24 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014. revenues were positively impacted by increased activity from electric power transmission, distribution and power generation projects primarily as a result of increased capital spending by our customers and approximately $225 million in revenues generated by acquired companies. partially offsetting these increases was a negative impact on reported revenues from our international operations as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily attributable to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the canadian dollar.
49
operating income decreased $63.5 million, or 12.2%, to $458.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. operating income as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 8.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 11.6% for the year ended december 31, 2013. these decreases were primarily due to the impact of the $102.5 million provision for long-term contract receivable as well as the negative production impact of wet weather conditions, primarily in canada and northern regions of the united states, as these areas experienced a late thaw from the winter season. additionally, lower margins were recognized on certain power generation projects ongoing during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to projects completed during the year ended december 31, 2013. these decreases were partially offset by contributions from the overall impact of segment revenues described above, which improved this segments ability to cover fixed and overhead costs.
oil and gas infrastructure services segment results revenues for this segment increased $574.9 million, or 30.8%, to $2.44 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014. revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014 were favorably impacted by approximately $500 million in revenues generated by acquired companies in the united states, canada and australia, the majority of which was transmission related, and increased capital spending by our customers, primarily related to distribution. partially offsetting these increases was a negative impact on reported revenues from our international operations as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily attributable to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the canadian dollar and australian dollar.
operating income increased $24.3 million, or 17.5%, to $162.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily due to the increase in segment revenues described above, including contributions from mainline pipe projects in the united states and australia, which typically offer higher margin opportunities, and the favorable settlement of certain contract change orders during the period. operating income as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 6.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 7.4% for the year ended december 31, 2013. this decrease was primarily due to an aggregate $38.8 million expense recorded in 2014 associated with an adverse arbitration decision regarding a contract dispute with ngc on a 2010 directional drilling project, as well as to the impact of an increase in the estimated withdrawal liability associated with the central states, southeast and southwest areas pension plan (the central states plan) based on certain withdrawal scenarios that increased the estimated range of possible liability.
fiber optic licensing and other segment results revenues for this segment decreased $4.5 million, or 2.6%, to $168.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this decrease in revenues was due to lower levels of ancillary telecommunication services revenues during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 as certain larger projects completed in the year ended december 31, 2013 did not recur to the same extent in the year ended december 31, 2014.
operating income decreased $1.0 million, or 1.9%, to $54.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the decrease in segment revenues described above. operating income as a percentage of segment revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased to 32.4% as compared to 32.1% for the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to a $3.2 million charge recorded during 2013 associated with a revised assessment of state gross receipts tax requirements on fiber optic licensing revenues as a result of an industry related legal proceeding, partially offset by higher network maintenance costs during 2014.
50
corporate and non-allocated costs certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets are not allocated to segments. corporate and non-allocated costs for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased $11.1 million to $199.9 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was partially due to $8.4 million in higher amortization expense primarily due to the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets from 2014 and 2013 acquisitions, $8.0 million in higher consulting and other professional fees, $6.4 million in higher acquisition and integration costs and $2.1 million in higher ongoing technology and business development initiatives. these increases were partially offset by $15.6 million in lower compensation and incentive costs associated with current levels of profitability and due to the impact of approximately $4.3 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense in the second quarter of 2013 related to the retirement of the former executive chairman of our board of directors.
2013 compared to 2012
electric power infrastructure services segment results revenues for this segment increased $274.1 million, or 6.5%, to $4.48 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013. revenues were positively impacted by increased activity in electric power transmission and distribution projects, which resulted primarily from increased capital spending by our customers. revenues in 2013 were also favorably impacted by the additional contribution of approximately $83.6 million in revenues from companies acquired in 2013. partially offsetting these increases was a decline in revenues from emergency restoration services, which decreased approximately $139.7 million to approximately $110.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2012. emergency restoration services revenues were higher in 2012 primarily as a result of hurricane sandy, which impacted the northeastern united states in the fourth quarter of 2012. revenues for the year ended december 31, 2013 were also negatively impacted by lower revenues related to renewable energy projects due to decreased capital spending by our customers primarily as a result of a change in the tax incentives associated with these types of projects.
operating income increased $1.0 million, or 0.2%, to $521.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, while operating income as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 11.6% for the year ended december 31, 2013 from 12.4% for the year ended december 31, 2012. operating income was positively impacted in 2013 by higher overall levels of infrastructure service revenues. however, these increases were substantially offset by lower levels of operating income contributed from emergency restoration services revenues in 2013 as compared to 2012, which typically yield higher margins.
oil and gas infrastructure services segment results revenues for this segment increased $334.9 million, or 21.8%, to $1.87 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2012 primarily due to an increase in revenues from pipeline projects related to unconventional shale formations in certain regions of north america. revenues for the year ended december 31, 2013 were also favorably impacted by approximately $167.7 million in revenues from companies acquired in 2013.
operating income increased $83.1 million to $138.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $55.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. operating income as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 7.4% for the year ended december 31, 2013 from 3.6% for the year ended december 31, 2012. these increases were primarily due to continued performance improvements in project execution and the overall increase in segment revenues described above, which improved this segments ability to cover fixed and overhead costs. operating margins for the year ended december 31, 2012 were negatively impacted by increased project costs as a result of performance issues caused by adverse weather conditions on certain projects which did not recur to the same extent during 2013.

fiber optic licensing and other segment results revenues for this segment decreased $6.5 million, or 3.6%, to $172.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in revenues related to ancillary telecommunications and wireless infrastructure projects, partially offset by increased revenues from the installation of a statewide fiber optic network in pennsylvania and from increased licensing of point-to-point fiber optic telecommunications facilities as a result of our continued network expansion activities.
operating income decreased $5.9 million, or 9.6%, to $55.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. operating income as a percentage of segment revenues for the year ended december 31, 2013 decreased to 32.1% compared to 34.2% for the year ended december 31, 2012. these decreases were primarily due to a $3.2 million charge associated with a revised assessment of state gross receipts tax requirements on fiber optic licensing revenues as a result of a recent industry related legal proceeding, as well as higher network maintenance costs during 2013, startup costs for new lit service offerings, and the decrease in segment revenues described above.
corporate and non-allocated costs certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets are not allocated to segments. corporate and non-allocated costs for the year ended december 31, 2013 increased $16.5 million to $188.9 million. contributing to this increase was approximately $24.8 million in higher salary and incentive compensation costs associated with increased levels of operating activity and profitability. included in this increase in compensation costs was approximately $4.3 million of expense related to the accelerated vesting of equity-based awards associated with the retirement of the former executive chairman of our board of directors in the second quarter of 2013. also contributing to the increase was approximately $4.6 million in higher acquisition and integration costs and $2.7 million in costs associated with our ongoing technology and business development initiatives. partially offsetting these increases was a $10.2 million decrease in amortization expense as previously acquired intangible assets became fully amortized, partially offset by amortization expense related to 2013 acquisitions.
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements our cash and cash equivalents totaled $190.5 million and $488.8 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, cash and cash equivalents held in domestic bank accounts were approximately $127.2 million and $236.7 million, and cash and cash equivalents held in foreign bank accounts were approximately $63.3 million and $252.1 million, held primarily in canada and australia. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, cash and cash equivalents held by our investments in joint ventures, which are either consolidated or proportionately consolidated, were approximately $19.1 million and $18.9 million. we have no rights with respect to the joint ventures cash except as permitted pursuant to their respective partnership agreements.
we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement at december 31, 2014. we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, existing borrowing capacity under our credit facility, and our future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient funds to enable us to meet our future operating needs and our planned capital expenditures, as well as facilitate our ability to grow in the foreseeable future.
our industry is capital intensive, and we expect the need for substantial capital expenditures to continue into the foreseeable future to meet the anticipated demand for our services. capital expenditures are expected to total $275 million to $300 million for 2015. approximately $50 million to $60 million of the expected 2015 capital expenditures are targeted for the expansion of our fiber optic networks.
we also evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions from time to time that may require cash, as well as opportunities to make investments in customer-sponsored projects where we anticipate performing services such
52
as project management, engineering, procurement or construction services. these investment opportunities exist in the markets and industries we serve and may require the use of cash in the form of debt or equity investments.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to purchase, from time to time through december 31, 2016, up to $500.0 million of our outstanding common stock. these repurchases can be made in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions, including block purchases or otherwise, at managements discretion, and this program does not obligate us to acquire any specific amount of common stock. as of december 31, 2014, we had repurchased $93.5 million of our common stock under this program. during the first quarter of 2015, we repurchased an additional $182.0 million of our common stock under this program.
management continues to monitor the financial markets and general national and global economic conditions for factors that may affect our liquidity an capital resources. we consider our cash investment policies to be conservative in that we maintain a diverse portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality cash investments with short-term maturities. accordingly, we do not anticipate that any weakness in the capital markets will have a material impact on the principal amounts of our cash investments or our ability to rely upon our credit facility for funds. to date, we have experienced no loss of or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents or funds under our credit facility; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents or availability under our credit facility will not be impacted in the future by adverse conditions in the financial markets.
through december 31, 2014, we have not provided u.s. income taxes on approximately $344.5 million of unremitted foreign earnings. if we were to repatriate cash that is indefinitely reinvested outside the united states, we could be subject to additional u.s. income and foreign withholding taxes. because of the number and variability of assumptions required, it is not practicable to determine the amount of any additional u.s. tax liability that may result if we decide to no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings outside the united states. if our intentions or u.s. tax laws change in the future, there may be a significant negative impact on the provision for income taxes and cash flows as a result of recording an incremental tax liability in the period such change occurs.
sources and uses of cash as of december 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $190.5 million and working capital of $1.42 billion. we also had $336.7 million of outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, $225.1 million of which was denominated in u.s. dollars and $111.6 million of which was denominated in australian or canadian dollars, and $68.8 million of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility, all of which was denominated in canadian dollars. as of december 31, 2014, our $1.325 billion senior secured revolving credit facility, which matures on october 30, 2018, had $919.5 million available for borrowings or issuing new letters of credit or bank guarantees.
operating activities cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our services and operating margins but can also be influenced by working capital needs associated with the various types of services that we provide. in particular, working capital needs may increase when we commence large volumes of work under circumstances where project costs, primarily associated with labor, equipment and subcontractors, are required to be paid before the receivables resulting from the work performed are billed and collected. accordingly, changes within working capital in accounts receivable, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts, and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are normally related and are typically affected on a collective basis by changes in revenue due to both changes in timing and volume of work performed and variability in the timing of customer billings and payments. additionally, working capital needs are generally higher during the summer and fall months due to increased demand for our services when favorable weather conditions exist in many of the regions in which we operate. conversely, working capital assets are typically converted to cash during the winter months. these seasonal trends can be offset by changes in the timing of projects which can be impacted by project delays or accelerations and other economic factors that may affect customer spending.
53
operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of $310.8 million during 2014 as compared to $446.6 million during 2013 and $166.8 million during 2012. the decrease in cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 was partially a result of the cash outflows associated with the $28.3 million arbitration payment described in legal proceedings  national gas company of trinidad and tobago arbitration in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. operating cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 was also impacted by increased working capital requirements associated with the ramp up of certain electric power transmission projects, as well as weather related delays in part of north america and the timing of project close-outs that affected the achievement of certain billing milestones. in comparison, the cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations during the year ended december 31, 2013 was positively impacted by the collection of receivables during the first quarter of 2013 attributable to significantly higher levels of emergency restoration services provided in the fourth quarter of 2012 which did not recur in the fourth quarter of 2013. the higher working capital requirements in 2012 were primarily due to the ramp up of multiple large electric transmission projects as well as higher levels of emergency restoration services projects, primarily as a result of hurricane sandy, which impacted the northeastern united states in the fourth quarter of 2012. also contributing to the increase in cash from operating activities from continuing operations were overall increased operating activity in 2014 and 2013 as compared to 2012.
days sales outstanding (dso) as of december 31, 2014 was 83 days, as compared to 72 days at december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily due to an additional seven days attributable to reclassification of the remaining $65 million receivable for the sunrise powerlink project as well as certain other retainage amounts from long-term to current assets as of december 31, 2014 and the impact of an acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2014. these items negatively affected the december 31, 2014 calculation of dso as there were no material fourth quarter revenues associated with these asset balances. dso is calculated by using the sum of current accounts receivable, net of allowance (which include retainage and unbilled balances), plus costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts less billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts, divided by average revenues per day during the quarter.
investing activities during 2014, we used net cash in investing activities from continuing operations of $542.9 million as compared to $320.0 million and $321.1 million used in investing activities in 2013 and 2012. investing activities from continuing operations in 2014 included $301.5 million used for capital expenditures and $262.2 million used in connection with business acquisitions, partially offset by $14.4 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. investing activities from continuing operations in 2013 included $263.6 million used for capital expenditures, $283.8 million used in connection with acquisitions and $10.0 million used for other investments (primarily comprised of the capital lease of an internally constructed electric power transmission asset). these amounts were partially offset by investments in and return on equity from unconsolidated affiliates of $186.2 million, which includes gross proceeds from the sale of all of our equity ownership in hep of approximately $220.9 million, the release of $36.5 million of restricted cash balances associated with a newly acquired company, and $14.8 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. investing activities from continuing operations in 2012 included $209.4 million used for capital expenditures, partially offset by $12.4 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. additionally, investing activities from continuing operations in 2012 included $68.7 million used in connection with business acquisitions and $53.8 million used in equity investment contributions, primarily to hep.
our industry is capital intensive, and we expect the need for substantial capital expenditures to continue into the foreseeable future to meet the anticipated demand for our services. in addition, we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments, although we cannot predict the timing or magnitude of the potential cash outlays for these initiatives.
54
financing activities during 2014, net cash used by financing activities from continuing operations was $58.3 million as compared to cash used by financing activities from continuing operations of $16.7 million and $15.3 million in 2013 and 2012. financing activities from continuing operations during 2014 included $93.5 million of common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program, $30.4 million of debt repayments primarily related to debt of acquired companies that was repaid shortly after their respective acquisition dates and $14.4 million of cash payments to non-controlling interests as distributions of joint venture profits, partially offset by $71.8 million of net proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility. financing activities from continuing operations in 2013 included $17.6 million of cash payments to non-controlling interests as distributions of joint venture profits, $3.2 million of loan costs related to the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement on october 30, 2013 and the positive impact of $3.7 million related to the tax impact of stock-based awards. financing activities from continuing operations in 2012 included $18.0 million of cash payments to non-controlling interests as distributions of joint venture profits.
debt instruments credit facility on october 30, 2013, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with various lenders that provides for a $1.325 billion senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on october 30, 2018. the entire amount available may be used for revolving loans and letters of credit in u.s. dollars. up to $400.0 million may be used for revolving loans and letters of credit in certain currencies other than u.s. dollars. swing line loans are limited to $50.0 million in u.s. dollars, $30.0 million in canadian dollars and $20.0 million in australian dollars. in addition, subject to the conditions specified in the credit agreement, we have the option to increase the revolving commitments by up to $300.0 million from time to time upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. borrowings under the credit agreement are to be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.
as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately $336.7 million of outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, $225.1 million of which was denominated in u.s. dollars and $111.6 million of which was denominated in australian and canadian dollars, and $68.8 million of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, all of which was denominated in canadian dollars. the remaining $919.5 million was available for borrowings or issuing new letters of credit or bank guarantees.
effective april 1, 2014, amounts borrowed under the credit agreement in u.s. dollars bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (i) the eurocurrency rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 1.125% to 2.125%, as determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio (as described below), or (ii) the base rate (as described below) plus 0.125% to 1.125%, as determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio. amounts borrowed as revolving loans under the credit agreement in any currency other than u.s. dollars bear interest at a rate equal to the eurocurrency rate plus 1.125% to 2.125%, as determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio. standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement are subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.125% to 2.125%, based on our consolidated leverage ratio, and performance letters of credit (as defined in the credit agreement) issued under the credit agreement in support of certain contractual obligations are subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.675% to 1.275%, based on our consolidated leverage ratio. we are also subject to a commitment fee of 0.20% to 0.40%, based on our consolidated leverage ratio, on any unused availability under the credit agreement.
prior to april 1, 2014, amounts borrowed under the credit agreement in u.s. dollars bore interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (i) the eurocurrency rate plus 1.25%, or (ii) the base rate plus 0.25%. amounts borrowed as revolving loans under the credit agreement in any currency other than u.s. dollars bore interest at a rate equal to the eurocurrency rate plus 1.25%. standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement were subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.25%, and performance letters of credit issued under the credit agreement in
55
support of certain contractual obligations were subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.75%. we were also subject to a commitment fee of 0.20% on any unused availability under the credit agreement.
the consolidated leverage ratio is the ratio of our consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda (as those terms are defined in the credit agreement). for purposes of calculating our consolidated leverage ratio, consolidated funded indebtedness is reduced by available cash and cash equivalents (as defined in the credit agreement) in excess of $25.0 million. the base rate equals the highest of (i) the federal funds rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 0.5%, (ii) the prime rate publicly announced by bank of america, n.a. and (iii) the eurocurrency rate plus 1.00%.
subject to certain exceptions, the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our wholly owned u.s. subsidiaries and by a pledge of all of the capital stock of our wholly owned u.s. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct foreign subsidiaries of our wholly owned u.s. subsidiaries. our wholly owned u.s. subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the credit agreement. subject to certain conditions, all collateral will automatically be released from the liens at any time we maintain an investment grade rating (defined in the credit agreement as two of the following three conditions being met: (i) a corporate credit rating that is bbb- or higher by standard & poors rating services, (ii) a corporate family rating that is baa3 or higher by moodys investors services, inc. or (iii) a corporate credit rating that is bbb- or higher by fitch ratings, inc.).
the credit agreement contains certain covenants, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (as such terms are defined in the credit agreement). the credit agreement also limits certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, indebtedness, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on our assets. the credit agreement allows cash payments for dividends and stock repurchases subject to compliance with the following requirements (after giving effect to the dividend or stock repurchase): (i) no default or event of default under the credit agreement; (ii) continued compliance with the financial covenants in the credit agreement; and (iii) at least $100 million of availability under the credit agreement and/or cash and cash equivalents on hand. as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all of the covenants in the credit agreement.
the credit agreement provides for customary events of default and contains cross-default provisions with our underwriting, continuing indemnity and security agreement with our sureties and all other debt instruments exceeding $75.0 million in borrowings or availability. if an event of default (as defined in the credit agreement) occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the credit agreement, the lenders may declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest immediately due and payable, require that we provide cash collateral for all outstanding letter of credit obligations, terminate the commitments under the credit agreement, and foreclose on the collateral.
off-balance sheet transactions as is common in our industry, we have entered into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets. our significant off-balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with non-cancelable operating leases, letter of credit obligations, commitments to expand our fiber optic networks, commitments to purchase equipment, surety guarantees, certain multi-employer pension plan liabilities and obligations relating to our investments and joint venture arrangements. certain joint venture structures involve risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets. for certain joint ventures, we have guaranteed all of the obligations of the joint venture under a contract with the customer. additionally, other joint venture arrangements qualify as a general partnership, for which we are jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of the joint venture. in our joint venture arrangements, typically each joint venturer indemnifies the other party for any liabilities incurred in excess of the liabilities such other party is obligated to bear under the respective joint venture agreement. other than as discussed in this report, we have not engaged in any material off-balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities, and we have no material guarantees of the work or obligations of third parties.
56
leases we enter into non-cancelable operating leases for many of our facility, vehicle and equipment needs. these leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them. we may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term, in which case we are typically liable to the lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease.
we have guaranteed the residual value of the underlying assets under certain of our equipment operating leases at the date of termination of such leases. we have agreed to pay any difference between this residual value and the fair market value of each underlying asset as of the lease termination date. as of december 31, 2014, the maximum guaranteed residual value was approximately $434.2 million. we believe that no significant payments will be made as a result of the difference between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the guaranteed residual value. however, there can be no assurance that future significant payments will not be required.
letters of credit certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf, such as to beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance programs. in addition, from time to time, certain customers require us to post letters of credit to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to guarantee performance under our contracts. such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution, typically pursuant to our credit agreement. each letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder claims that we have failed to perform specified actions. if this were to occur, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement, we may also be required to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. we do not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future.
as of december 31, 2014, we had $336.7 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees to secure our casualty insurance program and various contractual commitments. these are irrevocable stand-by letters of credit with maturities generally expiring at various times throughout 2015. upon maturity, it is expected that the majority of the letters of credit related to the casualty insurance program will be renewed for subsequent one-year periods.
performance bonds and parent guarantees many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety. these bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. if we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. we must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs. under our underwriting, continuing indemnity and security agreement with our sureties and with the consent of the lenders that are party to our credit agreement, we have granted security interests in certain of our assets to collateralize our obligations to the sureties. subject to certain conditions and consistent with terms of our credit agreement, these security interests will be automatically released if we maintain a corporate credit rating that is bbb- (stable) or higher by standard & poors rating services and a corporate family rating that is baa3 (stable) or higher by moodys investors services. we may be required to post letters of credit or other collateral in favor of the sureties or our customers in the future. posting letters of credit in favor of the sureties or our customers would reduce the borrowing availability under our credit facility. to date, we have not been required to make any reimbursements to our sureties for bond-related costs. we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund significant claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future. as of december 31, 2014, the total amount of outstanding performance bonds was estimated to be approximately $2.8 billion. our estimated maximum exposure as it relates to the value of bonds outstanding is lowered on each bonded project as the cost to complete is reduced, and each of our commitments under the performance bonds
57
generally extinguishes concurrently with the expiration of our related contractual obligation. the estimated cost to complete these bonded projects was estimated to be approximately $701 million as of december 31, 2014.
from time to time, we guarantee the obligations of our wholly owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease obligations, certain joint venture arrangements and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors licenses. we are not aware of any material obligations for performance or payment asserted against us under any of these guarantees.
contractual obligations as of december 31, 2014, our future contractual obligations were as follows (in thousands):

(1)   amounts are recorded in our december 31, 2014 consolidated balance sheet.

(2)   a return of capital from unconsolidated affiliates of approximately $52.9 million is anticipated in august 2017.

fiber optic networks commitments the committed capital expenditures for fiber optic networks represent commitments related to signed contracts with customers. the amounts are estimates of costs required to build the networks under contract. the actual capital expenditures related to building the networks could vary materially from these estimates. we have also committed capital for the expansion of our vehicle fleet in order to accommodate manufacturer lead times on certain types of vehicles. as of december 31, 2014, production orders for approximately $5.6 million had been issued with delivery dates scheduled to occur throughout 2015. although we have committed to the purchase of these vehicles at the time of their delivery, we intend that these orders will be assigned to third party leasing companies and made available to us under certain of our master equipment lease agreements, which will release us from our capital commitment.
unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2014, the total unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions was $51.1 million. we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service for calendar years 2011 and 2012. additionally, certain of our subsidiaries are under examination by various u.s. state, canadian and other foreign tax authorities for multiple periods, and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could therefore increase or decrease as a result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations periods or settlements of these examinations. we believe it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $10.3 million due to the expiration of certain statute of limitations periods or settlements of the examinations.

multi-employer pension plans the previously presented table of estimated contractual obligations does not reflect the obligations under the multi-employer pension plans in which our union employees participate. some of our operating units are parties to various collective bargaining agreements that require us to provide to the employees subject to these agreements specified wages and benefits, as well as to make contributions to multi-employer pension plans. our multi-employer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the collective bargaining agreements (usually on an annual basis), and contributions are made to the plans on a pay-as-you-go basis based on our union employee payrolls. the location and number of union employees that we employ at any given time and the plans in which they may participate vary depending on the projects we have ongoing at any time and the need for union resources in connection with those projects. therefore, we are unable to accurately predict our union employee payroll and the amount of the resulting multi-employer pension plan contribution obligation for future periods.
we may also have additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of our participation in multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended by the multi-employer pension plan amendments act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a multi-employer plan if the employer withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. these liabilities include an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits in the plan for all plan participants, not merely the benefits payable to a contributing employers own retirees. other than as noted below, we are not aware of any material amounts of withdrawal liability that have been or are expected to be incurred as a result of a withdrawal by any of our operating units from any multi-employer defined benefit pension plans.
we may also be required to make additional contributions to our multi-employer pension plans if they become underfunded, and these additional contributions will be determined based on our union employee payrolls. the pension protection act of 2006 added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as endangered, seriously endangered or critical status. plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. a number of multi-employer plans to which our operating units contribute or may contribute in the future are in endangered, seriously endangered or critical status. the amount of additional funds, if any, that we may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be reasonably estimated and is not included in the above table due to uncertainty of the future levels of work that require the specific use of the union employees covered by these plans, as well as the future contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions applicable to these plans.
we recorded a partial withdrawal liability of approximately $32.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the withdrawal by certain of our subsidiaries from the central states plan. the partial withdrawal liability we recognized was based on estimates received from the central states plan during 2011 for a complete withdrawal by all of our subsidiaries participating in the central states plan. the central states plan asserted that the withdrawal of the plca members was not effective in 2011, although we believed at that time that a legally effective withdrawal had occurred during the fourth quarter of 2011. although the federal district court of northern illinois, eastern division, ruled that the withdrawal of the plca members was not effective in 2011, the plca appealed the decision, and the outcome of that appeal remains uncertain. certain of our subsidiaries continued participation in the central states plan, and we believe we subsequently effected a complete withdrawal as of december 30, 2012.
in december 2013, the central states plan filed separate lawsuits against two of our subsidiaries. in the first lawsuit, the central states plan alleged that one of our subsidiaries elected to participate in the central states plan pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement under which it participates. the subsidiary argued that no
59
such election was made and that any payments made by the subsidiary to the central states plan were made in error. the parties recently reached an agreement in principle to settle this lawsuit, pursuant to which, among other things, the central states plan agreed to return the payments made by the subsidiary. in the second lawsuit, the central states plan alleges that contributions made by another one of our subsidiaries to a new industry fund that was created after we withdrew from the central states plan should have been made to the central states plan. this arguably would extend the date of withdrawal for this subsidiary to 2014. we have disputed these allegations on the basis that we have properly paid contributions to the new industry fund based on the terms of the collective bargaining agreement under which we participate.
in march 2014, one of our subsidiaries was notified of a joint grievance committee decision relating to a separate grievance matter concluding that our subsidiary should have hired teamsters under a specific collective bargaining agreement to perform certain jobs. this matter was subsequently resolved with the teamsters, effectively resulting in an award of wages and benefits (including pension contributions) to the two teamsters employees under an alternate collective bargaining agreement that is not related to the central states plan. in addition, in march 2014 the central states plan provided revised estimates indicating that the withdrawal liability based on certain withdrawal scenarios from 2011 through 2014 could range between $40.1 million and $55.4 million. in july 2014, the central states plan provided us with a notice and demand of partial withdrawal liability for certain of our subsidiaries in the amount of $39.6 million. we continue to dispute the total withdrawal liability owed to the central states plan. however, monthly payments associated with this notice and demand began in the third quarter of 2014, and the parties continue the process to determine the final withdrawal liability. the amount owed upon resolution of this matter will be reduced by the payments made.
the ultimate liability associated with the complete withdrawal of our subsidiaries from the central states plan will depend on various factors, including interpretations of the terms of the collective bargaining agreements under which the subsidiaries participated and whether exemptions from withdrawal liability applicable to construction industry employers will be available. based on the previous estimates of liability associated with a complete withdrawal from the central states plan, and allowing for the exclusion of amounts we believe have been improperly included in such estimate, we will seek to challenge and further negotiate the amount owed in connection with this matter. however, we recorded an adjustment to cost of services during the three months ended march 31, 2014 to increase the recognized withdrawal liability to an amount within the range communicated to us by the central states plan. we believe that the range of reasonable possible loss associated with the central states plan is up to $55.4 million. given the unknown nature of some of the factors mentioned above, the final withdrawal liability cannot yet be determined with certainty. accordingly, it is reasonably possible that the amount owed upon final resolution of these matters could be materially higher than the liability we have recognized through december 31, 2014.
on october 9, 2013, we acquired a company that experienced a complete withdrawal from the central states plan prior to the date of our acquisition. the central states plan issued a notice and demand dated march 13, 2013 to the acquired company for a withdrawal liability in the total amount of $6.9 million payable in installments. based on legal arguments, the acquired company took the position that the amount of withdrawal liability payable to the central states plan as a result of its complete withdrawal was $4.8 million, of which approximately $3.1 million remained outstanding as of december 31, 2014. the acquired company and quanta have taken steps to challenge the amount of the assessment by the central states plan; however, payments in accordance with the terms of the central states plans demand letter are required to be made while the dispute process is ongoing. approximately $2.1 million of the purchase price was deposited into an escrow account on october 9, 2013 to fund any withdrawal obligation in excess of the $4.8 million initially demanded. accordingly, the acquired companys withdrawal from the central states plan is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
for a more complete description of our obligations with respect to multi-employer pension plans, see collective bargaining agreements in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8.
60
letters of credit fees and commitment fees also excluded from the contractual obligations table is interest associated with letters of credit fees and commitment fees under our credit facility because the outstanding letters of credit, availability and applicable interest rates and fees are variable. for additional information regarding the interest rates associated with borrowings under our credit facility, see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report.
joint venture capital commitments we have also excluded from the contractual obligations table additional capital commitments associated with investments in unconsolidated affiliates related to planned midstream infrastructure projects of approximately $9.3 million because we are unable to determine the exact timing of these capital commitments but anticipate them to be paid by june 1, 2017. as specific amounts of capital commitments and their timing are determined, we will reflect such amounts in the contractual obligations table.
self-insurance we are insured for employers liability, general liability, auto liability and workers compensation claims. under these programs, the deductibles were $10.0 million per occurrence for general liability and auto liability, $5.0 million per occurrence for workers compensation, and $1.0 million per occurrence for employers liability for the policy years 2014-2015 and 2013-2014. for the 2012-2013 policy year, the deductibles were $5.0 million per occurrence for general liability, auto liability and workers compensation and $1.0 million per occurrence for employers liability . we are generally self-insured for all claims that do not exceed the amount of the applicable deductible. in connection with our casualty insurance programs, we are required to issue letters of credit to secure our self insured obligations. we also have employee health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $375,000 per claimant per year.
losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. these insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. the accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $170.2 million and $161.8 million, with $130.8 million and $122.6 million considered to be long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. related insurance recoveries/receivables as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 were $9.1 million and $9.1 million, of which $0.8 million and $0.7 million were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $8.3 million and $8.4 million were included in other assets, net.
we renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may change in future periods. in addition, insurers may cancel our coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or we may elect not to obtain certain types or incremental levels of insurance if we believe that the cost to obtain such coverage exceeds the additional benefits obtained. in any such event, our overall risk exposure would increase, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
concentrations of credit risk we are subject to concentrations of credit risk related primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and our accounts receivable, including amounts related to unbilled accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. substantially all of our cash investments are managed by what we
61
believe to be high credit quality financial institutions. in accordance with our investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest this cash in a diversified portfolio of what we believe to be high quality investments, which primarily include interest-bearing demand deposits, money market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper with original maturities of three months or less. although we do not currently believe the principal amount of these investments is subject to any material risk of loss, changes in economic conditions could impact the interest income we receive from these investments. in addition, we grant credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include electric power, oil and gas companies, governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the united states, canada and australia. consequently, we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the united states, canada and australia, which may be heightened as a result of uncertain economic and financial market conditions that have existed in recent years. however, we generally have certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. historically, some of our customers have experienced significant financial difficulties, and others may experience financial difficulties in the future. these difficulties expose us to increased risk related to collectability of billed and unbilled receivables and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts for services we have performed.
as of december 31, 2013, two customers accounted for approximately 15% and 11% of consolidated net position. the services provided to these customers related primarily to our electric power infrastructure services segment. substantially all of the balance for the customer accounting for 11% of our consolidated net position at december 31, 2013 related to the sunrise powerlink project, which had a long-term receivable balance related to a significant change order. this receivable was the subject of an arbitration proceeding that was dismissed in january 2015 pursuant to a december 2014 settlement agreement. for additional information, see legal proceedings and critical accounting policies  current and long-term accounts and notes receivable and allowances for doubtful accounts below. no other customers represented 10% or more of our consolidated net position as of december 31, 2013. no customers represented 10% or more of our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 or 10% or more of our consolidated net position as of december 31, 2014.
legal proceedings we are from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. these actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract and/or property damages, employment-related damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. with respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record a reserve when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. in addition, we disclose matters for which management believes a material loss is at least reasonably possible. see legal proceedings and collective bargaining agreements in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding litigation, claims and other legal proceedings, including our partial withdrawal liability under the central states plan.
sunrise powerlink arbitration. on april 21, 2010, par electrical contractors, inc. (par), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into a contract with san diego gas & electric company (sdg&e) to construct a 117-mile electrical transmission line in imperial and san diego counties, california, known as the sunrise powerlink project. construction commenced on november 17, 2010, with commercial operations beginning on june 17, 2012. we alleged that during the construction phase, sdg&e directed multiple changes to the construction schedule that required us to significantly increase our resources to the project in order to meet sdg&es required completion date. further, we contended that the project experienced numerous impacts beyond our control such as access delays and restrictions, as well as problems with customer supplied materials to the project. following completion of the project, we had multiple meetings with sdg&e to review project scope, costs and performance criteria in an attempt to resolve the amount owed to us. sdg&e also conducted an audit of our records, which resulted in confirmation of our direct costs incurred in completing the project, but not
62
a resolution of the final amount owed to us. we previously recorded a long-term contract receivable in the amount of approximately $165 million in connection with contract price adjustments related to the sunrise powerlink project.
in october 2013, we initiated arbitration proceedings against sdg&e alleging breach of contract and seeking compensation for our additional costs incurred on the project. sdg&e filed a counterclaim for breach of contract seeking approximately $32 million for our alleged untimely performance. during the third quarter of 2014, we evaluated the legal theories and strategies most advantageous to pursue relative to our position in the arbitration at the time, which resulted in a change in our expected strategy for collecting the receivable. this change in approach caused us to revise our estimate of expected outcomes and to record an adjustment to the net realizable value of the long-term contract receivable. a provision of $52.5 million was recognized in the three months ended september 30, 2014 as a charge to selling, general and administrative expense to reflect the impact of these changes in our assessment of the collectability of this long-term receivable. we also amended our arbitration demand in october 2014 and asserted a claim for damages in excess of $113 million including interest and other relief to which we were entitled.
in december 2014, the parties reached an agreement to dismiss the arbitration. the settlement terms provided for a cash payment by sdg&e to us in the amount of $65 million, representing the final amount to compensate us for substantially all of the unpaid portion of our costs incurred on the project. as a result, an additional provision of $49.9 million was recognized in the three months ended december 31, 2014 as a charge to selling, general and administrative expense to reflect the impact of this settlement. payment was received in january 2015, and the arbitration was dismissed shortly thereafter.
related party transactions in the normal course of business, we enter into transactions from time to time with related parties. these transactions typically take the form of facility leases with prior owners of certain acquired companies.
inflation due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, inflation did not have a significant effect on our results.
new accounting pronouncements adoption of new accounting pronouncements on january 1, 2014, we adopted an update that provides guidance on the balance sheet presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward exists as of the reporting date. the update is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2013. the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
accounting standards not yet adopted in april 2014, the fasb issued an update that changes the requirement for reporting discontinued operations. a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity will be required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results when the entity or group of components of an entity meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale or when it is disposed of by sale or other than by sale. the update also requires additional disclosures about discontinued operations, a disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the financial statements, and an entitys significant continuing involvement with a discontinued operation. the update is effective prospectively
63
for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15, 2014, including interim periods within those years. early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in previously issued financial statements. we adopted this guidance effective january 1, 2015. this guidance will impact the disclosure and presentation of how we report any future disposals of components or groups of components of our business.
in may 2014, the fasb issued an update that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance as well as some cost recognition guidance. the update requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. this update also requires new qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, information about contract balances and performance obligations, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. for public entities, the update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year. the guidance can be applied on a full retrospective or modified retrospective basis whereby the entity records a cumulative effect of initially applying this update at the date of initial application, and early adoption is not permitted. we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this authoritative guidance on our consolidated financial statements and are planning to adopt this guidance effective january 1, 2017.
in august 2014, the fasb issued guidance to address the diversity in practice in determining when there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern and when and how an entity must disclose certain relevant conditions and events. this update requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). if such conditions or events exist, an entity should disclose that there is substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued), along with the principal conditions or events that raise substantial doubt, managements evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entitys ability to meet its obligations and managements plans that are intended to mitigate those conditions or events. the guidance is effective for annual and interim periods ending after december 15, 2016. this guidance will impact the disclosure and presentation of how we report any substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, if such substantial doubt were to exist. quanta will adopt this guidance effective january 1, 2017.
in february 2015, the fasb issued an update which amends existing consolidation guidance, including amending the guidance related to determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity. the update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015, although early adoption is permitted. the guidance may be applied using a modified retrospective approach whereby the entity records a cumulative effect of adoption at the beginning of the fiscal year of initial application. a reporting entity may also apply the amendments on a full retrospective basis. we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this authoritative guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are published and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented. we review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their publication. judgments and estimates are based on our beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time such judgments and estimates are made. uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements. there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. management has reviewed its development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the
64
audit committee of our board of directors. we believe the following accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
revenue recognition infrastructure services  through our electric power infrastructure services and oil and gas infrastructure services segments, we design, install and maintain networks for customers in the electric power and oil and gas industries. these services may be provided pursuant to master service agreements, repair and maintenance contracts and fixed price and non-fixed price installation contracts. pricing under these contracts may be competitive unit price, cost-plus/hourly (or time and materials basis) or fixed price (or lump sum basis), and the final terms and prices of these contracts are frequently negotiated with the customer. under unit-based contracts, the utilization of an output-based measurement is appropriate for revenue recognition. under these contracts, we recognize revenue as units are completed based on pricing established between us and the customer for each unit of delivery, which best reflects the pattern in which the obligation to the customer is fulfilled. under our cost-plus/hourly and time and materials type contracts, we recognize revenue on an input basis, as labor hours are incurred and services are performed.
revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract. these contracts provide for a fixed amount of revenues for the entire project. such contracts provide that the customer accept completion of progress to date and compensate us for services rendered, which may be measured in terms of units installed, hours expended or some other measure of progress. contract costs include all direct materials, labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. much of the material associated with our work is owner-furnished and is therefore not included in contract revenues and costs. the cost estimation process is based on professional knowledge and experience of our engineers, project managers and financial professionals. changes in job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence managements assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts and therefore, our profit recognition. changes in these factors may result in revisions to costs and income, and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. these factors are routinely evaluated on a project by project basis throughout the project term, and the impact of corresponding revisions in managements estimates of contract value, contract cost and contract profit are recorded as necessary in the period in which the revisions are determined. provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. if actual results significantly differ from our estimates used for revenue recognition and claim assessments, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted. our operating results for the year ended december 31, 2014 were impacted by less than 5% as a result of changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at december 31, 2013.
the current asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed price contracts. the current liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenues recognized for fixed price contracts.
we may incur costs subject to change orders, whether approved or unapproved by the customer, and/or claims related to certain contracts. we determine the probability that such costs will be recovered based upon evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer or verbal approvals. we treat items as a cost of contract performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that the costs will be recovered or will recognize revenue if it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be reliably estimated.
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had approximately $106.8 million and $75.5 million of change orders and/or claims that had been included as contract price adjustments on certain contracts which were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business.
65
as of december 31, 2013 and throughout most of 2014, we also had previously recognized contract price adjustments related to a change order from the sunrise powerlink project of approximately $165 million. in october 2013, we initiated arbitration proceedings against sdg&e pursuant to a contractually agreed upon dispute resolution process to collect amounts due for this project. in december 2014, the parties reached an agreement to settle the arbitration under terms providing for a cash payment by sdg&e in the amount of $65 million, representing the final amount to compensate us for substantially all of the unpaid portion of the costs incurred by us on the project. during the third and fourth quarters of 2014, we recorded a provision in the aggregate amount of $102.5 million against the recorded value of this asset. see liquidity and capital resources  legal proceedings  sunrise powerlink arbitration above for additional information.
these aggregate contract price adjustments represent managements best estimate of additional contract revenues which have been earned and which management believes are probable of collection. the amounts ultimately realized by us upon final acceptance by our customers could be higher or lower than such estimated amounts.
fiber optic licensing  the fiber optic licensing business constructs and licenses the right to use fiber optic telecommunications facilities to its customers pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with terms from five to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal options. under those agreements, customers are provided the right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic facility, with the facility owned and maintained by us. revenues, including any initial fees or advance billings, are recognized ratably over the expected length of the agreements, including probable renewal periods. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, initial fees and advance billings on these licensing agreements not yet recorded in revenue were $56.5 million and $48.8 million and are recognized as deferred revenue, with $48.2 million and $40.2 million considered to be long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. actual revenues may differ from those estimates if the contracts are not renewed as expected.
self-insurance. as discussed in liquidity and capital resources  self-insurance, we are insured for employers liability, general liability, auto liability and workers compensation claims.
losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. these insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. the accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $170.2 million and $161.8 million with $130.8 million and $122.6 million considered to be long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. related insurance recoveries/receivables as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 were $9.1 million and $9.1 million, of which $0.8 million and $0.7 million were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $8.3 million and $8.4 million were included in other assets, net.
valuation of goodwill. we have recorded goodwill in connection with our historical acquisitions of companies. upon acquisition, these companies have been either combined into one of our existing operating units or managed on a stand-alone basis as an individual operating unit. goodwill recorded in connection with these acquisitions is subject to an annual assessment for impairment, which we perform at the operating unit level for each operating unit that carries a balance of goodwill. each of our operating units is organized into one of three internal divisions: the electric power division, the oil and gas infrastructure division or the fiber optic licensing division. as most of the companies acquired by us provide multiple types of services for multiple types of customers, these divisional designations are based on the predominant type of work performed by each operating unit at the point in time the divisional designation is made. goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available, and we have determined that our individual operating units represent our reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill impairments.
66
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step fair value-based impairment test described below. if we believe that, as a result of our qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. otherwise, no further testing is required. we can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of our reporting units. we can also bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. qualitative indicators including deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, declining financial performance, or a sustained decrease in share price, among other things, may trigger the need for annual or interim impairment testing of goodwill associated with one or all of the reporting units.
our goodwill impairment assessment is performed annually at year-end, or more frequently if events or circumstances arise which indicate that goodwill may be impaired. for instance, a decrease in our market capitalization below book value, a significant change in business climate or loss of a significant customer, as well as the qualitative indicators referenced above, may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of goodwill for one or all of our reporting units. the first step of the two-step fair value-based test involves comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying value, including goodwill. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. the second step compares the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill to the implied fair value of its goodwill. if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction to goodwill with a corresponding charge to operating expense.
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighted combination of the discounted cash flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches, with heavier weighting on the discounted cash flow method, as in managements opinion, this method currently results in the most accurate calculation of a reporting units fair value. determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. such estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average costs of capital and future market conditions, among others. we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated.
under the discounted cash flow method, we determine fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted to present value using risk-adjusted industry discount rates, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. cash flow projections are derived from budgeted amounts and operating forecasts (typically a one-year model) plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which are evaluated by management. subsequent period cash flows are developed for each reporting unit using growth rates that management believes are reasonably likely to occur, along with a terminal value derived from the reporting units earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda). the ebitda multiples for each reporting unit are based on trailing twelve-month comparable industry data.
under the market multiple and market capitalization approaches, we determine the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units by applying transaction multiples to each reporting units projected ebitda and then averaging that estimate with similar historical calculations using either a one, two or three year average. for the market capitalization approach, we add a reasonable control premium, which is estimated as the premium that would be received in a sale of the reporting unit in an orderly transaction between market participants.
67
the projected cash flows and estimated levels of ebitda by reporting unit were used to determine fair value under the three approaches discussed herein. the following table presents the significant estimates used by management in determining the fair values of our reporting units at december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012:
operating units providing predominantly                operating unit providing electric power and oil and gas                   fiber optic licensing infrastructure services

market multiple                                         15%                    15%                    15%          5%            5%            5%
market capitalization                                   15%                    15%                    15%          5%            5%            5%
for recently acquired reporting units, a step one impairment test may indicate an implied fair value that is substantially similar to the reporting units carrying value. such similarities in value are generally an indication that managements estimates of future cash flows associated with the recently acquired reporting unit remain relatively consistent with the assumptions that were used to derive its initial fair value.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, a two-step fair-value based goodwill impairment analysis was performed for each of our reporting units, and no reporting units, other than recently acquired reporting units, were evaluated solely on a qualitative basis. the analysis indicated that the implied fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value. following the analysis, management concluded that no impairment was indicated at any reporting unit. as discussed generally above, when evaluating the 2014 step one impairment test results, management considered many factors in determining whether or not an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit was reasonably likely to occur in future periods, including future market conditions and the economic environment in which our reporting units were operating. additionally, management considered the sensitivity of its fair value estimates to changes in certain valuation assumptions and, after giving consideration to at least a 10% decrease in the fair value of each of our reporting units, the results of the assessment at december 31, 2014 did not change. however, circumstances such as market declines, unfavorable economic conditions (including sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices), the loss of a major customer or other factors could impact the valuation of goodwill in future periods.
the goodwill analysis performed for each reporting unit was based on estimates and industry comparables obtained from the electric power, oil and gas and fiber optic licensing industries, and no impairment was indicated. the 15-year discounted cash flow model used for fiber optic licensing was based on the long-term nature of the underlying fiber optic network licensing agreements.
we assigned a higher weighting to the discounted cash flow approach in all periods to reflect increased expectations of market value being determined from a held and used model. as stated previously, cash flows are derived from budgeted amounts and operating forecasts that have been evaluated by management. in connection with the 2014 assessment, projected annual growth rates by reporting unit varied widely with ranges from 0% to 71% for reporting units in the electric power division and the oil and gas infrastructure division and 4% to 12% for the reporting unit in fiber optic licensing division.
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. changes in our judgments and projections could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of reporting units and intangible assets and could result in an impairment. variances in the assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, cost of capital, growth rates and acquisition multiples applied could have an impact on the assessment of impairments and any amount of goodwill impairment charges
68
recorded. for example, lower growth rates, lower acquisition multiples or higher costs of capital assumptions would all individually lead to lower fair value assessments and potentially increased frequency or size of goodwill impairments. any goodwill or other intangible impairment would be included in the consolidated statements of operations.
based on the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis, we compared the sum of fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization at december 31, 2014 and determined that the excess of the aggregate fair value of all reporting units to our market capitalization reflected a reasonable control premium. our market capitalization at december 31, 2014 was approximately $5.99 billion, and our total stockholders equity was approximately $4.51 billion. we determined that there was no goodwill impairment at december 31, 2014. increases in the carrying value of individual reporting units that may be indicated by our impairment tests are not recorded, therefore we may record goodwill impairments in the future, even when the aggregate fair value of our reporting units as a whole may increase.
we and our customers continue to operate in an uncertain business environment, with increasing regulatory requirements and only gradual recovery in the economy from recessionary levels. we are closely monitoring our customers and the effect that changes in economic and market conditions have had or may have on them. certain of our customers have reduced spending in recent years, which we attribute to the negative economic and market conditions, and we anticipate that these negative conditions may continue to affect demand for some of our services in the near-term. we continue to evaluate the impact of the economic environment on our reporting units and the valuation of recorded goodwill. although we are not aware of circumstances that would lead to a goodwill impairment at a reporting unit currently, circumstances such as a continued market decline, the loss of a major customer or other factors could impact the valuation of goodwill in the future.
our goodwill is included in multiple reporting units. due to the cyclical nature of our business, and the other factors described under risk factors in item 1a, the profitability of our individual reporting units may suffer from downturns in customer demand and other factors. these factors may have a disproportionate impact on the individual reporting units as compared to quanta as a whole and might adversely affect such fair value of individual reporting units. if material adverse conditions occur that impact our reporting units, our future estimates of fair value may not support the carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units, and the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered recoverable.
valuation of other intangibles. our intangible assets include customer relationships, backlog, trade names, non-compete agreements, patented rights and developed technology, all subject to amortization, along with other intangible assets not subject to amortization. the value of customer relationships is estimated as of the date a business is acquired based on the value-in-use concept utilizing the income approach, specifically the excess earnings method. the excess earnings analysis consists of discounting to present value the projected cash flows attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration given to customer contract renewals, the importance or lack thereof of existing customer relationships to our business plan, income taxes and required rates of return. we value backlog for acquired businesses as of the acquisition date based upon the contractual nature of the backlog within each service line, using the income approach to discount back to present value the cash flows attributable to the backlog. the value of trade names is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. this approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this intangible asset.
we amortize intangible assets based upon the estimated consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset or on a straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. for instance, a significant change in business climate or a loss of a significant customer, among other things, may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of intangible assets. an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
69
valuation of long-lived assets. we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable. if an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the assets carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary. this requires us to make long-term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future market conditions. estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and our projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized. future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. the effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value. such expense would be reflected in income (loss) from operations in the consolidated statements of operations. in addition, we estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets and other intangibles and periodically review these estimates to determine whether these lives are appropriate.
current and long-term accounts and notes receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts. we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account or note receivable is considered doubtful, and receivables are written off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible. inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates regarding, among other factors, our customers access to capital, our customers willingness or ability to pay, general economic and market conditions, the ongoing relationship with the customer and uncertainties related to the resolution of disputed matters. we consider accounts receivable delinquent after 30 days but do not generally include delinquent accounts in our analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts unless the accounts receivable have been outstanding for at least 90 days. in addition to balances that have been outstanding for 90 days or more, we also include accounts receivable balances that relate to customers in bankruptcy or with other known difficulties in our analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts. material changes in our customers business or cash flows, which may be impacted by negative economic and market conditions, could affect our ability to collect amounts due from them.
long-term accounts receivable are included within other assets, net on our consolidated balance sheets. within this balance at december 31, 2013 was a long-term contract receivable previously recorded in the amount of approximately $165 million attributable to recognized contract price adjustments related to a change order from the sunrise powerlink project, an electric power infrastructure services project completed in 2012 by par for sdg&e. this receivable was the subject of a recently settled arbitration proceeding discussed further in legal proceedings  sunrise powerlink arbitration above. in december 2014, the parties reached an agreement to settle the arbitration under terms providing for a cash payment by sdg&e to us in the amount of $65 million, representing the final amount to compensate us for substantially all of the unpaid portion of our costs incurred on the project. accordingly, a provision of $102.5 million was recognized in 2014 as a charge to selling, general and administrative expense, and the remaining balance of $65 million was reclassified to accounts receivable leaving no balance remaining in other assets, net related to the sunrise powerlink project as of december 31, 2014. payment was received in january 2015, and the arbitration was dismissed shortly thereafter.
should customers experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy, or should anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to materialize, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current allowances provided.
the balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to retainage provisions in certain contracts are generally due upon completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer. based on our experience with similar contracts in recent years, the majority of the retainage balances at each balance sheet date are expected to be collected within the next twelve months. current retainage balances as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $307.3 million and $194.5 million and were included in accounts receivable. retainage balances with settlement dates beyond the next twelve months were included in other assets, net, and as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 were $19.6 million and $50.8 million.
70
within accounts receivable, we recognize unbilled receivables in circumstances such as when revenues have been earned and recorded but the amount cannot be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date; costs have been incurred but are yet to be billed under cost-reimbursement type contracts; or amounts arise from routine lags in billing (for example, work completed one month but not billed until the next month). these balances do not include revenues accrued for work performed under fixed-price contracts as these amounts are recorded as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the balances of unbilled receivables included in accounts receivable were approximately $165.5 million and $179.2 million.
income taxes. we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled.
we regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain. the estimation of required valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable income. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. we consider projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. if actual future taxable income differs from our estimates, we may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent estimated.
we record reserves for income taxes related to certain tax positions in those instances where we consider it more likely than not that additional taxes may be due in excess of amounts reflected on income tax returns filed. when recording reserves for expected tax consequences of uncertain positions, we assume that taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. we continually review exposure to additional tax obligations, and as further information is known or events occur, changes in tax reserves may be recorded. to the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have been accrued and are classified in the provision for income taxes.
the income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and are often ambiguous. as such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our tax positions that could materially affect amounts recognized in our future consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations and comprehensive income.
outlook we believe there are growth opportunities across all the industries we serve. however, we and our customers continue to operate in a somewhat uncertain business environment, with gradual improvement in the economy yet continuing uncertainty in the marketplace. our customers are also facing stringent regulatory and environmental requirements as they implement projects to enhance and expand their infrastructure. more recently, the sharp decline in oil prices could impact certain of our end markets, should prices remain at lower levels for an extended period of time. these economic, regulatory and other factors have negatively affected our results in the past and may continue to create some uncertainty as to the timing of anticipated customer spending. we believe that our financial and operational strengths will enable us to manage these challenges and uncertainties, and we remain optimistic about our near-term and long-term opportunities.
electric power infrastructure services segment the north american electric grid is aging and requires significant upgrades, maintenance and expansion to meet current and future demands for power delivery. over the past several years, many utilities across north america have begun to implement plans to improve their transmission systems in order to improve reliability and reduce congestion. among other things, these activities include new construction, structure change-outs, line
71
upgrades and maintenance projects on many transmission systems. in addition, state renewable portfolio standards, which set required or voluntary standards for how much power is to be generated from renewable energy sources, can result in the need for additional transmission lines and substations to transport the power from these facilities, which are often in remote locations, to demand centers. other factors, such as the reliability standards issued by the north american electric reliability corporation (nerc) and other regulatory actions, are also driving transmission system upgrades and expansions. we believe these factors create significant opportunities for our transmission infrastructure services.
we believe that utilities remain committed to the expansion and strengthening of their transmission infrastructure with planning, engineering and funding for many of their projects in place. the regulatory and environmental permitting processes remain a hurdle for some proposed transmission and renewable energy projects, and these factors continue to create uncertainty as to timing of this spending. the timing and scope of projects can also be affected by other factors such as siting, right-of-way and unfavorable economic and market conditions. we anticipate many of these issues to be overcome and spending on transmission projects to be active over the next few years. we currently have a number of these projects underway, and we expect this segments backlog to remain strong throughout 2015.
several existing, pending or proposed legislative or regulatory actions may also positively affect demand for the services provided by this segment in the long term, particularly in connection with electric power infrastructure and renewable energy spending. for example, legislative or regulatory action that alleviates some of the siting and right-of-way challenges that impact transmission projects would potentially accelerate future transmission line construction. we also anticipate increased infrastructure spending by our customers as a result of regulation requiring the power industry to meet federal reliability standards for its transmission and distribution systems and providing incentives to the industry to invest in and improve maintenance on its systems. developments in environmental regulations concerning fossil fuel power generation plants are resulting in the need to retire or upgrade older coal-fired generation facilities to comply with new environmental and emission rules. much of the electricity previously generated from retired coal-fired generation facilities will be replaced over the coming years by newly developed natural gas-fired generation facilities. we believe this coal to gas dynamic will require old transmission lines to be updated, rebuilt or replaced with higher voltage transmission infrastructure as well as the construction of new transmission infrastructure to connect new natural gas-fired generation facilities to the grid.
the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) issued ferc order no. 1000 to promote more efficient and cost-effective development of new transmission facilities. the order establishes transmission planning and cost allocation requirements intended to facilitate multi-state electric transmission lines and to encourage competition by removing, under certain conditions, federal rights of first refusal from ferc-approved tariffs and agreements. we believe ferc order no. 1000, which was affirmed by ferc in may 2012 with the issuance of ferc order no. 1000-a, has the potential to favorably impact electric transmission line development over time.
we benefited from increases in distribution spending throughout the last four years, despite continued economic and political uncertainties. furthermore, as a result of reduced spending by utilities on their distribution systems during 2009 and 2010, combined with the need to meet reliability requirements, we believe there is an ongoing need for utilities to resume sustained investment in their distribution systems in order to properly maintain their systems. in addition, a number of utilities are implementing system upgrades or hardening programs in response to severe weather events that have occurred over the past few years, which is also increasing distribution investment in some regions of the united states. we also anticipate that utilities will continue to integrate smart grid technologies into their distribution systems over time to improve grid management and create efficiencies. development and installation of smart grid technologies and other energy efficiency initiatives have benefited from stimulus funding under the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009, as well as the implementation of grid management initiatives by utilities and the desire by consumers for more efficient energy use.
72
the economic feasibility of renewable energy projects, and therefore, the attractiveness of investment in the projects, may depend on the availability of tax incentive programs or the ability of the project developer to take advantage of such incentives, and there is no assurance that the government will extend existing tax incentives or create new incentive or funding programs in the future. although we see developments of renewable energy projects, primarily utility-scale solar facilities, which could create increased demand for our engineering, procurement and construction services, we believe there is some uncertainty with these projects advancing towards award and construction.
the need to ensure available specialized labor resources for projects also drives strategic relationships with customers. in addition, several industry and market trends are prompting customers in the electric power industry to seek outsourcing partners. these trends include an aging utility workforce and labor availability issues, increasing pressure to reduce cost and improve reliability, and increasing duration and complexity of customer capital programs. as the economy and financial markets continue to recover, customer demand for labor resources will continue to increase, possibly outpacing the supply of industry resources. as a result, we believe the number of opportunities for strategic partnerships is growing.
oil and gas infrastructure services segment we believe there will continue to be growth opportunities in our oil and gas infrastructure operations, primarily in the installation and maintenance of mainline pipe, gathering systems, production systems and related facilities, as well as pipeline integrity and specialty services such as horizontal directional drilling. we believe opportunities for this segment exist as a result of the increase in the ongoing development of unconventional shale formations in north america that produce natural gas, natural gas liquids and/or crude oil, as well as the development of canadian oil sands and the development of coal seam gas and unconventional shale formations in australia, which will require the construction of mainline pipe infrastructure to connect production with demand centers and the development of midstream gathering infrastructure within areas of production. we also believe the goals of clean energy and energy independence for north america, as well as more stringent environmental regulations, will make abundant, low-cost natural gas the fuel of choice versus coal for power generation over time, creating the need for continued investment in natural gas infrastructure. we believe our position as a leading provider of mainline pipe and gathering system infrastructure services in north america and australia will allow us to capitalize on these opportunities.
the oil and gas industry is cyclical and subject to volatility as a result of fluctuations in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil prices. in the past, sustained periods of low prices for these products negatively impacted the development of these natural resources and related infrastructure. in addition, environmental scrutiny, stringent regulatory requirements and cumbersome permitting processes caused delays in some mainline pipe projects during the past several years. these dynamics resulted in below average mainline pipe construction opportunities for us and the industry in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
the lack of mainline pipe opportunities in 2011, 2012 and 2013 negatively impacted our oil and gas infrastructure services segment margins, in part as a result of our inability to adequately cover certain fixed costs. margins for mainline pipe projects are also subject to significant performance risk, which can arise from adverse weather conditions, challenging geography, customer decisions and crew productivity. our specific opportunities in the mainline pipe business are sometimes difficult to predict because of the seasonality of the bidding and construction cycles within the industry.
a number of large mainline pipe projects are in various stages of development from the canadian oil sands and north american shale formations to refineries and other demand centers. many of these projects are still developing, though several mainline projects have been awarded to us and other pipeline construction contractors. given the costs and time required to bring a mainline pipeline project from conception to construction, we believe many of our customers view such projects as important, strategic pieces of infrastructure. industry participants with this view have a long term perspective regarding their needs and are less
73
influenced by short term commodity fluctuations. however, if oil and natural gas prices remained at low levels for a prolonged period, demand for our oil and natural gas infrastructure services could be materially impacted. while there is risk that some of these projects will not occur or could be delayed, we are encouraged by these proposed mainline pipe development plans and the progression of some mainline projects being awarded to contractors, which could create an improved and favorable mainline pipe market in 2015 for us and the industry in north america. a number of the proposed oil mainline projects that are under development have already secured oil production customers under contractual arrangements, making these projects economically viable despite the decline in oil prices. there are also a number of natural gas mainline projects in development and we expect an increase in new proposed natural gas mainline projects over the coming years, which could result in additional demand for our mainline services going forward.
we also believe there are significant mainline pipe opportunities in australia driven by the production of coal seam gas for lng export. a number of lng export facilities are under construction and proposed for development in australia, canada and the united states, and pipelines and related infrastructure will be required to serve these facilities.
our customers continue to invest in the infrastructure needed to support the development of unconventional shale formations. we have established a strong presence in select unconventional shale formations to position us to successfully pursue projects associated with midstream gathering infrastructure development. even though oil prices have declined recently, demand for pipeline services to support shale gathering infrastructure has remained active in the markets we are strategically focused on. however, due to the recent decline in oil prices, we believe demand for midstream gathering infrastructure in some shale formations where oil is the primary product being produced could be negatively impacted if oil prices remain at lower levels for an extended period of time. the majority of our midstream gathering work is performed in shale formations where natural gas is the primary product being produced. over the medium and longer term, however, we believe oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids should achieve prices that support their continued exploitation, which will require additional infrastructure to be built to support increased north american hydrocarbon production.
we have also expanded our service offerings in this segment through several recent acquisitions, including the acquisition of two pipeline construction and related services companies in canada, which has expanded our canadian services capabilities and the acquisition of a mainline construction company in australia, which has different market drivers and seasonality as compared to north america. in addition, our recent acquisitions of companies that provide pipeline logistics services to the natural gas and oil industry in the united states and specialty services to the offshore oil and gas industry further enhance the segments service offerings, customer base and end markets.
we believe there are growth opportunities for some of our other pipeline services. the u.s. department of transportation has implemented significant regulatory legislation through the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration relating to pipeline integrity requirements that we expect will increase the demand for our pipeline integrity, rehabilitation and replacement services over the long-term. as pipeline integrity testing requirements increase in stringency and frequency, we believe more information will be gathered about the condition of the nations pipeline infrastructure and will result in an increase in spending by our customers on pipeline integrity initiatives. we also operate an engineering, research and development business that develops and owns pipeline inspection tools, enhancing our pipeline integrity offerings. we believe that our ability to offer a complete pipeline integrity turnkey solution to pipeline companies and gas utilities provides us an advantageous position in providing these services to our customers. we are also experiencing an increase in demand for our natural gas distribution services as a result of continuing improvement in economic conditions and lower natural gas prices.
we believe there are meaningful long-term opportunities for us to penetrate the offshore and inland water energy markets in providing various infrastructure design, installation and maintenance services primarily to the gulf of mexico region but also in select international markets. the offshore infrastructure service opportunities
74
we see are very similar to what we perform onshore in this segment, and several of our existing onshore customers who also have offshore assets have expressed interest in our ability to provide offshore infrastructure services. demand for offshore energy infrastructure services is similar to that on land, including the need for engineering, construction and maintenance services for new and existing offshore exploration and production platforms. in addition, the majority of the thousands of miles of marine based pipelines and related production facilities are approaching or are beyond the end of their useful lives. we see this as an opportunity to leverage our onshore pipeline integrity services and technology to the offshore markets aging infrastructure. further, new regulations and the more stringent enforcement of existing regulations administered by the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement should create opportunities for offshore energy infrastructure construction, repair and replacement services.
overall, we are optimistic about this segments operations going forward. the recent decline in oil prices could impact demand for some of our infrastructure services if oil prices remain at lower levels. we believe the oil market will naturally correct the current oversupply situation over time and as a result, oil prices could recover to higher levels. the timing of when that process occurs, however, is uncertain. from a medium and longer term perspective, we believe commodity prices will reach higher levels to encourage the development of north american hydrocarbons, leading to demand for our oil and gas infrastructure services. we continue to believe that mainline pipe opportunities can provide strong profitability, although these projects and the profits they generate are often subject to more cyclicality and execution risk than our other service offerings. we have also taken steps to diversify our operations in this segment through other services, such as pipeline integrity, pipeline logistics, and offshore specialty services. we believe these measures, together with the potential for mainline pipe opportunities, will position us for profitable growth in this segment over the long-term.
fiber optic licensing and other segment our fiber optic licensing and other segment is experiencing growth primarily through network expansion, with a focus on markets where secure high-speed networks are important, such as markets where enterprise, telecommunications carriers, educational, financial services and healthcare institutions are prevalent. we continue to see opportunities for growth both in the markets we currently serve and new markets. the education market, which comprises a significant portion of this segments revenue, had been negatively impacted by challenging economic conditions and budgetary constraints. these constraints eased through the end of 2012, and we currently see spending patterns providing renewed opportunities for growth. however, expanding the markets we serve continues to create competitive pressure which may impact this segments prospects for future growth.
we are also expanding our service offerings to provide lit services. for lit services, we procure and own the electronic equipment necessary to make the fiber optic network operational, and we provide network management services to customers. the addressable market opportunity for lit services is larger than the dark fiber services market and we believe providing lit services should enable us to leverage the fiber optic network capacity in our existing and future fiber networks. we have been investing in the necessary people and equipment needed to expand and grow our lit services, and although 2014 was a transition year as we began deploying our lit services offering, we believe lit services will provide attractive growth opportunities.
our fiber optic licensing and other segment typically generates higher margins than our other operations, but we can give no assurance that the fiber optic licensing and other segment margins will continue at historical levels. additionally, we anticipate the need for continued capital expenditures to support the build-out of our networks and growth of this business. the fiber optic licensing and other segment also provides various telecommunications infrastructure services on a limited and ancillary basis, primarily to our customers in the electric power industry. due to the disposition of our telecommunications subsidiaries, telecommunications services are no longer a strategic priority for us. we will continue to provide these services to utility customers on an as needed basis. however, we believe that expected increases in this segments revenues associated with fiber optic licensing services could be offset by decreases in other telecommunications infrastructure service revenues.

conclusion we continue to see growth opportunities in all of the industry segments we serve, despite continuing challenges from restrictive regulatory requirements and uncertain economic conditions. we are benefiting from utilities increased spending on projects to upgrade and expand their electric power transmission infrastructure to improve system reliability and to deliver renewable electricity from new generation sources to demand centers. favorable industry legislation is also creating incentives and a positive environment for utilities to invest in their electrical infrastructure, particularly for transmission infrastructure. additional environmental regulations concerning fossil fuel power generation emissions create opportunities for transmission lines to be updated, rebuilt or replaced due to coal to gas facility replacements. we also expect utilities to outsource more of their work to companies like us, due in part to the challenges associated with their aging workforce. we believe that we remain the partner of choice for many utilities in need of broad infrastructure expertise, specialty equipment and workforce resources, particularly as capital budgets and infrastructure projects have become larger and more complex.
the recent decline in oil prices creates uncertainty in the near term for our oil and gas infrastructure services, should oil prices remain at lower levels. however, we believe near term and longer term dynamics create growth opportunities going forward for our oil and gas infrastructure services operations. we believe that our overall size and breadth of service offerings provide competitive advantages that allow us to leverage opportunities driven by the development and production of resources from north american unconventional shale formations, the canadian oil sands and coal seam gas and unconventional shale formations in australia. development activity in the shale formations in which we are strategically focused remains active, and north american oil and natural gas production is expected to continue to increase, thereby driving demand for gathering system infrastructure. further, we are seeing encouraging indications that increases in mainline pipe project activity in 2013 and 2014 could continue through 2015. we also believe that our strategy to pursue midstream gathering system opportunities in certain unconventional shale formations in the united states, as well as the anticipated increase in demand for our pipeline integrity, rehabilitation and replacement services from pipeline integrity initiatives, and other services in adjacent markets that we have gained through recent acquisitions, will create attractive growth potential for us and also further diversify the services provided by our oil and gas infrastructure services segment in both the near and long term.
our electric distribution and gas distribution services were both significantly affected by the uncertain economic conditions that existed during the prior recession. demand for our electric distribution services has increased over the past several years as the economy has stabilized and spending on maintenance to improve reliability has returned. we are optimistic that continued implementation of electric distribution reliability programs and the potential for improvement in the housing market will facilitate continued growth in demand for our electric distribution services. gas distribution spending has been driven primarily by improving economic conditions and the lower cost of natural gas.
competitive pricing environments, project delays and effects from restrictive regulatory requirements have negatively impacted our margins in the past and could affect our margins in the future. additionally, margins may be negatively impacted on a quarterly basis due to adverse weather conditions, as well as timing of project starts or completions and other factors as described in understanding margins above. we continue to focus on the elements of the business we can control, including costs, the margins we accept on projects, collecting receivables, ensuring quality service, rightsizing initiatives as needed to match the markets we serve, and safely executing on the projects we are awarded.
capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be between $275 million to $300 million, of which approximately $50 million to $60 million of these expenditures are targeted for fiber optic network expansion, with the majority of the remaining expenditures for operating equipment. we expect 2015 capital expenditures to be funded substantially through internal cash flows, cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility.
76
we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions and similar investments to broaden our customer base, expand our geographic area of operation, grow our portfolio of services and increase opportunities across our operations. we believe that additional attractive acquisition candidates exist primarily as a result of the highly fragmented nature of the industry, the inability of many companies to expand and modernize due to capital constraints, and the desire of owners for liquidity. we also believe that our financial strength, entrepreneurial operating model and experienced management team are attractive to acquisition candidates.
certain international regions present significant opportunities for growth over time across many of our operations. we are evaluating ways in which we can strategically apply our expertise to strengthen infrastructure in various foreign countries where infrastructure enhancements are increasingly important. for example, we are actively pursuing opportunities in growth markets where we can leverage our technology or proprietary work methods, such as our energized services, to establish a presence in these markets.
we believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize upon opportunities and trends in the industries we serve because of our full-service operations with broad geographic reach, our financial strength and our technical expertise. additionally, we believe the industry opportunities and trends discussed herein will increase the demand for our services over the long-term, although the actual timing, magnitude and impact of these opportunities and trends on our operating results and financial position is difficult to predict.

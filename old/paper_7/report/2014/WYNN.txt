future development we are currently constructing wynn palace, an integrated resort containing a 1,700-room hotel, performance lake, meeting space, casino, spa, retail offerings and food and beverage outlets in the cotai area of macau. in july 2013, we signed a $2.6 billion gmp contract for the project's construction. the total project budget, including construction costs, capitalized interest, pre-opening expenses, land costs and financing fees, is approximately $4.1 billion. as of december 31, 2014, we have invested approximately $1.8 billion in the project. we expect to open wynn palace in the first half of 2016.
on september 17, 2014, the massachusetts gaming commission designated wynn ma, llc, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company, the award winner of the greater boston (region a) gaming license. on november 4, 2014, a vote upheld the expanded gaming law in massachusetts. on november 7, 2014, the gaming license awarded to us became effective.
on january 2, 2015, we purchased 33 acres of land in everett, massachusetts, along the mystic river. on this land, we intend to develop and operate an integrated resort containing a hotel, restaurants, casino, spa, premium retail offerings, meeting and convention space and a waterfront boardwalk.
we continually seek out new opportunities for additional gaming or related businesses, in the united states, and worldwide.
key operating measures certain key operating measures specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which a consolidated statement of income is presented. below are definitions of these key operating measures discussed:
•   table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue.
•   drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box.
•   turnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our macau operations' vip program.
•   rolling chips are identifiable chips that are used to track turnover for purposes of calculating incentives.
•   slot win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenue.
•   average daily rate ("adr") is calculated by dividing total rooms revenue including the retail value of promotional allowances (less service charges, if any) by total rooms occupied including complimentary rooms.
•   revenue per available room ("revpar") is calculated by dividing total rooms revenue including the retail value of promotional allowances (less service charges, if any) by total rooms available.
•   occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms, including complimentary rooms, by the total rooms available.

below is a discussion of the methodologies used to calculate win percentage at our resorts.
in our vip casino in macau, customers primarily purchase non-negotiable chips, commonly referred to as rolling chips, from the casino cage and there is no deposit into a gaming table drop box from chips purchased from the cage. non-negotiable chips can only be used to make wagers. winning wagers are paid in cash chips. the loss of the non-negotiable chips in the vip casino is recorded as turnover and provides a base for calculating vip casino win percentage. it is customary in macau to measure vip casino play using this rolling chip method. we expect our win as a percentage of turnover in this segment to be within the range of 2.7% to 3.0%.
the measurement base used in the mass market casino in macau is not the same as that used in the vip casino. in our mass market casino in macau, customers may purchase cash chips at either the gaming tables or at the casino cage. the cash used to purchase the cash chips at the gaming tables is deposited into the gaming table's drop box. this is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage in our mass market casino. we do not report an expected range for the win percentage in our mass market casino as chips purchased at the casino cage are excluded from table games drop and distort our expected win percentage. because of the large number of chip purchases occurring at the casino cage, we believe the relevant indicator of volumes in the mass market segment should be table games win.
the measurements in our vip casino and the mass market casino are not comparable as the mass market casino tracks the initial purchase of chips at the table while the measurement method in our vip casino tracks the sum of all losing wagers. accordingly, the base measurement in the vip casino is much larger than the base measurement in the mass market casino. as a result, the expected win percentage with the same amount of gaming win is smaller in the vip casino when compared to the mass market casino.
in las vegas, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables. the cash and net markers used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. this is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage in las vegas. each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. our expected table games win percentage in las vegas is 21% to 24%.

during the year ended december 31, 2013, our net income attributable to wynn resorts, limited was $728.7 million, an increase of 45.1% over the same period of 2012, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $7.17. adjusted property ebitda increased year-over-year by 14.9%, from $1,575.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2012 to $1,810.8 million for the same period of 2013. our results for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the same period of 2012 were primarily driven by an increase of 10.6%, or $365.4 million in casino revenue from our macau operations and an increase of 15.3%, or $90.5 million in casino revenues from our las vegas operations.

net revenues decreased 3.3% to $5,433.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $5,620.9 million for the same period in 2013. the decline in net revenues was primarily driven by a decrease of 5.8%, or $221.1 million in casino revenue from our macau operations, partially offset by an increase of 5.8%, or $51.8 million, in non-casino revenues from our las vegas operations.
non-casino revenues consist of operating revenues from rooms, food and beverage, entertainment, retail and other, less promotional allowances. the following table presents net revenues from our casino revenues and non-casino revenues (in thousands).

casino revenues casino revenues decreased 4.8% to $4,274.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $4,490.6 million in the same period of 2013. our macau operations experienced a year-over-year decrease in casino revenues of 5.8% from $3,807.9 million to $3,586.8 million. the decrease is primarily due to a decrease from our vip gaming operations, partially offset by an increase of 7.1% in table games win percentage from our mass market gaming operations. our vip gaming operations experienced a 12.1% reduction in turnover and a decline in win as a percentage of turnover from 3.01% to 2.82%. las vegas operations were relatively flat year-over-year with casino revenues of $687.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $682.8 million in the same period of 2013.

food and beverage revenues increased 3.1%, or $18.0 million, to $604.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $586.7 million for the same period of 2013. the increase is primarily a result of an increase in revenues at our las vegas operations.
entertainment, retail and other decreased 4.2%, or $17.5 million, to $401.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $418.7 million for the same period of 2013. the decrease is primarily due to a decline in revenue from retail shops at our macau operations.
promotional allowances increased 6.0%, or $21.9 million, to $389.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $367.3 million for the same period of 2013. as a percentage of total casino revenues, promotional allowances were 9.1% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 8.2% for the same period of 2013.
operating costs and expenses operating costs and expenses decreased 3.8%, or $163.5 million, to $4,167.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $4,330.8 million for the same period of 2013. the reduction was primarily driven by decreases of casino expenses and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses and pre-opening costs.
casino expenses decreased 6.3%, or $179.5 million, to $2,667.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $2,846.5 million for the same period of 2013, primarily due to lower gaming taxes from the 39.0% gross win tax incurred at our macau operations. the decline in gaming taxes was commensurate with the 5.8% decrease in casino revenues at our macau operations.
rooms expense increased 11.1%, or $14.8 million, to $148.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $133.5 million for the same period of 2013. the increase is due to certain rooms expense from our las vegas operations to maintain a premium guest experience and expenses associated with the increase in occupancy over the prior year at both our macau and las vegas operations.
food and beverage expenses increased 4.2%, or $13.6 million, to $337.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $323.6 million for the same period of 2013. the increase in food and beverage expenses is primarily a result of higher costs in the current period for entertainment at wynn las vegas nightclubs.
general and administrative expenses increased 9.7%, or $43.7 million, to $492.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $448.8 million in the same period of 2013 primarily from our macau operations. our macau operations experienced an increase compared to the prior year in labor costs, along with certain property maintenance and repair expenses
45
and other miscellaneous items. our macau operations incurred additional general and administrative labor costs associated with a new 2014 bonus program for non-management employees.
pre-opening costs were $30.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $3.2 million for the same period of 2013 and were primarily associated with the design and planning for wynn palace. we expect our pre-opening costs to increase in the future as the construction and development of wynn palace progresses toward the expected completion in the first half of 2016 and with the beginning of development for the wynn resort in massachusetts.
depreciation and amortization decreased 15.3%, or $56.9 million, to $314.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $371.1 million for the same period of 2013 due to certain las vegas operations assets with a five year useful life becoming fully depreciated.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased 5.4%, or $16.0 million, to $315.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, up from $299.0 million for the same period of 2013, attributable to a $39.0 million increase in interest expense partially offset by a $23.0 million increase in capitalized interest. during 2013, we completed issuances of $500 million 4 1/4% senior notes, $600 million 5 1/4% senior notes and exercised our option to increase our macau senior term loan facility by $200 million. during the first quarter of 2014, we issued an additional $750 million of 5 1/4% senior notes. these issuances of long-term debt were partially offset by the principal repayment of $500 million 7 7/8% first mortgage notes through a cash tender offer in may 2013 and redemption of untendered notes in november 2013. in addition, our interest expense associated with our first mortgage notes reduced year-over-year as a result of open market repurchases we made during 2014. capitalized interest increased due to the construction costs of wynn palace. capitalized interest will continue to increase with the ongoing borrowings and construction costs related to wynn palace.
other non-operating income and expenses we incurred a loss of $9.6 million on the extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to a loss of $40.4 million for the same period of 2013. during the year ended december 31, 2014, the loss was due to the premium paid on the purchase of first mortgage notes due in 2020 through open market transactions and the write-off of related unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount. during the year ended december 31, 2013, the loss was primarily from the premium paid in the cash tender offer of our first mortgage notes due in 2017 and the write-off of related unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount.
we incurred a loss of $4.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps compared to a gain of $14.2 million from the increase in fair value for the same period in 2013.
interest income was $20.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $15.7 million for the same period in 2013. during 2014 and 2013, our short-term investment strategy has been to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. the majority of our short-term investments were in time deposits, fixed deposits and money market accounts with a maturity of three months or less.
income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded a tax benefit of $3.8 million and $17.6 million, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our benefit for income taxes primarily relates to a release of valuation allowance on prior year foreign tax credits resulting from the implementation of a tax planning strategy. for the year ended december 31, 2013, our income tax benefit is primarily related to a decrease in our deferred tax liabilities reduced by foreign taxes assessable on the dividends of wynn macau sa. since june 30, 2010, we have no longer considered our portion of the tax earnings and profits of wynn macau, limited to be permanently reinvested. no additional u.s. tax provision has been made with respect to amounts not considered permanently reinvested as we anticipate that u.s. foreign tax credits should be sufficient to eliminate any u.s. tax provision relating to such repatriation. we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences which are considered indefinitely reinvested.
wynn macau sa received an exemption from macau's 12% complementary tax on casino gaming profits through december 31, 2015. accordingly, we were exempt from the payment of $99.4 million and $107.3 million in such taxes during the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. our non-gaming profits remain subject to the macau complementary tax and casino winnings remain subject to the macau special gaming tax and other levies together totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement.

in december 2013, we received notification that for the 2014 tax year we had been accepted for the compliance maintenance phase of the internal revenue service ("irs") compliance assurance program ("cap"), which accelerates irs examination of key transactions with the goal of resolving any issues before the taxpayer files its return. in the compliance maintenance phase, the irs, at its discretion, may reduce the level of review of the taxpayer's tax positions based on the complexity and number of issues, and the taxpayer's history of compliance, cooperation and transparency in the cap.
in february 2014, we received notification that the irs completed its examination of our 2012 u.s. income tax return and had no changes. in december 2014, we received notification that we were accepted into the compliance maintenance phase of cap for the 2015 tax year.
in march 2013, the financial services bureau commenced an examination of the 2009, 2010, and 2011 macau income tax returns of wynn macau sa in december 2014, wynn macau sa reached an agreement with the macau financial services bureau regarding issues raised during its examination. while no additional tax was due as a result of the examination, adjustments were made to wynn macau sa's foreign net operating loss carryforwards. on december 31, 2014, the statute of limitations for the 2009 macau complementary tax return expired.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $231.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $275.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. these amounts represent the noncontrolling interests' share of net income from wynn macau, limited for each year.

entertainment, retail and other revenues were relatively flat at $418.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared $417.2 million for the same period in 2012. an increase in retail revenues at our macau operations from stronger business in leased stores and las vegas operations with the completed reconfiguration of certain stores in our retail area during 2012 was offset by a decrease in entertainment revenues. decline in entertainment revenues was driven by a las vegas show which ended its run in november 2012.
operating costs and expenses operating costs and expenses increased 5.0%, or $205.8 million, to $4,330.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from $4,125.0 million for the same period of 2012.
casino expenses increased 8.4%, or $219.7 million, to $2,846.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from $2,626.8 million for the same period of 2012. the increase was due primarily to higher gaming taxes commensurate with the increase in casino revenue at our las vegas operations and macau operations (where we incur a gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with the concession agreement).
food and beverage expenses increased 4.9%, or $15.2 million, to $323.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from $308.4 million for the same period of 2012. the increase in food and beverage expenses is primarily due to additional nightclub promotional costs at our las vegas operations.
entertainment, retail and other expenses decreased 7.7%, or $14.6 million, to $175.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from $189.8 million for the same period of 2012 due primarily to a las vegas show that ended its run in november 2012.
general and administrative expenses increased 1.6%, or $7.1 million, to $448.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $441.7 million in the same period of 2012. the increase was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of a restricted stock award that was previously granted to our former chief operating officer and increased development costs. the increase was partially offset by higher expenses incurred during the prior year related to the share redemption and litigation with a former shareholder.
49
provision for doubtful accounts decreased 34.3%, or $6.2 million, to $11.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from $18.1 million for the same period of 2012. during years ended 2013 and 2012, we recorded adjustments of $14.9 million and $30.9 million, respectively, to our reserve estimates for casino accounts receivable based on the results of historical collection patterns and current collection trends.
pre-opening costs were $3.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared to $0.5 million for the same period of 2012 and were attributable to wynn palace. we began to incur pre-opening costs during october 2012 related to the design and planning for wynn palace.
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31, 2013, was $371.1 million compared to $373.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. during the construction of our resorts, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. once these resorts opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. in addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangible assets and other assets and adjust them when warranted. the maximum useful life of assets at our macau operations is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in june 2022 and august 2029, respectively. consequently, depreciation related to our macau operations is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to our las vegas operations.
property charges and other property charges and other for the year ended december 31, 2013, was $17.1 million compared to $40.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. for the year ended december 31, 2013, property charges and other related primarily to miscellaneous renovations and abandonments at our resorts, a contract termination fee and entertainment development costs. for the year ended december 31, 2012, property charges and other related primarily to a remodel of a las vegas restaurant, charges related to the cancellation of a las vegas show which ended its run in november 2012, and miscellaneous renovations and abandonments.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest interest expense was $299.0 million, net of capitalized interest of $10.5 million, for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared to $288.8 million, net of capitalized interest of $2.0 million, for the year ended december 31, 2012. our interest expense increased compared to the prior year period primarily due to the issuance of $500 million 4 1/4% senior notes in may 2013 and a full period of expense for the $1.94 billion redemption note and $900 million 5 3/8% first mortgage notes, which were issued in 2012. capitalized interest increased due to the construction costs of wynn palace.
other non-operating costs and expenses interest income was $15.7 million and $12.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. this increase is mainly due to higher cash balances during 2013. during 2013 and 2012, our short-term investment strategy was to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. the majority of our short-term investments were primarily in money market accounts, time deposits and fixed deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
we recorded a gain of $14.2 million and $1.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012, respectively, resulting from the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps during those years.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recognized $40.4 million in loss from extinguishment of debt. on may 22, 2013, wynn las vegas completed the purchase of $274.7 million of the 7 7/8% first mortgage notes due 2017 (the "2017 notes") pursuant to a tender offer for any and all of the 2017 notes. in connection with this tender offer, wynn las vegas, llc paid $19.6 million in consideration to holders who tendered their notes. additionally, wynn las vegas, llc expensed $6.7 million of unamortized financing costs and original issue discount related to the 2017 notes and incurred other fees of approximately $0.3 million related to the tender offer. on november 1, 2013, wynn las vegas, llc redeemed the untendered 2017 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. as a result of the redemption, we incurred redemption fees of $8.9 million and expensed $4.9 million of unamortized financing costs and original issue discount.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we recognized $25.2 million in loss from extinguishment of debt primarily attributable to the amendment of our credit agreements. in march 2012, wynn las vegas, llc entered into an eighth amendment to its amended and restated credit agreement (the "wynn las vegas credit agreement"). in connection with this
50
amendment, wynn las vegas, llc prepaid all term loans under the wynn las vegas credit agreement, terminated all of its revolving credit commitments that were due to expire in 2013, and terminated all but $100 million of its revolving credit commitments expiring in 2015. in connection with this transaction, we expensed deferred financing fees of $4.8 million. additionally, as described in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 8 "long-term debt" to our consolidated financial statements, we amended our wynn macau credit facilities in july 2012. in connection with amending the wynn macau credit facilities, we expensed $17.7 million of deferred financing costs and third party fees.
income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded a tax benefit of $17.6 million, and for the year ended december 31, 2012, we recorded a tax expense of $4.3 million. our income tax benefit was primarily related to a decrease in our deferred tax liabilities reduced by foreign taxes assessable on the dividends of wynn macau sa. since june 30, 2010, we have no longer considered our portion of the tax earnings and profits of wynn macau, limited to be permanently reinvested. no additional u.s. tax provision has been made with respect to amounts not considered permanently reinvested as we anticipate that u.s. foreign tax credits should be sufficient to eliminate any u.s. tax provision relating to such repatriation. we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences which are considered indefinitely reinvested.
on november 30, 2010, wynn macau sa received an exemption from macau's 12% complementary tax on casino gaming profits, thereby exempting the casino gaming profits of wynn macau sa through december 31, 2015. accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of approximately $107.3 million and $87.1 million in such taxes for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. our non-gaming profits remain subject to the macau complementary tax and casino winnings remain subject to the macau special gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement.
in april 2012, the company reached an agreement with the appellate division of the irs regarding issues raised during the examination of the 2006 through 2009 u.s. income tax returns. the settlement with the appellate division did not impact the company's unrecognized tax benefits. the settlement of the 2006 through 2009 examination issues resulted in a cash tax payment of $1.3 million and the utilization of $3.1 million and $0.9 million in foreign tax credit and general business credit carryforwards, respectively.
during december 2012, the irs completed an examination of the company's 2010 u.s. income tax return and had no changes. in may 2013, the company received notification that the irs completed its examination of the company's 2011 u.s. income tax return and had no changes.
in july 2012, the macau financial services bureau commenced an examination of the 2008 macau income tax return of wynn macau sa. in november 2012, the company received the results of the examination. while no additional tax was due, adjustments were made to the company's foreign net operating loss carryforwards.
in january 2013, the macau financial services bureau examined the 2009 and 2010 macau income tax returns of palo, which is a co-holder of the land concession for wynn palace. the exam resulted in no change to the tax returns.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $275.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared to $226.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. these amounts represent the noncontrolling interests' share of net income from wynn macau, limited for each year.

adjusted property ebitda we use adjusted property ebitda to manage the operating results of our segments. adjusted property ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, corporate expenses, intercompany golf course and water rights leases, stock-based compensation, and other non-operating income and expenses, and includes equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates. adjusted property ebitda is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. we use adjusted property ebitda as a measure of the operating performance of our segments and to compare the operating performance of our properties with those of our competitors. we also present adjusted property ebitda because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. gaming companies have historically reported ebitda as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). in order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their ebitda calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. however, adjusted property ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with gaap. unlike net income, adjusted property ebitda does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. we have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property ebitda. also, our calculation of adjusted property ebitda may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
the following table summarizes adjusted property ebitda (in thousands) for our macau and las vegas operations as reviewed by management and summarized in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 18 "segment information." that footnote also presents a reconciliation of adjusted property ebitda to net income.

adjusted property ebitda at our macau operations decreased year-over-year by 5.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 due to decline in vip turnover, partially offset by an increase in table games win from our mass market gaming operations. adjusted property ebitda at our las vegas operations increased year-over-year by 5.9% for the year ended december 31, 2014 driven by our non-casino revenue performance.
adjusted property ebitda at our macau and las vegas operations increased year-over-year by 13.4% and 19.1% for the year ended december 31, 2013, respectively. both benefited from stronger operating results primarily in the casino department due to an increase in table games volume and win percentage.
refer to the discussions above regarding the specific details of our results of operations.
liquidity and capital resources operating activities our operating cash flows primarily consist of our operating income generated by our macau and las vegas operations (excluding depreciation and other non-cash charges), interest paid and earned, and changes in working capital accounts such as receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, and payables. our table games play both in macau and las vegas is a mix of cash play and credit play, while our slot machine play is conducted primarily on a cash basis. a significant portion of our table games revenue is attributable to the play of a limited number of premium international customers that gamble on credit. the ability to collect these gaming receivables may impact our operating cash flow for the period. our rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail, and other revenue is conducted primarily on a cash basis or as a trade receivable. accordingly, operating cash flows will be impacted by changes in operating income and accounts receivables.

net cash provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $1,098.3 million compared to $1,676.6 million provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2013. the decline in cash provided by operations was primarily due to a decrease in our accounts payable, accrued expenses and customer deposits and from a reduction in operating income driven by our casino revenue results. net cash provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $1,676.6 million compared to $1,185.7 million provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2012. cash flow from operations improved due to significant changes in ordinary working capital accounts such as accounts payable and accrued expenses. also benefiting operating cash flow for the year ended december 31, 2013 was increased operating income that was driven primarily by stronger operating results in the casino department.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $1,114.4 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $677.6 million for the same period in 2013. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we had $1,127.0 million in capital expenditures, net of construction payables and retention, primarily for wynn palace construction. in addition, we used $218.9 million in cash for deposits primarily associated with the wynn palace construction and for payment of our massachusetts gaming license. net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 was partially offset by proceeds of $198.9 million provided by restricted cash that we applied to repayment of certain wynn palace related construction and development costs. the primary use of cash for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $506.8 million for capital expenditures related to site preparation costs for wynn palace land and various renovations at our resorts including wynn macau guest room renovations.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2012 was $344.9 million. during 2012, our primary uses were capital expenditures of $241.0 million and the restriction of $99.2 million in proceeds from our debt instruments for the payment of certain wynn palace related construction and development costs. capital expenditures included site preparation costs for the wynn palace land, a one-time payment in consideration of an unrelated third party's relinquishment of certain rights in and future development on the wynn palace land, remodel of two las vegas restaurants and the conversion of certain storage and office areas in macau to two new retail outlets.
financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities was $235.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, mainly due to the payment of dividends of $942.9 million and payments on our long-term debt, primarily offset by proceeds of $755.6 million from the issuance of senior notes and $132.6 million from borrowings, net of repayments, under our wynn macau revolving credit facility. during 2014, we used $98.4 million for open market purchases of principal on our first mortgage notes and $31.5 million for the repayment of remaining principal on our note payable secured by aircraft.
net cash flows used in financing activities of $291.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 was primarily for the payment of dividends of $1,035.0 million and the redemption of first mortgage notes of $500.0 million, offset by proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $1,100.0 million and the increase in our senior term loan facility of $200.0 million.
net cash flows used in financing activities were $382.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, which was primarily attributable to principal payments of $1,022.8 million on term loan facilities and payment of dividends of $955.5 million, partially offset by proceeds of $1,648.6 million from the issuance of first mortgage notes of $900.0 million and proceeds of $748.6 million from the fully funded senior term loan facility.
capital resources at december 31, 2014, we had approximately $2,182.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $250.3 million of available-for-sale investments in domestic debt securities. cash and cash equivalents include cash in bank and fixed deposits, investments in money market funds, domestic and foreign bank time deposits and commercial paper, all with maturities of less than 90 days. of these amounts, wynn macau, limited and its subsidiaries held $1,391.0 million in cash, of which we own 72%. if our portion of this cash was repatriated to the u.s. on december 31, 2014, approximately 72% of this amount would be subject to u.s. tax in the year of repatriation. wynn resorts, limited, which is not a guarantor of the debt of its subsidiaries, held $524.8 million (including cash of its subsidiaries other than those of wynn las vegas, llc and wynn macau, limited) and $250.3 million of cash and available-for-sale investments, respectively. wynn las vegas, llc held cash balances of $266.4 million.
53
we expect that our future cash needs will relate primarily to the funding of our development projects, debt service and retirement, general corporate purposes and enhancements to our operating resorts. we intend to primarily fund our development projects with the available borrowing capacity under our bank credit facilities.
the wynn macau credit facilities consist of a $950 million equivalent fully funded senior secured term loan facility and a $1.55 billion equivalent senior secured revolving credit facility (together, the "wynn macau credit facilities"). borrowings under the wynn macau credit facilities, which consist of both hong kong and united states dollar tranches, will be used to fund the design, development, construction and pre-opening expenses of wynn palace, and for general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2014, the company had $1.42 billion of available borrowing capacity under the senior secured revolving credit facility.
the wynn america credit facilities consist of a $375 million senior secured revolving credit facility and an $875 million delay draw senior secured term loan facility (together, the "wynn america credit facilities"). borrowings under the wynn america credit facilities will be used to fund the design, development, construction and pre-opening expenses of the wynn resort in massachusetts and for other general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2014, there were no amounts drawn under the wynn america credit facilities, however there were outstanding letters of credit totaling $8.9 million reducing the available borrowing capacity to $1.24 billion.
we believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our bank credit facilities and our existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. if any additional financing becomes necessary, we cannot provide assurance that future borrowings will be available.
macau related debt our macau related debt consists of senior notes and the wynn macau credit facilities.
on march 20, 2014, wynn macau, limited ("wml"), an indirect subsidiary of wynn resorts, limited, issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5 1/4% senior notes due 2021 (the "additional 2021 notes"), which were consolidated and form a single series with the $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5 1/4% senior notes due 2021 issued by wml on october 16, 2013 (the "original 2021 notes" and together with the "additional 2021 notes", the "2021 notes"). wml received net proceeds of approximately $748.8 million after adding the original issue premium and deducting commissions and expenses of the offering. wml will use the net proceeds for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes.
the additional 2021 notes have the same terms and conditions as those of the original 2021 notes. the 2021 notes will bear interest at the rate of 5 1/4% per annum and will mature on october 15, 2021. interest on the 2021 notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on april 15 and october 15 of each year, beginning on april 15, 2014. at any time on or before october 14, 2016, wml may redeem the 2021 notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 notes or (b) a "make-whole" amount as determined by an independent investment banker in accordance with the terms of the indenture for the 2021 notes, dated as of october 16, 2013 (the "wml indenture"). in either case, the redemption price would include accrued and unpaid interest. in addition, on or after october 15, 2016, wml may redeem the 2021 notes, in whole or in part, at a premium decreasing annually from 103.94% of the principal amount to zero, plus accrued and unpaid interest. if wml undergoes a change of control (as defined in the wml indenture), it must offer to repurchase the 2021 notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. in addition, the company may redeem the 2021 notes, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in response to any change in or amendment to certain tax laws or tax positions. further, if a holder or beneficial owner of the 2021 notes fails to meet certain requirements imposed by any gaming authority (as defined in the wml indenture), wml may require the holder or beneficial owner to dispose of or redeem its 2021 notes.

the wml indenture contains covenants limiting wml's (and certain of its subsidiaries') ability to, among other things: merge or consolidate with another company; transfer or sell all or substantially all of its properties or assets; and lease all or substantially all of its properties or assets. the terms of the wml indenture contain customary events of default, including, but

("bnu") for the benefit of the macau government. this guarantee assures wynn macau sa's performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of premiums, fines and indemnity for any material failure to perform under the terms of the concession agreement. as of december 31, 2014, the guarantee was in the amount of 300 million macau patacas (approximately $37 million) and will remain at such amount until 180 days after the end of the term of the concession agreement (2022). bnu, as issuer of the guarantee, is currently secured by a second priority security interest in the senior lender collateral package. from and after repayment of all indebtedness under the wynn macau credit facilities, wynn macau sa is obligated to promptly, upon demand by bnu, repay any claim made on the guarantee by the macau government. bnu is paid an annual fee for the guarantee of approximately 2.3 million macau patacas (approximately $0.3 million).
u.s. and corporate related debt our u.s. related debt consists of first mortgage notes, senior notes and the wynn america credit facilities. the corporate related debt consists of the redemption price promissory note ("redemption note").
the first mortgage notes are issued by wynn las vegas, llc and wynn las vegas capital corp., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of wynn resorts, limited (together, the "issuers"). our first mortgage notes are senior obligations of the issuers and are unsecured (except by the first priority pledge by wynn resorts holdings, llc of its equity interests in wynn las vegas, llc (the "holdings pledge"). these issuances rank pari passu in right of payment with each issuance and are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. if the issuers undergo a change of control, they must offer to repurchase the first mortgage notes at 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. the indentures governing the first mortgage notes contain customary negative covenants and financial covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict wynn las vegas, llc's ability to: pay dividends or distributions or repurchase equity; incur additional debt; make investments; create liens on assets to secure debt; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate with another company; transfer and sell assets or create dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries.

in may 2013, the issuers completed the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4 1/4% senior notes due 2023 (the "2023 notes") pursuant to an indenture, dated as of may 22, 2013 (the "2023 indenture"), among the issuers, the guarantors (as defined below) and u.s. bank national association, as trustee. the 2023 notes were issued at par. the issuers used the net proceeds from the 2023 notes to cover the cost of purchasing the 2017 notes tendered in a tender offer. in addition, the issuers satisfied and discharged the 2017 indenture and, in november 2013, used the remaining net proceeds to redeem all of the 2017 notes not previously tendered. in connection with the issuance of the 2023 notes, the company capitalized approximately $4.1 million of financing costs.
the 2023 notes will mature on may 30, 2023 and bear interest at the rate of 4 1/4% per annum. the issuers may, at their option, redeem the 2023 notes, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time prior to their stated maturity. the redemption price for 2023 notes that are redeemed before february 28, 2023 will include a make-whole premium. the 2023 notes are also subject to mandatory redemption requirements imposed by gaming laws and regulations of gaming authorities in nevada.
the 2023 notes are the issuers' senior unsecured obligations and rank pari passu in right of payment with the issuers' first mortgage notes. the 2023 notes are secured by a first priority pledge of the company's equity interests. the equity interests of the company also secure the first mortgage notes. if wynn resorts, limited receives an investment grade rating from one or more ratings agencies, the first priority pledge securing the 2023 notes will be released.
the 2023 notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by all of the issuers' subsidiaries, other than wynn las vegas capital corp. which was a co-issuer (the "guarantors"). the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of the guarantors and rank senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated debt. the guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future liabilities of the guarantors that are not so subordinated and will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of such guarantors' existing and future secured debt (to the extent of the collateral securing such debt).
the 2023 indenture contains covenants limiting the issuers' and the guarantors' ability to create liens on assets to secure debt; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; and merge or consolidate with another company. these covenants are subject to a number of important and significant limitations, qualifications and exceptions.
on november 20, 2014, wynn america, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, and certain subsidiaries of wynn america entered into a $1.25 billion senior secured credit facility. borrowings under the wynn america credit facilities will be used by us primarily to fund the design, development, construction and pre-opening expenses of the wynn resort in massachusetts and for other general corporate purposes.

certain subsidiaries of wynn america will guarantee the obligation of wynn america under the credit facilities. wynn america has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a series of corporate restructurings and related transactions, including receipt of gaming approvals from relevant gaming authorities, pursuant to which wynn las vegas, llc and its subsidiaries will become subsidiaries of wynn las vegas holdings, llc, a direct subsidiary of wynn america (the "wynn las vegas reorganization"). upon the consummation of the wynn las vegas reorganization (including receipt of all approvals required under applicable gaming laws and regulations), wynn las vegas, llc and its subsidiaries shall be restricted subsidiaries under the credit facilities but shall not guarantee the obligations of wynn america until such time, and then only to such extent, as may be permitted by any then existing wynn las vegas, llc's senior secured notes.

the wynn america credit facilities contain customary representation and warranties, events of default and negative and affirmative covenants, including, among other things, limitations on: indebtedness; investments; restricted payments; mergers and acquisitions; payments of indebtedness; negative pledges; liens; transactions with affiliates and sales of assets. in addition, wynn america is subject to financial covenants including maintaining a maximum consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated ebitda, each as defined in the wynn america credit facilities. commencing with the second full fiscal quarter ending after the fiscal quarter in which the opening of the wynn resort in massachusetts occurs, the maximum consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is not to exceed 2.75 to 1. commencing with the first full fiscal quarter ending with the fiscal quarter in which the wynn las vegas reorganization occurs, the minimum consolidated ebitda is not to be less than $200.0 million.
the company has provided a completion guaranty in favor of the lenders under the wynn america credit facilities to support the development and opening of the wynn resort in massachusetts.
wynn america and the guarantors have entered into a security agreement in favor of the lenders under the wynn america credit facilities pursuant to which, subject to certain exceptions, wynn america and the guarantors have pledged all equity interests in the guarantors to the extent permitted by applicable law and granted a first priority security interest in substantially all of the other existing and future assets of the guarantors.
based on the board of director's finding of "unsuitability," on february 18, 2012, we redeemed and canceled aruze's 24,549,222 shares of wynn resorts' common stock. following a finding of "unsuitability," our articles of incorporation authorize redemption at "fair value" of the shares held by unsuitable persons. pursuant to the articles of incorporation, we issued the redemption note to aruze, a former stockholder and related party, in redemption of the shares. the redemption note has a principal amount of approximately $1.94 billion, matures on february 18, 2022 and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum, payable annually in arrears on each anniversary of the date of the redemption note. we may, in our sole and absolute discretion, at any time and from time to time, and without penalty or premium, prepay the whole or any portion of the principal or interest due under the redemption note. in no instance shall any payment obligation under the redemption note be accelerated except in the sole and absolute discretion of wynn resorts or as specifically mandated by law. the indebtedness evidenced by the redemption note, to the prior payment in full of all existing and future obligations of wynn resorts and any of its affiliates in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money of any kind or nature. aruze, universal entertainment corporation and kazuo okada have challenged the redemption of aruze's shares and we are currently involved in litigation with those parties as well as related shareholder derivative litigation. the outcome of these various proceedings cannot be predicted. any adverse judgments or settlements involving payment of a material sum of money could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could expose us to additional claims by third parties, including current or former investors or regulators. any adverse judgments or settlements would reduce our profits and could limit our ability to operate our business. see item 1a-"risk factors", item 3-"legal proceedings" and item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 17 "commitments and contingencies".
other factors affecting liquidity wynn resorts is a holding company and, as a result, our ability to pay dividends is highly dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries' ability to provide funds to us. restrictions imposed by our wynn las vegas, llc, wynn america and wynn macau sa debt instruments restrict our ability to pay dividends. specifically, wynn las vegas, llc and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indentures governing its first mortgage notes from making certain "restricted payments" as defined in the indentures. these restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of wynn las vegas, llc. these restricted payments may not be made unless certain financial and non-financial criteria have been satisfied. the wynn macau credit facilities contain similar restrictions, including a specified leverage ratio, which must be met in order to pay dividends and wynn macau is presently able to pay dividends in accordance with the wynn macau credit facilities.
wynn las vegas, llc intends to fund its operations and capital requirements from cash on hand and operating cash flow. we cannot assure you however, that our las vegas operations will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or the availability of additional indebtedness will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay wynn las vegas, llc's indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. similarly, we expect that our macau operations will fund wynn macau, limited's debt service obligations with existing cash, operating cash flow and availability under the wynn macau credit facilities. however, we cannot assure you that operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so. we may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.
57
legal proceedings in which we are involved also may impact our liquidity. no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of such proceedings. in addition, litigation inherently involves significant costs. for information regarding legal proceedings, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 17 "commitments and contingencies".
we have in the past repurchased, and in the future, we may periodically consider repurchasing our outstanding notes for cash. the amount of any notes to be repurchased, as well as the timing of any repurchases, will be based on business, market and other conditions and factors, including price, contractual requirements or consents, and capital availability. any repurchases might be made using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or by any combination of those methods, in compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations.
our board of directors has authorized an equity repurchase program of up to $1.7 billion. the repurchase program may include repurchases from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the exchange act. as of december 31, 2014, we had purchased a cumulative total of 12,804,954 shares of our common stock for a net cost of $1.1 billion under the program, with no purchases made under this program during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
new business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. we continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in domestic and international markets. there can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. any new development would require us to obtain additional financing. we may decide to conduct any such development through wynn resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the las vegas or macau-related entities.
the company's articles of incorporation provide that, to the extent required by the gaming authority making the determination of unsuitability or to the extent the board of directors determines, in its sole discretion, that a person is likely to jeopardize the company's or any affiliate's application for, receipt of, approval for, right to the use of, or entitlement to, any gaming license, shares of wynn resorts' capital stock that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates are subject to redemption by the company. the redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and would increase our leverage ratio.
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any derivatives except for previously discussed interest rate swaps. we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. at december 31, 2014, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $8.9 million.

(1)   amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon amounts outstanding and libor or hibor rates at december 31, 2014. such rates continue at historical lows as of december 31, 2014. actual rates will vary.
58
(2)   other includes open purchase orders, future charitable contributions, fixed gaming tax payments in macau, aircraft purchase obligations and other contracts. as further discussed in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 16 "income taxes", of this report, we had $88.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2014. due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year and therefore it is not included in the table above as of december 31, 2014.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. a summary of our significant accounting policies are presented in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies". certain of our accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, asset impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty programs, contingencies, litigation and other items. judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. however, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.
development, construction and property and equipment estimates during the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred. in connection with the construction and development of our resorts, significant start-up costs are incurred and charged to pre-opening costs through their respective openings. once our resorts open, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts are no longer charged as pre-opening costs.
during the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of our resorts, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs is recognized when the related assets are placed in service. upon the opening of our resorts, we began recognizing depreciation expense on the resort's fixed assets. the remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed.
our leasehold interest in land in macau under the land concession contracts entered into in august 2004 and may 2012 are being amortized over 25 years, to the initial term of the concession contract, which currently terminate in august 2029 and may 2037. depreciation on a majority of the assets comprising wynn macau commenced in september of 2006, when wynn macau opened. the maximum useful life of assets at wynn macau is deemed to be the remaining life of the land concession which currently expires in august 2029, or the gaming concession which currently expires in june 2022. consequently, depreciation related to wynn macau will generally be charged over shorter periods when compared to wynn las vegas.
costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. the cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in property charges and other.
we also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards. for assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. for assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. in reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. if an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. all recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.
redemption price promissory note in connection with the redemption of the shares previously held by aruze, we recorded the fair value of the redemption note of approximately $1.94 billion in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. we utilized an independent third party valuation to assist in the determination of this fair value. in determining this fair value, we estimated the redemption note's
59
present value using discounted cash flows with a probability weighted expected return for redemption assumptions and a discount rate which included time value and non-performance risk adjustments commensurate with risk of the redemption note.
considerations for the redemption assumptions included the stated maturity of the redemption note, uncertainty of the related cash flows as well as potential effects of the following: uncertainties surrounding the potential outcome and timing of pending litigation with the okada parties (see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 17 "commitments and contingencies"); the outcome of on-going investigations of aruze by the united states attorney's office, the u.s. department of justice and the nevada gaming control board; and other potential legal and regulatory actions. in addition, in the furtherance of various future business objectives, we considered our ability, at our sole option, to prepay the redemption note at any time in accordance with its terms without penalty. accordingly, we reasonably determined that the estimated life of the redemption note could be less than the contractual life of the redemption note.
in determination of the appropriate discount rate to be used in the estimated present value, the redemption note's subordinated position relative to all other debt in our capital structure and credit ratings associated with our traded debt were considered. observable inputs for the risk free rate based on federal reserve rates for u.s. treasury securities and credit risk spread based on a yield curve index of similarly rated debt were used. as a result of this analysis, we concluded the redemption notes' stated rate of 2% approximated a market rate.
investments and fair value we have made investments in domestic and foreign corporate debt securities and commercial paper. our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. we determine the appropriate classification (held-to-maturity/available-for-sale) of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. our investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income (loss). adjustments are made for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method. such amortization is included in interest income together with realized gains and losses and the stated interest on such securities.
we measure certain of our financial assets and liabilities, such as cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities and interest rate swaps, at fair value on a recurring basis pursuant to accounting standards for fair value measurements. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. these accounting standards establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. these tiers include: level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
we obtain pricing information in determining the fair value of our available-for-sale securities from independent pricing vendors. based on our inquiries, the pricing vendors use various pricing models consistent with what other market participants would use. the assumptions and inputs used by the pricing vendors are derived from market observable sources including: reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark curves, bids, offers and other market-related data. we have not made adjustments to such prices. each quarter, we validate the fair value pricing methodology to determine the fair value consistent with applicable accounting guidance and to confirm that the securities are classified properly in the fair value hierarchy. we also compare the pricing received from our vendors to independent sources for the same or similar securities.
allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable a substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume at our las vegas operations. while offered, the issuance of credit at our macau operations is less significant when compared to las vegas. our goal is to maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion. these collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. markers issued at our las vegas operations are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states, and united states assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the united states.
the enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the united states varies from country to country. some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement
60
burdensome. we closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the united states. in addition to our internal credit and collection departments, located in both las vegas and macau, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 85% and 86% of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily in asia. in addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers' home countries.
we regularly evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as management's prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions. in determining our allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable, we apply loss factors based on historical marker collection history to aged account balances and we specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information.
the following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (in thousands):
december 31,
2014                                                                                                  2013
casino accounts receivable                                              $257,930              $252,998
allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable                        $74,149               $73,561
allowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable                     28.7   %              29.1   %
percentage of casino accounts receivable outstanding over 180 days          32.5   %              30.3   %
our reserve for doubtful casino accounts receivable is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the risk assessments and judgments by management regarding realizability, the state of the economy and our credit policy. in june 2014, the company recorded an adjustment to its reserve estimates for casino accounts receivable based on the results of historical collection patterns and current collection trends. for the year ended december 31, 2014, this adjustment benefited operating income by $8.7 million and net income attributable to wynn resorts, limited by $6.8 million (or $0.07 per share on a fully diluted basis). for the year ended december 31, 2013, this adjustment benefited operating income by $30.9 million and net income attributable to wynn resorts, limited by $23.3 million (or $0.22 per share on a fully diluted basis). our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at each of our resorts. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 28.2% and 24.8%, respectively, of our outstanding casino account receivable balance originated at our macau operations.
at december 31, 2014, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change the provision for doubtful accounts by approximately $2.6 million.
as our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts expense may fluctuate. because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as we become aware of additional information about a customer or changes occur in a region's economy or legal system.
derivative financial instruments we seek to manage our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with applicable accounting standards. derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income. as of december 31, 2014, changes in our interest rate swap fair values are being recorded in our consolidated statements of income, as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.
we measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps on a recurring basis. we categorize our interest rate swap contracts as level 2 in the hierarchy as described above. the fair value approximates the amount we would receive (pay) if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. we adjust this amount by applying a non-performance valuation, considering our creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of our counterparties at each settlement date, as applicable.
61
stock-based compensation accounting standards for stock-based payments establish standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. it requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. we use the black-scholes option pricing model to determine grant-date fair value of our stock options. the black-scholes model uses assumptions of expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, the expected term of options granted, and expected rates of dividends. management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to our company.
the expected volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly impact the fair value of stock options. we believe that the valuation techniques and the approach utilized to develop our assumptions are reasonable in calculating the fair value of the options we grant. we estimate the expected stock price volatility using a combination of implied and historical factors related to our stock price in accordance with applicable accounting standards. as our stock price fluctuates, this estimate will change. a hypothetical 10% change in the volatility assumption for the 25,800 options granted in 2014 would not have a material effect on the change in fair value. expected term represents the estimated average time between the option's grant date and its exercise date. a hypothetical 10% change in the expected term assumption for the 25,800 options granted in 2014 would not have a material effect on the change in fair value. these assumed changes in fair value would have been recognized over the vesting schedule of such awards.
accounting standards also require the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and therefore impacts our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre-opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and administrative expenses (including corporate expenses).
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. accounting standards require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.
as of december 31, 2014, we have a foreign tax credit carryover of $3,284 million and we have recorded a valuation allowance of $3,242 million against this asset based on our estimate of future realization. the foreign tax credits are attributable to the macau special gaming tax which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in macau. the u.s. taxing regime only allows a credit for 35% of "net" foreign source income. due to our recent operating history of u.s. losses, we currently do not rely on forecasted taxable income in order to support the utilization of the foreign tax credits. we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax asset for foreign tax credits ("ftcs") and the appropriateness for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. we consider factors such as: our three year cumulative pre-tax book income, the reversal of taxable timing differences, expectations regarding the occurrence of u.s. source income versus foreign source income within the ftcs carryforward period and tax planning strategies. historically, we have recorded a partial valuation allowance on ftcs. based on the expectations for these factors in the next year, we may determine that the deferred tax asset is not recoverable and an additional valuation allowance is necessary. this determination would have a significant impact on the effective tax rate.
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate. we assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes. the accounting standards prescribe a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
uncertain tax position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes. these accounting standards utilize a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.
62
as applicable, we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
recently issued accounting standards see related disclosure at item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies."

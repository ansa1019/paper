overview we are a full service, early-stage contract research organization (cro). for nearly 70 years, we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs, devices, and therapies. over this time, we have built upon our original core competency laboratory animal medicine and science (research model technologies) to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services, both good laboratory practice (glp) and non-glp, that are able to support our clients from target identification through preclinical development. we also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients' manufacturing activities. utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model, which reduces their costs, enhances their productivity and effectiveness, and increases speed to market.
our client base includes primarily of all of the major global pharmaceutical companies, many biotechnology companies, contract research organizations, agricultural and chemical companies, life science companies, veterinary medicine companies, contract manufacturing organizations, medical device companies, diagnostic and other commercial entities, as well as leading hospitals, academic institutions and government agencies around the world. we currently operate approximately 60 facilities in 17 countries worldwide, which numbers exclude our insourcing solutions (is) sites.
business trends the demand for our outsourced services increased in the fiscal year 2014, as did demand for products and services to support our clients' manufacturing activities. our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients continued to intensify their use of strategic outsourcing to improve their operating efficiency and access capabilities that they do not maintain internally. many of our large biopharmaceutical clients are beginning to refocus on their drug discovery and early-stage development efforts after, a period of stronger emphasis on delivering late-stage programs to bring new drugs to market. in addition, mid-tier biopharmaceutical clients benefited from a resurgence in the biotechnology funding environment in the fiscal year 2014, from both capital markets and partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies. academia has also benefited from partnering activities, as large biopharmaceutical companies have increasingly utilized academic research capabilities to broaden the scope of their research activities.
the primary result of these trends was improved demand for our discovery and safety assessment services in the fiscal year 2014, particularly from mid-tier clients. this improvement led to capacity continuing to fill in our safety assessment business, in which utilization is beginning to approach optimal levels. our targeted sales efforts also generated continued market shares gains. price remained competitive, but trends are stable to slightly improving. we believe our scientific expertise, quality, and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make the decision to outsource to us. in order to accommodate this increased demand and maintain responsiveness to clients' needs, we opened small amounts of new capacity in the fiscal year 2014 at existing facilities and continue to strategically evaluate further capacity additions.
our clients' intensified focus on the earliest stages of their pipelines has been visible in increasing demand for discovery services, and the willingness to outsource new areas of their research programs. to address these emerging needs and move further upstream in the drug research and development continuum, we acquired the early discovery businesses of argenta, biofocus, chantest, and vivopath in the fiscal year 2014, which has enabled us to work with clients at the earliest stage of the discovery process. our full service, early-stage portfolio has led to additional client discussions regarding strategic relationships in the fiscal year 2014, where clients seek to outsource larger portions of their early-stage drug research programs to us.
while demand for research models and certain services remained constrained in the fiscal year 2014 as clients' continued to consolidate infrastructure and seek greater pipeline productivity, we remain confident that the long-term drivers of our business as a whole will primarily emerge from our clients' demand for discovery and safety assessment services and research models and services, which remain essential to the early-stage drug research process, as well as our products and services that support our clients' manufacturing activities, including endotoxin and microbial detection.

acquisitions during the fiscal year 2014, we continued to make a number of strategic acquisitions designed to expand our portfolio of services to support the drug discovery and early-stage development continuum and position us as a market leader in the outsourced discovery services market. the 2014 acquisitions include:
•   in april 2014, we acquired 100% of the shares of the united kingdom (u.k.)-based entities argenta and biofocus, and certain related dutch assets, to form the core of our early discovery business. through this transaction, we enhanced our position as a full service, early-stage cro, with integrated in vitro and in vivo capabilities from target discovery through preclinical development. the preliminary purchase price of the acquisition was $183.1 million, net of cash acquired, and included contingent consideration.
•   in june 2014, we acquired substantially all of the assets of vivopath llc (vivopath), a discovery service company. the preliminary purchase price was $2.3 million, including contingent consideration that could become payable over the next three years based on the achievement of revenue growth targets.
•   in october 2014, we acquired chantest corporation (chantest), a leading provider of ion channel testing services to the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. the preliminary purchase price was $52.1 million, net of cash acquired, and included contingent consideration.
segment reporting in the second quarter of 2014, following our acquisition of argenta and biofocus, we revised our reportable segments to ensure alignment with our view of the business. we reviewed the new and existing markets addressed by the business, the recently revised go-to-market strategy, long-term operating margins, and the discrete financial information available to our chief operating decision maker, and considered how our businesses aggregated based on these qualitative and quantitative factors. based on this review, we identified three reportable segments: research models and services (rms), discovery and safety assessment (dsa), and manufacturing support (manufacturing). we reported segment results on this basis for the current period and retrospectively for all comparable prior periods.
the revised reportable segments are as follows:
research models and services   discovery and safety assessment   manufacturing support research models                discovery services (2)            endotoxin and microbial detection research model services (1)    safety assessment                 avian vaccine services biologics testing solutions
(1) research model services includes genetically engineered models and services (gems), research animal diagnostic services (rads), and is.
(2) discovery services includes both the early discovery and in vivo discovery businesses. early discovery includes argenta, biofocus, and chantest.
our rms segment includes the research models and research model services businesses. research models includes the commercial production and sale of small research models, as well as the supply of large research models. research model services includes three business units: gems, which performs contract breeding and other services associated with genetically engineered research models; rads, which provides health monitoring and diagnostics services related to research models; and is, which provides management of our clients' research operations (including recruitment, training, staffing and management services). our dsa segment includes services required to take a drug through the early development process including discovery services, which are non-regulated services to assist clients with the identification, screening, and selection of a lead compound for drug development, and regulated and non-regulated safety assessment services. our manufacturing segment includes endotoxin and microbial detection (emd), which includes in vitro (non-animal) lot-release testing products and microbial detection and species identification services; biologics testing services (biologics), which performs specialized testing of biologics and devices; and avian vaccine services (avian), which supplies specific-pathogen-free fertile chicken eggs and chickens.
prior to recasting the reportable segments, the businesses were reported in two segments as follows:
research models and services        preclinical services research models (3)                 discovery services research model services (4)         safety assessment endotoxin and microbial detection   biologics testing solutions
29
(3) research models included avian vaccine services.
(4) research model services included gems, rads, is and discovery research services. as part of the segment revisions, the former discovery research services was been folded into our discovery services business, previously located under the preclinical services segment.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (u.s.). the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures. these estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. we base our estimates on our historical experience, trends in the industry, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1, "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies", to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been provided, our price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
service revenue is generally evidenced by client contracts, which range in duration from a few weeks to a few years and typically take the form of an agreed upon rate per unit or fixed fee arrangements. such contracts typically do not contain acceptance provisions based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results. revenue of agreed upon rate per unit contracts is recognized as services are performed, based upon rates specified in the contract. in cases where performance spans reporting periods, revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed, measured on the ratio of outputs or performance obligations completed to the total contractual outputs or performance obligations to be provided. changes in estimated effort to complete the fixed fee contract are reflected in the period in which the change becomes known. changes in scope of work are common, especially under long-term contracts, and generally result in a change in contract value. once the parties have agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms, the contract value is amended and revenue is typically recognized as described above.
most contracts are terminable by the client, either immediately or upon notice. these contracts often require payment to us of expenses to wind down the project, fees earned to date or, in some cases, a termination fee. such payments are included in revenues when earned.
we recognize product revenue, net of allowances for estimated returns, rebates and discounts, when title and risk of loss pass to customers. when we sell equipment with specified acceptance criteria, we assess our ability to meet the acceptance criteria in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition. we would defer revenue until completion of customer acceptance testing if we are not able to demonstrate the ability to meet such acceptance criteria.
income taxes we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction's tax laws and regulations. in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. in performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. in making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and the effects of tax planning strategies. our estimates of future taxable income include,
30
among other items, our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options. in the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
we account for uncertain tax positions using a "more-likely-than-not" threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors, that include, but are not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the "more-likely-than-not" threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process. we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews; we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position; and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would re-examine the related tax position. we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
as of december 27, 2014, our non-u.s. subsidiaries' undistributed foreign earnings included in consolidated retained earnings aggregated $271.0 million. all undistributed foreign earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries, exclusive of earnings that would result in little or no net income tax expense or which were previously taxed under current u.s. tax law, are reinvested indefinitely in operations outside the u.s. this determination is made on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis and takes into account the liquidity requirements in both the u.s. and within our foreign subsidiaries. if we decide to repatriate funds in the future to execute our growth initiatives or to fund any other liquidity needs, the resulting tax consequences would negatively impact our results of operations through a higher effective tax rate and dilution of our earnings.
goodwill and intangible assets we use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. the determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques, such as the income approach and the cost approach, as appropriate, in establishing the fair value of intangible assets. typically, key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets.
we review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.
we evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. if we elect this option and believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable, the quantitative two-step impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. alternatively, we may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative two-step impairment test. in the first step, we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. if the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units, then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill. if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
31
in the fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, we performed the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test for our reporting units. fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a market-based approach and an income approach, as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. under the market-based approach, we utilized information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units. under the income approach, we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
our 2014, 2013 and 2012 impairment test indicated that goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired.
in 2014, we revised our reportable segments to align with our new view of the business following the argenta and biofocus acquisition. as a result of this reorganization, goodwill was allocated from our prior reportable segments to our new reportable segments based on the fair value of each business group within its original reporting unit relative to the fair value of that reporting unit. in addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed.
valuation and impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets to be held and used, including property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:
•   significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;
•   significant negative industry or economic trends; or
•   significant changes or developments in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our long-lived assets.
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset, net of any sublease income, if applicable, and its eventual disposition. in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their fair values. we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows, including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets, as appropriate. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets. during the fiscal year 2014, we did not record any significant impairment charges to long-lived assets.
pension and other retiree benefit plans several of our u.s. and non-u.s. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. this amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. we measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end.
the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the expected return on plan assets, discount rate, and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance.
the discount rate reflects the rate we would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle our current pension obligations. in the fiscal year 2014, as part of our annual review of assumptions for our u.s. pension and retiree benefit plans, we selected the discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using towers watson's proprietary bond:link tool.  prior to the fiscal year 2014, we employed a cash-flow matching methodology, which
32
used the spot yield curve underlying the citigroup index. the refined estimation technique permits us to more closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants than would be possible with the previously used yield curve model. we believe such a refinement results in an estimate of the discount rate that more accurately reflects the settlement value for plan obligations than the yield curve methodology used in prior years, as it provides the ability to review the quality and diversification of the portfolio to select the bond issues that would settle the obligation in an optimal manner. this refinement reduced our benefit obligations as of december 27, 2014 by $5.5 million.
the rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy.
in the fiscal year 2014, for our u.s. plans, we adopted new mortality tables (rp-2014) and a new mortality improvement scale (mp-2014), which increased our benefit obligations by $6.0 million as of december 27, 2014. we previously used the rp-2000 mortality tables with mortality improvements projected using scale aa to 2021 for annuitants and to 2029 for non-annuitants. in addition, for our u.k. plans, the mortality table was updated to s2 series (saps) using the cmi 2013 core projection with a 1.25% per annum long-term mortality improvement. this update increased our benefit obligations by $1.9 million as of december 27, 2014. prior to the fiscal year 2014, we used the s1 series (saps) mortality table and the cmi 2009 core projection with a 1.25% per annum long-term improvement. the new mortality information reflects improved life expectancies and an expectation that the trend will continue.
stock-based compensation we grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance share units (psus) to employees, and stock options and restricted stock to non-employee directors under stock-based compensation plans. we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our stock-based compensation arrangements. changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the timing and amount of expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.
determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment. the fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the black-scholes model and the fair value of psus is calculated using a lattice model with a monte carlo simulation, both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term, among others.
determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of psu's performance targets requires judgment, including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets. the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets. the cumulative impact of any changes to our estimates is reflected in the period of change.
we also estimate forfeitures over the requisite service period when recognizing share-based compensation expense based on historical rates and forward looking factors; these estimates are adjusted to the extent that actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to materially differ, from our estimates.

the increase in rms sg&a of $6.2 million was related to an increase of $2.5 million in compensation, benefits and other employee related expenses; the recording of $1.6 million in charges related to an arbitration award in favor of a large model supplier; an increase of $0.5 million in severance due to consolidation plans in the u.s. and japan; and an increase of $2.6 million in other expenses; partially offset by a decrease of $1.0 million due to a gain on the sale of facility impacted by a consolidation plan. rms sg&a as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 was 13.0%, an increase of 1.3%, from 11.7% for the fiscal year 2013.
the increase in dsa sg&a of $13.4 million was related to an increase of $5.5 million in compensation, benefits and other employee related expenses; an increase of $1.9 million in severance; an increase of $1.2 million in operating expenses including information technology infrastructure and facility expenses; an increase of $0.8 million in stock-based compensation, primarily related to our new hire grants and our annual stock-based grants made in february 2014; and an increase of $4.0 million in other expenses; all of which were primarily due to the argenta and biofocus acquisition. dsa sg&a as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 was 11.7%, an increase of 0.2%, from 11.5% for the fiscal year 2013.
the increase in manufacturing sg&a of $5.6 million was related to an increase of $3.8 million in compensation, benefits and other employee related expenses; an increase of $1.8 million in operating expenses including information technology infrastructure and facility expenses; and an increase of $0.5 million in stock-based compensation, primarily related to our new hire grants and our annual stock-based grants made in february 2014; partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in other expenses. manufacturing sg&a as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 was 18.9%, consistent with the fiscal year 2013.
the increase in unallocated corporate sg&a of $18.1 million was related to an increase of $7.4 million in compensation, benefits and other employee related expenses; an increase of $5.1 million of stock-based compensation, primarily related to our new hire grants, our annual stock-based grants made in february 2014 and increased expense recognized for performance stock units whose payout is based upon our financial performance; an increase of $4.8 million in external consulting and other service expenses; an increase of $4.5 million of costs associated with the evaluation and integration of acquisitions; and an increase of $1.4 million in other expenses; partially offset by a reduction of $5.1 million in information technology related expenses.
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangibles for the fiscal year 2014 was $26.0 million, an increase of $8.2 million, or 46.1%, from $17.8 million for the fiscal year 2013, primarily as a result of the argenta and biofocus acquisition.

interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year 2014 was $12.0 million, a decrease of $9.0 million, or 42.9%, compared to $21.0 million for the fiscal year 2013. the decrease was primarily the result of the retirement late in the second quarter of the fiscal year 2013 of our senior convertible debentures, which lowered our effective interest rate.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net was $10.7 million for the fiscal year 2014, an increase of $3.5 million, or 48.6%, compared to $7.2 million for the fiscal year 2013. the increase in other income (expense), net was driven by our investments in limited partnerships accounted for under the equity method, which increased $3.4 million, and a non-cash

gain of $2.1 million related to assets assumed at our frederick, maryland facility following the termination of a customer contract, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange and other activity of $2.0 million.
income taxes income tax expense in the fiscal year 2014 increased $14.8 million, compared with the fiscal year 2013. our effective tax rate was 26.8% in the fiscal year 2014, compared to 23.8% in the fiscal year 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to current-year tax law changes, including a statutory 25% decrease in the canadian scientific research and experimental development (sr&ed) credit and an increase in the limitation of deductibility of interest expense in france. in addition, the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2014 reflected a discrete tax cost of $1.6 million related to the nondeductible transaction costs incurred in the fiscal year 2014 for the acquisition of the early discovery businesses and a discrete tax cost of $1.2 million related to the write-off of deferred tax assets as a result of the reorganization of the company's rms u.k. entities. these increases were partially offset by a $2.1 million release of an uncertain tax position resulting from an ability to offset tax on a capital gain from an investment in a limited partnership. the fiscal year 2013 effective tax rate includes a discrete tax detriment of $2.0 million related to the ongoing transfer pricing controversy with the canadian revenue authority (cra).

(1)   notes payable includes the principal payments on our debt.
(2)   we lease properties and equipment for use in our operations. in addition to rent, the leases may require us to pay additional amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses. amounts reflected within the table, detail future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable operating leases for each of the periods presented.
(3)   in the fiscal year 2014, we acquired a build-to-suit lease as part of our acquisition of argenta and biofocus. in accordance with accounting guidance applicable to entities involved with the construction of an asset that will be leased when the construction is completed, we are considered the owner of this property during the construction period. accordingly, we recorded an asset and a corresponding financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet for the amount of costs incurred related to the construction for this building. the construction is expected to be completed in the first half of the fiscal year 2015. upon completion of the building, we will assess and determine if the assets and corresponding liability should be derecognized. as of december 27, 2014, the amount recorded within our consolidated balance sheet as property, plant and equipment and financing obligation totaled $23.1 million. the amounts in the above table represent future minimum rental commitments.
(4)   we maintain defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans as discussed in note 10, "employee benefit plans" included in this report. in the above table we have included the discounted estimated benefit payments we

expect to make to fund our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. we note that actual payments to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors that may change in future years; such as expected retirement age, rate of compensation increases, medical trend rates, mortality assumptions, etc.  our funding for pension plans is consistent with applicable laws and regulations.
(5)   the estimated cash obligation for redeemable noncontrolling interest, which is exercisable by the non-controlling interest holders in 2016 at fair value, is based on the estimated fair value of the interest as of december 27, 2014.
(6)   the timing of the remaining capital commitment payments to limited partnership investments is subject to the procedures of the general partner and is therefore estimated by management.
(7)   in connection with our purchase of argenta and biofocus, vivopath and chantest, we agreed to make additional payments of up to $10.5 million based upon the achievement of certain financial targets. the contingent consideration obligation included in the table above has not been probability adjusted or discounted.
tax related obligations we excluded liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations presented above as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. as of december 27, 2014, we have $34.6 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements, including "off-balance sheet arrangements" as described in sec regulation s-k item 303. as such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.

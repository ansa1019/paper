our results for q4 2014 were a strong finish to a great year. we achieved record net revenue of $14.7 billion, up 6% from q4 2013. we achieved increased net revenue and unit sales growth in the pccg segment, with net revenue up 3% and operating profit up 18% from q4 2013. dcg achieved 25% net revenue growth and 39% operating income growth from q4 2013. we saw a moderate increase in net inventory levels from q3 2014 as we are efficiently managing capacity while ramping our 5th generation intel core processor family on 14nm, code-named "broadwell." the worldwide pc supply chain appears to be healthy, with inventory levels appropriate as we enter q1 2015.
gross margin improved by approximately three and a half percentage points from q4 2013. the increase from q4 2013 was primarily due to lower factory start-up costs, lower pccg and dcg platform (platform) unit costs, higher platform average selling prices, and higher platform unit sales. these items were partially offset by the impact of higher cash consideration associated with our tablet platform and higher production costs on our 14nm products treated as period charges.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
for full year 2014, we achieved record net revenue of $55.9 billion, up 6% from 2013, operating income of $15.3 billion, up 25% from 2013, and diluted earnings per share of $2.31, up 22% from 2013. both our pccg and dcg businesses outperformed our expectations for the year. pccg net revenue was up 4%, with pccg platform unit sales up 8% primarily on higher notebook platform unit sales. we saw robust growth in dcg, with net revenue up 18% and platform average selling prices and unit sales up 10% and 8%, respectively. gross margin of approximately 64% was up approximately four points from 2013 driven by lower platform unit costs, lower start-up costs, and higher platform volumes. these increases were partially offset by higher cost of sales associated with higher tablet platform unit sales and cash consideration provided to our customers associated with integrating our tablet platform.
in 2014, we started growing again across a broad range of products and markets by introducing many new product technologies across all of our businesses. we began shipping the world's first processor on 14nm process technology. additionally, we launched a new family of processors, intel core m. intel core m processor is enabling new designs and form factors with its full core performance in both compute and graphics. we recently launched intel realsense technology, which includes software and depth cameras that enable more natural and intuitive interaction with personal computing devices. in the wireless business, we qualified our first soc application processor and baseband 3g solution, code-named "sofia." we also exceeded our goal of 40 million tablet platform unit sales in 2014.
the cash generation from our business remained strong, with cash from operations of $20.4 billion in 2014. we ended the year with an investment portfolio of $14.1 billion, down approximately $6.0 billion from a year ago. our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. we purchased $10.1 billion in capital assets, down from our prior outlook of $11.0 billion as we found efficiencies, optimized our manufacturing network, and increased our factory utilization. in addition, we returned $4.4 billion to stockholders through dividends and repurchased $10.8 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. our board of directors authorized an increase of $20 billion to the common stock repurchase program. effective in q1 2015, our annual dividend increased to $0.96 per share and our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock.
looking ahead to 2015, we are forecasting revenue to grow in the mid-single digits and the midpoint of our gross margin range to be at 62% plus or minus a couple of points. additionally, we are forecasting r&d and mg&a spending to be approximately $20.0 billion plus or minus $400 million and forecasting capital spending of $10.0 billion plus or minus $500 million. for q1 2015, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range to be $13.7 billion plus or minus $500 million, down approximately 7% from q4 2014. this forecast is in line with the average seasonal decline for the first quarter. we are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be 60% plus or minus a couple of points.
our business outlook for q1 2015 and full year 2015 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (r&d plus mg&a), and capital expenditures. we publish our business outlook in our quarterly earnings release.
our business outlook and any updates thereto are publicly available on our investor relations website, www.intc.com. this business outlook is not incorporated by reference in this form 10-k. we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the business outlook or in this form 10-k. the statements in the business outlook and forward-looking statements in this form 10-k are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times. the forward-looking statements in the business outlook will be effective through the close of business on march 13, 2015, unless updated earlier. from the close of business on march 13, 2015, until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for april 14, 2015, we will observe a "quiet period." during the quiet period, the business outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k filed on january 15, 2015, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the company's news releases and filings with the sec, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10-k, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. during the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations. the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
critical accounting estimates the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. our most critical accounting estimates include:
•   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity investments, net when we record impairments;
•   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles), which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization;
•   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes;
•   the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and
•   the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment.
in the following section, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved.
non-marketable equity investments we regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $3.2 billion as of december 27, 2014 ($2.3 billion as of december 28, 2013).
our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success depends on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors. the companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. these events could cause our investments to become impaired. in addition, financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. for further information about our investment portfolio risks, see "risk factors" in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k.
we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized. the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment. qualitative analysis of our investments involves understanding our investee's revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects, the technological feasibility of our investee's products and technologies, the general market conditions in the investee's industry or geographic area including adverse regulatory or economic changes, and the management and governance structure of the investee. quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments are developed using the market and income approaches. the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as revenue, earnings, comparable performance multiples, recent financing rounds, the terms of the investees' issued interests, and the level of marketability of the investments. the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies' sizes, growth rates, industries, and development stages. the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding the investees' revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data.
if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. if the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment. impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $140 million in 2014 ($112 million in 2013 and $104 million in 2012).

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
long-lived assets property, plant and equipment we assess property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. we measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. if an asset grouping's carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. we measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset grouping's carrying value and its fair value. property, plant and equipment is considered a non-financial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized.
impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. in addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets' new, shorter useful lives. based on our analysis, impairments and accelerated depreciation of our property, plant and equipment was $115 million in 2014 ($172 million in 2013 and $73 million in 2012).
goodwill goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition. reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in "note 26: operating segments and geographic information" in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.
we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. additionally, as part of this assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value. for reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform additional analysis. if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. if we determine during the second step that the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
34
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income method and the market method to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. the income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following assumptions and inputs: revenue, based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. our estimates of market segment growth, our market segment share, and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and a variety of external sources. these estimates are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process. the same estimates are also used in planning for our long-term manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process, and for long-term and short-term business planning and forecasting. we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data. the market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. a reporting unit's carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt.
for the annual impairment assessment in 2014, we determined that for each of our reporting units, it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value. as a result, we concluded that performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for any reporting unit. during the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years, we have completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years.
identified intangibles we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. if we determine that an individual asset is impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset.
the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. they can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. based on our impairment assessment, we recognized impairment charges of $36 million in 2014 ($17 million in 2013 and $21 million in 2012).
income taxes we must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery is not more likely than not, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. however, should a change occur in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery is not more likely than not. recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management's plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in management's plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes.
35
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
we have not recognized u.s. deferred income taxes on certain undistributed non-u.s. earnings because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the u.s. remittances of non-u.s. earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-u.s. and u.s. operations. material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in the various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-u.s. earnings, which would be subject to u.s. income taxes and applicable non-u.s. income and withholding taxes.
inventory intel has a product development lifecycle that corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. these engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities, and associated costs, change in nature from r&d to cost of sales. in order for a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. this milestone is known as product release qualification (prq). we have identified prq as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory.
to determine which costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity. if the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; therefore, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. excess capacity charges were zero in 2014 ($319 million in 2013 and $540 million in 2012).
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, customer acceptance of our products, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. if the estimated market value of the inventory is less than the carrying value, we write down the inventory and record the difference as a charge to cost of sales. inventory reserves increased by approximately $290 million in 2014 compared to 2013. this increase was driven primarily by higher production costs on 14nm treated as period charges and pre-qualification product costs. these increases were partially offset by the sell-through of written-down inventory and previously non-qualified units.
the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. the demand forecast is utilized in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. the estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
loss contingencies we are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings and asserted and potential claims, accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business. an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred. the outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. at least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our estimates. these revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

we recorded the additional accruals and adjustments as restructuring and asset impairment charges in the consolidated statements of income and within the "all other" operating segments category. a majority of the accrued restructuring balance as of december 27, 2014 is expected to be paid within the next 12 months and was recorded as a current liability within accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated balance sheets.
restructuring actions that were approved in 2014 impacted approximately 3,700 employees. since q3 2013, we have incurred a total of $535 million in restructuring and asset impairment charges. these charges included a total of $466 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 7,600 employees, and $69 million in asset impairment charges and other restructuring charges.
we estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately $600 million, which will be realized within r&d, cost of sales, and mg&a. we began to realize these savings in q4 2013 and expect to fully realize these savings beginning in q2 2015.

we recognized lower net gains on equity investments in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower gains on sales of equity investments partially offset by higher gains on third-party merger transactions. the majority of gains on sales, net for 2014 resulted from gains on private equity sales.
we recognized higher net gains on equity investments in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher gains on sales of equity investments, partially offset by lower gains on third-party merger transactions. net gains on equity investments for 2013 included gains of $439 million on the sales of our interest in clearwire communications, llc (clearwire llc) and our shares in clearwire corporation in q3 2013. for further information on these transactions, see "note 5: cash and investments" in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.
we recognized an interest and other net gain in 2014 compared to a net loss in 2013 due to a gain recognized on the divestiture of our intel media assets in 2014. for further information, see "note 9: divestitures" in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.
we recognized an interest and other net loss in 2013 compared to a net gain in 2012. we recognized a net loss in 2013 due to an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of our $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in q4 2012. additionally, in q2 2012 we received proceeds from an insurance claim related to the floods in thailand.
provision for taxes our provision for taxes and effective tax rate for each period were as follows:

effective tax rate               25.9   %            23.7   %            26.0   %
the u.s. r&d tax credit was reenacted in q4 2014 retroactive for the full year. it was also reenacted in q1 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012. a substantial majority of the increase in our effective tax rate between 2014 and 2013 was driven by the reenacted u.s. r&d tax credit in 2013 containing two years' worth of r&d tax credits.
the majority of the decrease in our effective tax rate between 2013 and 2012 was driven by the recognition of the 2012 u.s. r&d tax credit in q1 2013. this was partially offset by a lower percentage of our profits generated in lower tax jurisdictions in 2013 compared to 2012.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
operating activities cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.
for 2014 compared to 2013, the $358 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher net income and adjustments for non-cash items. the adjustments for non-cash items were higher due primarily to higher depreciation in 2014 compared to 2013. income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2014 compared to 2013 were $1.8 billion higher due to higher income before taxes in 2014 and 2012 income tax overpayments, which reduced income taxes paid in 2013.
changes in assets and liabilities as of december 27, 2014, compared to december 28, 2013, included an income taxes net receivable resulting from income tax settlement payments in 2014 and higher accounts receivable resulting from a higher portion of sales at the end of q4 2014.
for 2014, our three largest customers accounted for 46% of our net revenue (44% in 2013 and 43% in 2012), with hp accounting for 18% of our net revenue (17% in 2013 and 18% in 2012), dell accounting for 16% of our net revenue (15% in 2013 and 14% in 2012), and lenovo accounting for 12% of our net revenue (12% in 2013 and 11% in 2012). these three customers accounted for 43% of our accounts receivable as of december 27, 2014 (34% as of december 28, 2013).
for 2013 compared to 2012, the $1.9 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital, partially offset by lower net income in 2013.
investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; as well as proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions.
the decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets,higher maturities, and sales of our available-for-sale investments. this activity was partially offset by an increase in investments in non-marketable equity investments and lower maturities and sales of trading assets. our capital expenditures were $10.1 billion in 2014 ($10.7 billion in 2013 and $11.0 billion in 2012).
cash used for investing activities increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in purchases of available-for-sale investments and a decrease in maturities and sales of trading assets, partially offset by an increase in maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments and a decrease in purchases of licensed technology and patents. net purchases of available-for-sale investments in 2012 included our purchase of $3.2 billion of equity securities in asml in q3 2012.
financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.
the increase in cash used for financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program partially offset by the issuance of short-term debt in 2014. we have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our board of directors in 2005, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to $65 billion in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions. this amount includes an increase of $20 billion in the authorization limit approved by our board of directors in july 2014. during 2014, we repurchased $10.8 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program compared to $2.1 billion in 2013. as of december 27, 2014, $12.4 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. we base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans totaled $1.7 billion in 2014 compared to $1.6 billion in 2013. our total dividend payments were $4.4 billion in 2014 compared to $4.5 billion in 2013. we have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 89 quarters. in january 2015, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock for q1 2015. the dividend is payable on march 1, 2015 to stockholders of record on february 7, 2015.
45
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the increase in cash used for financing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2012 and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program in 2013.
liquidity cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. as of december 27, 2014, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets totaled $14.1 billion ($20.1 billion as of december 28, 2013). in addition to the $14.1 billion, we have $2.0 billion of other long-term investments, $1.3 billion of loans receivable and other, and $450 million of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. most of our investments in debt instruments are in a/a2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated aa-/aa3 or better.
another potential source of liquidity is an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion. this ongoing authorization includes borrowings under our commercial paper program. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program were $2.4 billion during 2014, and $500 million of commercial paper remained outstanding as of december 27, 2014. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor's and p-1 by moody's as of december 27, 2014. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. in 2012, we utilized this shelf registration statement and issued $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. the proceeds from the sale of these notes were used for general corporate purposes and to repurchase common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock repurchase program. for further information on the terms of the notes, see "note 15: borrowings" in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.
as of december 27, 2014, $12.0 billion of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $12.0 billion held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, approximately $2.3 billion was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of december 27, 2014. the remaining amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no u.s. current or deferred taxes have been accrued and this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the u.s. and future acquisitions of non-u.s. entities. we believe our u.s. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the u.s., and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., such amounts would be subject to u.s. income taxes and applicable non-u.s. income and withholding taxes.
we believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, working capital requirements, dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
fair value of financial instruments when determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor's credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. for further information, see "fair value" in "note 2: accounting policies" and "note 4: fair value" in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.
marketable debt instruments as of december 27, 2014, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $15.0 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $6.9 billion was classified as level 1, $8.0 billion as level 2, and $106 million as level 3.
our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. we evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active.
of the $8.0 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 40% was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model performed by us and approximately 60% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.
our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.
loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements as of december 27, 2014, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $721 million of loans receivable and $268 million of reverse repurchase agreements. all of these investments were classified as level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.
marketable equity securities as of december 27, 2014, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $7.1 billion of marketable equity securities. all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.

1   capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. they were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 27, 2014, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property.
2   other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. funding obligations include agreements to fund various projects with other companies.
3   amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. debt obligations are classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the consolidated balance sheets. any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments.
4   we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $262 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. however, long-term income taxes payable, recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and u.s. tax credits arising from non-u.s. income taxes.
5   amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. expected required contributions to our u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $69 million to be made during 2015 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2015 are not practicable to estimate.
6   total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities.
the expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services, included in other purchase obligations and commitments in the preceding table, include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. for obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.
we have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. in addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table. these obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements, contingent funding or payment obligations, and milestone-based equity investment funding. these arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. as of december 27, 2014, assuming that all future milestones are met, excluding the asml milestones subsequently mentioned, the additional required payments would be approximately $450 million. during 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with asml intended to accelerate the development of euv lithography, certain of which were amended in 2014. under the amended agreements intel agreed to provide r&d funding totaling €829 million over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from asml. our remaining obligation, contingent upon asml achieving certain milestones, is approximately €562 million, or $689 million, as of december 27, 2014. as our obligation is contingent upon asml achieving certain milestones, we have excluded this obligation from the preceding table.
for the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. the obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. in addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.
during 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with tsinghua unigroup ltd. (tsinghua unigroup), an operating subsidiary of tsinghua holdings co. ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop intel architecture- and communications-based solutions for smartphones. subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, we have also agreed to invest up to rmb 9.0 billion (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of the holding company under tsinghua unigroup, which will own spreadtrum communications and rda microelectronics. as our obligation is contingent upon regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, it has been excluded from the preceding table.
off-balance-sheet arrangements as of december 27, 2014, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.

revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to our february 2014 acquisition of celesio ag ("celesio") and february 2013 acquisition of pss world medical, inc. ("pssi"), as well as due to market growth and our mix of business. market growth reflects growing drug utilization, which includes newly launched drugs and price increases. increases in revenues were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions.
gross profit and gross profit margin increased over the last two years primarily due to our business acquisitions, higher buy margin and our mix of business, partially offset by a decrease in sell margin. additionally, gross profit was impacted by higher lifo-related inventory charges which were $337 million, $311 million and $13 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
operating expenses increased over the last two years primarily due to our business acquisitions, including increases in acquisition-related expenses and higher intangible asset amortization, and higher compensation and benefit costs. operating expenses in 2015 also included a pre-tax and after-tax $150 million charge associated with the settlement of controlled substance distribution claims with the drug enforcement administration ("dea"), department of justice ("doj") and various u.s. attorney's offices, and in 2014 and 2013 operating expenses included $68 million and $72 million of charges associated with our average wholesale price ("awp") litigation. additionally, operating expenses for 2013 were favorably impacted by an $81 million non-cash gain on a business combination related to our purchase of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building.

income from continuing operations before income taxes increased over the last two years reflecting higher gross profit, partially offset by higher operating and interest expenses. interest expense increased in 2015 primarily due to our acquisition of celesio. additionally, income from continuing operations in 2013 included a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $191 million associated with the sale of our 49% equity interest in nadro, s.a. de c.v ("nadro"). the impairment reduced the investment's carrying value to its estimated fair value. nadro was sold in 2014 with no material gain or loss on disposition.
our reported income tax rates were 30.7%, 34.9% and 30.1% in 2015, 2014 and 2013. income tax expense for 2014 included a charge of $122 million relating to our litigation with the canadian revenue agency ("cra").
during the fourth quarter of 2015, we committed to a plan to sell our brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business which we acquired through our acquisition of celesio. financial results for this business have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. as a result, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2015 includes $241 million pre-tax ($235 million after-tax) non-cash impairment charges to write-off the business' long-lived assets and reduce the carrying value of this business to its fair value, less costs to sell.
loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2014 included a non-cash pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge of $80 million related to our international technology business, which was sold in part in 2015.
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2015 primarily reflects the $62 million of guaranteed dividends and recurring compensation that mckesson is obligated to pay the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the "domination agreement"), which became effective in december 2014 as further described below.
net income attributable to mckesson corporation was $1,476 million, $1,263 million and $1,338 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. diluted earnings per common share attributable to mckesson corporation from continuing operations were $7.54, $6.08 and $5.69 and diluted loss per common share attributable to mckesson corporation from discontinued operations were $1.27, $0.67 and $0.10 in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
on february 6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 77.6% of the then outstanding common shares of celesio and certain convertible bonds of celesio for cash consideration of $4.5 billion, net of cash acquired (the "acquisition"). upon the acquisition, as required, we consolidated celesio's debt with a fair value of $2.3 billion as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet and our ownership of celesio's fully diluted common shares was 75.6%. we owned approximately 75.4% of celesio's outstanding and fully diluted common shares at march 31, 2014. financial results for celesio are included within our international pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which is part of our distribution solutions segment, since the date of acquisition.
on may 22, 2014, celesio and mckesson, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, mckesson deutschland gmbh & co. kgaa ("mckesson deutschland," formerly known as dragonfly gmbh & co. kgaa), entered into the domination agreement. on july 15, 2014, the domination agreement was approved at the general shareholders' meeting of celesio. on december 2, 2014, the domination agreement became effective upon its registration in the commercial register of celesio at the local court of stuttgart, germany. upon the effectiveness of the domination agreement, the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio no longer participate in their percentage ownership of celesio's profits and losses. instead, mckesson became obligated to pay a one-time $50 million dividend ("guaranteed dividend") for their fiscal year ended december 31, 2014, and an annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per celesio share (effective january 1, 2015) to the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio. the recurring compensation amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period. for fiscal 2016, the estimated annual recurring compensation is $44 million based on the euro to u.s. dollar exchange rate and shares owned by the noncontrolling interests at april 1, 2015.
in addition, upon effectiveness of the domination agreement, the noncontrolling interests in celesio became redeemable as a result of a put right. accordingly, the carrying value of noncontrolling interests related to celesio of $1.5 billion was reclassified in the third quarter of 2015 from "total equity" to "redeemable noncontrolling interests" on our consolidated balance sheet. the balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests will be reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. at march 31, 2015, the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests amounted to $1.4 billion, which exceeded the maximum redemption value of $1.2 billion.

(1)   gross profit for our distribution solutions segment for 2015, 2014 and 2013 includes lifo-related inventory charges of $337 million, $311 million and $13 million.
consolidated gross profit and gross profit margin increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to an increase in our distribution solutions segment.
distribution solutions distribution solutions gross profit margin increased over the last two years primarily reflecting our business acquisitions and higher buy margin within our north american distribution business, partially offset by a decrease in sell margin primarily driven by higher sales volume, and an increase in lifo-related inventory charges. buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers. gross profit margin for 2015 was also unfavorably affected by the increased sales associated with newly launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis c. gross profit margin for 2014 was also favorably affected by growth in sales of higher margin generic drugs.
our lifo-related inventory expense was $337 million in 2015, $311 million in 2014 and $13 million in 2013. our north american distribution business uses the lifo method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. the business' practice is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price-related inventory losses. a lifo expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. our annual lifo expense is affected by expected changes in year-end inventory quantities, product mix and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be influenced by market and other external influences. changes to any of the above factors could have a material impact to our annual lifo expense.
as a result of cumulative net price deflation, at march 31, 2013, pharmaceutical inventories at lifo were $60 million more than market and, accordingly, a $60 million lower-of-cost or market ("lcm") reserve reduced inventories to market. in 2015 and 2014, we experienced net inflation in our pharmaceutical inventories and lifo-related charges were incurred, and in 2014, the $60 million lcm reserve was fully released resulting in an increase in gross profit. as of march 31, 2015 and 2014, pharmaceutical inventories at lifo did not exceed market. additional information regarding our lifo accounting is included under the caption "critical accounting policies and estimates," included in this financial review.

technology solutions technology solutions gross profit margin decreased in 2015 primarily due to a $34 million pre-tax charge representing a catch-up in depreciation and amortization expense not recognized in 2014 when certain assets were classified as held-for-sale and our mix of business. these decreases were partially offset by the planned elimination of a product line and lower product alignment charges. gross profit margin increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to growth in higher margin revenues, partially offset by higher product alignment charges.
in 2014, we committed to a plan to sell our international technology and hospital automation businesses from our technology solutions segment. as required, we classified the results of operations and cash flows of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements in 2014 and depreciation and amortization expense was not recognized as the assets were held-for-sale.  during the first quarter of 2015, we decided to retain the workforce business within our international technology business. as a result, we reclassified the workforce business, which had been designated as a discontinued operation during 2014, as a continuing operation for all periods presented. additionally, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $34 million as a catch-up of depreciation and amortization expense not recognized in 2014 when the assets were classified as held-for-sale.
in 2014, the segment recorded pre-tax charges totaling $57 million.  these charges primarily consisted of $35 million of product alignment charges, $15 million of integration-related expenses and $7 million of reduction-in-workforce severance charges.  included in the total charge was $35 million for severance for employees primarily in our research and development, customer services and sales functions, and $15 million for asset impairments which primarily represents the write-off of deferred costs for a product that will no longer be developed.  charges were recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as follows: $34 million in cost of sales and $23 million in operating expenses.
in 2013, this segment recorded $46 million of non-cash pre-tax impairment charges. these charges were the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product. the charge included a $36 million goodwill impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill within the applicable reporting unit to its implied fair value. in addition, the goodwill had a nominal tax basis. this impairment charge was recorded in operating expenses within our consolidated statement of operations. the balance of the charge represents a $10 million impairment to reduce the carrying value of the unamortized capitalized software held for sale costs for this product to its net realizable value. we concluded that the estimated future undiscounted revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value. this impairment charge was recorded in cost of sales within our consolidated statement of operations.

segment operating profit:
distribution solutions: operating profit increased over the last two years primarily reflecting growth in our business and our business acquisitions. operating profit margin for 2015 decreased from 2014 primarily due to our acquisition of celesio and the unfavorable impact from the newly launched drugs for hepatitis c, partially offset by our other mix of business. operating profit margin in 2014 was flat compared to 2013 primarily reflecting an increase in gross profit margin and the $191 million impairment charge on an equity investment incurred in 2013, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, which included the effects of our acquisitions. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, operating profit and operating profit margin were also impacted by $150 million, $68 million and $72 million of reserve adjustments for estimated probable losses related to our controlled substance distribution claims and average wholesale price litigation.

mckesson corporation financial review (continued)
technology solutions: operating profit decreased slightly in 2015 and increased in 2014 compared to the prior years. operating profit margin increased in 2015 primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin. operating profit margin increased in 2014 primarily due to an increase in gross profit margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, operating profit and operating profit margin were impacted by $34 million, $57 million and $46 million of charges associated with a depreciation and amortization catch-up related to the prior year, and product alignment and impairment charges.
corporate: corporate expenses, net, increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher other income. corporate expenses, net, for 2013 also included the $81 million gain on business combination.
interest expense: interest expense increased over the last two years primarily due to the march 2014 issuance of $4.1 billion of new debt to fund the acquisition of celesio and due to interest on celesio's debt. interest expense for 2014 also included $46 million of bridge loan fees associated with the initial funding of the acquisition of celesio. partially offsetting these increases, interest expense benefited from the repayment of term debt in the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013. interest expense fluctuates based on timing, amounts and interest rates of term debt that is repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred for bridge loan fees. refer to our discussion under the caption "credit resources" within this financial review for additional information regarding our financing activities.
income taxes our reported income tax rates were 30.7%, 34.9% and 30.1% in 2015, 2014 and 2013. fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates and discrete items. income tax expense included net discrete tax benefits of $33 million in 2015, net discrete tax expenses of $94 million in 2014 and net discrete tax benefits of $29 million in 2013. discrete tax expense for 2014 primarily related to a $122 million charge regarding an unfavorable decision from the tax court of canada with respect to transfer pricing issues.
we have received reassessments from the canada revenue agency ("cra") related to a transfer pricing matter impacting years 2003 through 2010, and have filed notices of appeal to the tax court of canada for all of these years. on december 13, 2013, the tax court of canada dismissed our appeal of the 2003 reassessment and we have filed a notice of appeal to the federal court of appeal regarding this tax year. after the close of 2015, we reached an agreement in principle with the cra to settle the transfer pricing matter for years 2003 through 2010. since the agreement in principle did not occur within 2015, we have not reflected this potential settlement in our 2015 financial statements. we will record the final settlement amount in a subsequent quarter and do not expect it to have a material impact to income tax expense.
during 2015, we reached an agreement with the internal revenue service ("irs") to settle all outstanding issues relating to years 2003 through 2006 and recognized discrete tax benefits of $55 million to record previously unrecognized tax benefits and related interest.
loss from discontinued operations, net of tax losses from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $299 million, $156 million and $25 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
during the fourth quarter of 2015, we committed to a plan to sell our brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business and a small business from our distribution solutions segment, as well as a small business from our technology solutions segment. as a result, we recorded $241 million pre-tax ($235 million after-tax) non-cash impairment charges to write off the business' long‐lived assets and reduce the carrying value of the brazilian business to its estimated fair value, less cost to sell.  the ultimate loss from the sale of the business may be higher or lower than our current assessment of the business' fair value.
in 2014, we committed to a plan to sell our international technology and our hospital automation businesses from our technology solutions segment and certain businesses from our distribution solutions segment.  as a result, we recorded a pre-tax and after-tax $80 million non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the international technology business to its estimated fair value, less cost to sell. a portion of this business was sold in 2015 for nominal proceeds. our hospital automation business was sold in 2014 for net cash proceeds of $55 million which approximated the business' net book value.

mckesson corporation financial review (continued)
as required, we classified the results of operations and cash flows of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements.
net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2015 primarily represents the $50 million guaranteed dividend and $12 million associated with the quarterly accrual of the annual recurring compensation that we are obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio under the domination agreement.  net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2014 primarily represents the portion of celesio's net loss that was not allocable to mckesson corporation.
net income attributable to mckesson corporation: net income attributable to mckesson corporation was $1,476 million, $1,263 million and $1,338 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013 and diluted earnings per common share were $6.27, $5.41 and $5.59.
weighted average diluted common shares outstanding:  diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 235 million, 233 million and 239 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013. weighted average diluted common shares outstanding is impacted by the exercise and settlement of share-based awards and in 2014 the cumulative effect of share repurchases.
foreign operations foreign operations accounted for approximately 20%, 11% and 8% of 2015, 2014 and 2013 consolidated revenues. foreign operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. we monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. additional information regarding our foreign operations is also included in financial note 26, "segments of business," to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10-k.
business combinations fiscal 2014

goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. however, if we acquire the assets of a company, the goodwill may be deductible for tax purposes. the pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions and the results of operations for these acquisitions since the acquisition date have not been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or an aggregate basis.

critical accounting policies and estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. other accounting policies are described in financial note 1, "significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10-k. because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.
allowance for doubtful accounts: we provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. we also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. we estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes portfolio and specific reserves, the company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. if the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers' financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. as a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. during 2015, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 44% of our total consolidated revenues. sales to our largest customer, cvs caremark corporation ("cvs"), accounted for approximately 15% of our total consolidated revenues. at march 31, 2015, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 36% of total trade accounts receivable. accounts receivable from cvs were approximately 14% of total trade accounts receivable. as a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. a default in payments, a material reduction in purchases from these, or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. in addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. we believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2015 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. at this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue.
at march 31, 2015, trade and notes receivables were $13,275 million prior to allowances of $141 million. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, our provision for bad debts was $67 million, $36 million and $28 million. at march 31, 2015 and 2014, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.1% and 0.9%. an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2015 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $13 million. the selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in schedule ii included in this annual report on form 10-k.
inventories: we report inventories at the lower of cost or market ("lcm"). inventories for our distribution solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. for our distribution solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the lifo method. the majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase price using the first-in, first-out method ("fifo"). technology solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method, which approximates average cost. rebates, cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. total inventories were $14.3 billion and $13.0 billion at march 31, 2015 and 2014.
41
mckesson corporation financial review (continued)
the lifo method was used to value approximately 73% and 67% of our inventories at march 31, 2015 and 2014. if we had used the fifo method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement costs, inventories would have been approximately $768 million and $431 million higher than the amounts reported at march 31, 2015 and 2014. these amounts are equivalent to our lifo reserves. our lifo valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. in 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recognized net lifo expense of $337 million, $311 million and $13 million within our consolidated statements of operations. a lifo expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory.
we believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., "market").  as such, our lifo inventory is valued at the lower of lifo or market.  due to cumulative net price deflation from 2005 to 2013, we had a lower-of-cost or market ("lcm") reserve of $60 million at march 31, 2013 which reduced pharmaceutical inventories at lifo to market.  during 2014, the lcm reserve of $60 million was released, resulting in an increase in gross profit.  as of march 31, 2014 and 2015, inventories at lifo did not exceed market.
in determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. we write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews. these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results.
business combinations:  we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained of a business, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.
several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. for intangible assets, we typically use the income method. this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset. these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset's life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. refer to financial note 2, "business combinations," to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our acquisitions.
goodwill and intangible assets:  as a result of acquiring businesses, we have $9,817 million and $9,927 million of goodwill at march 31, 2015 and 2014 and $3,441 million and $4,871 million of intangible assets, net at march 31, 2015 and 2014. we maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired. we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time.
impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a component - one level below our distribution solutions and technology solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.
42
mckesson corporation financial review (continued)
the first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. this step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. if the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value, no further evaluation is necessary. if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. under the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangibles assets, from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test. if the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for that excess.
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return. in addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units' fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values.
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include long-term growth rates, projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units.
estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. in 2015 and 2014, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. in 2013, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $36 million in our technology solutions segment.
currently, all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to thirty-eight years.  we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.  determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value.  assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective.  they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. there were no material impairments of intangibles in 2015, 2014 or 2013.  our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.
supplier reserves: we establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. these reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. we evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. as of march 31, 2015 and 2014, supplier reserves were $167 million and $181 million. the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different from our estimate. all of the supplier reserves at march 31, 2015 and 2014 pertain to our distribution solutions segment. an increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 0.1% of trade payables at march 31, 2015 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $25 million in 2015. the selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.

income taxes: our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. in estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. we had deferred income tax assets (net of valuation allowances) of $1,189 million and $1,286 million at march 31, 2015 and 2014 and deferred tax liabilities of $3,791 million and $4,075 million. deferred tax assets primarily consist of timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals and net operating loss and credit carryforwards. deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation (including inventory valued at lifo) and intangible assets. we established valuation allowances of $229 million and $200 million for 2015 and 2014 against certain deferred tax assets, which primarily relate to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to lifo, our cash flows could be materially impacted.
in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the u.s. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of tax liabilities and related interest. if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized.
if our assumptions and estimates described above were to change, an increase/decrease of 1% in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increased/decreased tax expense by approximately $27 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for 2015.
loss contingencies: we are subject to various claims, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. however, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided.
disclosure is also provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. as discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate.

financial condition, liquidity and capital resources we expect our available cash generated from operations and our short-term investment portfolio, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facilities, revolving credit facilities and commercial paper issuance, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. in addition, we may access the long-term debt capital markets from time-to-time.
net cash flow from operating activities was $3,112 million in 2015 compared to $3,136 million in 2014 and $2,483 million in 2013. operating activities for 2015 were affected by an increase in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases and increases in receivables and inventories primarily associated with our revenue growth. cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. additionally, working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes, inventory requirements and vendor payment terms.
operating activities for 2014 were primarily affected by an increase in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases and increases in receivables and inventories primarily associated with our revenue growth. operating activities for 2013 were primarily affected by $483 million of payments for litigation settlements.
net cash used in investing activities was $677 million in 2015 compared to $5,046 million in 2014 and $2,209 million in 2013. investing activities for 2015 include $170 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, $376 million and $169 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software, and $15 million of net cash proceeds from sales of businesses.
investing activities for 2014 included $4,634 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, including $4,497 million for our acquisition of celesio. investing activities in 2014 also included $278 million and $141 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software, and $97 million of cash proceeds from sales of our automation business and an equity investment.
investing activities for 2013 included $1,873 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, including $1,299 million for our acquisition of pssi. investing activities in 2013 also included $241 million and $159 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software.
financing activities utilized $968 million of cash in 2015, generated net cash of $3,619 million in 2014 and utilized $956 million of cash in 2013. financing activities for 2015 include cash receipts of $3,100 million and payments of $3,152 million from short-term borrowings. long-term debt repayments in 2015 were primarily cash paid on promissory notes. financing activities in 2015 also reflect a cash payment of $32 million to acquire approximately 1 million additional common shares of celesio through the tender offers we completed in 2015. additionally, financing activities for 2015 include $340 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $227 million of dividends paid.
financing activities for 2014 include cash receipts of $6,080 million and cash paid of $6,132 million from short-term borrowings, which includes $4,957 million in borrowings under a senior bridge loan facility in connection with our acquisition of celesio and $400 million under our accounts receivable sales facility in february 2014. these borrowings were fully repaid in march 2014. financing activities for 2014 also include cash receipts of $4,124 million from the issuance of long-term debt in march 2014 and cash paid of $348 million for repayments of long-term debt, primarily consisting of $350 million paid on the maturity of our 6.50% notes due in february 2014. additionally, financing activities for 2014 included $130 million of cash payments for stock repurchases and $214 million of dividends paid.
financing activities for 2013 included cash receipts of $1,325 million and cash paid of $1,725 million from short-term borrowings. in addition, in connection with our acquisition of pssi, we borrowed $900 million for bridge financing in february 2013, which was fully repaid in march 2013. financing activities for 2013 also include cash receipts of $1,798 million for the issuance of long-term debt and cash paid of $1,143 million for repayments of long-term debt. in december 2012, we issued $500 million of 0.95% notes due 2015 and $400 million of 2.70% notes due 2022. in march 2013, we issued $500 million of 1.40% notes due 2018 and $400 million of 2.85% notes due 2023. long-term debt repayments include $500 million paid on the maturity of our 5.25% notes due in march 2013 and $635 million paid to redeem the debt acquired on the acquisition of pssi. additionally, financing activities for 2013 included $1,214 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $194 million of dividends paid.

the company's board has authorized the repurchase of mckesson's common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ("asr") programs, or by any combination of such methods. the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions.
the board authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's common stock in january 2013. in 2015 and 2013, we repurchased 1.5 million and 13 million of our shares through an asr program and open market repurchases:

at march 31, 2015, no authorized amounts remain available for future repurchases of the company's common stock under the january 2013 board approved share purchase plan.
in may 2015, the board authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's common stock.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, we retired approximately 2 million shares repurchased for $217 million by the company.  the retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares. we elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. as such, $195 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings.
we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. however, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.

the remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions. we mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.
our cash and equivalents balance as of march 31, 2015 included approximately $2.3 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states. our primary intent is to utilize this cash in foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time.  although the vast majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to u.s. federal, state and local income tax.
working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. our distribution solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements.
consolidated working capital decreased at march 31, 2015 compared to march 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payable, partially offset by increases in receivables and inventories. consolidated working capital increased at march 31, 2014 compared to march 31, 2013 primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents and increases in receivables and inventories partially offset by increases in current portion of long-term debt associated with our acquisition of celesio.
our ratio of net debt to net capital employed decreased at march 31, 2015 compared to march 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease in total debt, partially offset by the decrease in total mckesson stockholders' equity. our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at march 31, 2014 compared to march 31, 2013 primarily due to the increase in debt associated with our celesio acquisition.
in july 2013, the quarterly dividend was raised from $0.20 to $0.24 per common share for dividends declared after such date, until further action by the board. dividends were $0.96 per share in 2015, $0.92 per share in 2014 and $0.80 per share in 2013. the company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future.  however, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the board and will depend upon the company's future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, we paid total cash dividends of $227 million, $214 million and $194 million. additionally, as required under the domination agreement, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per celesio share (effective january 1, 2015) to the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio.

at march 31, 2015, the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to celesio was $1.4 billion, which exceeded the maximum redemption value of $1.2 billion. the balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. upon the effectiveness of the domination agreement on december 2, 2014, the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio received a put right that enables them to put their celesio shares to mckesson at €22.99 per share, which price is increased annually for interest in the amount of 5 percentage points above a base rate published by the german bundesbank semiannually, less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid ("put amount").  the redemption value is the put amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period. the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the put amount are uncertain. refer to financial notes 2 and 3, "business combinations" and "noncontrolling interests," to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.

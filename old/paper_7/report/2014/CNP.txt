item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 herein.
overview background we are a public utility holding company. our operating subsidiaries own and operate electric transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas distribution facilities and own interests in enable midstream partners, lp (enable) as described below. our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries include:
•   centerpoint energy houston electric, llc (centerpoint houston), which engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in a 5,000-square mile area of the texas gulf coast that includes the city of houston; and
•   centerpoint energy resources corp. (cerc corp. and, together with its subsidiaries, cerc), which owns and operates natural gas distribution systems. a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp. offers variable and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities. as of december 31, 2014, cerc corp. also owned approximately 55.4% of the limited partner interests in enable, which owns, operates and develops natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets.
business segments in this management's discussion and analysis, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments. we also discuss our liquidity, capital resources and certain critical accounting policies. we are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on these segments of the energy business. the results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, economic conditions, cost management, competition, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction we are subject. our electric transmission and distribution services are subject to rate regulation and are reported in the electric transmission & distribution business segment, as are impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility. our natural gas distribution services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in the natural gas distribution business segment. the results of our midstream investments segment are dependent upon the results of enable, which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas that enable gathers, processes and transports across its systems and other factors as discussed below under "- factors influencing our midstream investments segment." a summary of our reportable business segments as of december 31, 2014 is set forth below:
electric transmission & distribution our electric transmission and distribution operations provide electric transmission and distribution services to retail electric providers (reps) serving over two million metered customers in a 5,000-square-mile area of the texas gulf coast that has a population of approximately six million people and includes the city of houston.
on behalf of reps, centerpoint houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations, from one substation to another and to retail electric customers in locations throughout centerpoint houston's certificated service territory. the electric reliability council of texas, inc. (ercot) serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in texas. ercot membership is open to consumer groups, investor and municipally-owned electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, independent generators, power marketers, river authorities and reps. the ercot market represents approximately 85% of the demand for power in texas and is one of the nation's largest power markets. transmission and distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the public utility commission of texas (texas utility commission).
42
natural gas distribution cerc owns and operates our regulated natural gas distribution business (ngd), which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation for, approximately 3.4 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in arkansas, louisiana, minnesota, mississippi, oklahoma and texas.
energy services cerc's operations also include non-rate regulated natural gas sales to, and transportation services for, commercial and industrial customers in 23 states in the central united states.
midstream investments we have a significant equity investment in enable, an unconsolidated subsidiary that owns, operates and develops natural gas and crude oil assets. our midstream investments segment includes equity earnings associated with the operations of enable and a 0.1% interest in southeast supply header, llc (sesh) owned by cerc.
other operations our other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operations.
executive summary factors influencing our businesses we are an energy delivery company. the majority of our revenues are generated from the sale of natural gas and the transmission and delivery of electricity by our subsidiaries. we do not own or operate electric generating facilities or make retail sales to end-use electric customers. to assess our financial performance, our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows from our business segments. within these broader financial measures, we monitor margins, operation and maintenance expense, interest expense, capital spending and working capital requirements. in addition to these financial measures we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to the operation of our business segments, including the number of customers, throughput, use per customer, commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days. we also monitor system reliability, safety factors and customer satisfaction to gauge our performance.
to the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers, results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer.  reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry. also, adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment, may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, resulting in less demand for our services.
performance of our electric transmission & distribution and natural gas distribution business segments is significantly influenced by the number of customers and energy usage per customer. weather conditions can have a significant impact on energy usage, and we compare our results on a weather adjusted basis.  in 2012, we generally experienced normal weather in the summer months. however, every state in which we distribute natural gas had the warmest winter on record. in 2013, we experienced a colder than normal spring and very cold weather in november and december in houston and all of the states in which we have gas customers. the cooler weather continued into 2014 and throughout the year, resulting in a colder than normal january and february and milder temperatures for the rest of the year, including the summer months, in the houston area. long term national trends indicate customers have reduced their energy consumption, and reduced consumption can adversely affect our results. however, due to more affordable energy prices and continued economic improvement in the areas we serve, the trend toward lower usage has slowed in some of the areas we serve.  in addition, in many of our service areas, particularly in the houston area and in minnesota, we have benefited from a growth in the number of customers that also tends to mitigate the effects of reduced consumption.  we anticipate that this trend will continue as the regions' economies continue to grow.  the profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and gas distribution rates.
our energy services business segment contracts with customers for transportation, storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis.  its operations serve customers in the central united states.  the segment benefits from favorable price differentials, either on a geographic basis or on a seasonal basis. while this business utilizes financial derivatives to hedge its exposure to price movements, it does not engage in speculative or proprietary trading and maintains a low value at risk level, or
43
var, to avoid significant financial exposures.  in 2014, basis volatility created asset optimization revenues not experienced in many years and the extreme cold weather increased throughput and margin from our weather sensitive customers. lower geographic and seasonal price differentials during 2013 and 2012 adversely affected results for this business segment.
the nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment, and we rely on internally generated cash, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs. we strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities in order to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable. a reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt, as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities, and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets. disruptions in the financial markets can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive. in those circumstances, companies like us may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept. for that reason, we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt.
we expect to make contributions to our pension plans aggregating approximately $66 million in 2015 and may need to make larger contributions in subsequent years. consistent with the regulatory treatment of such costs, we can defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in our base rates for our electric transmission & distribution business segment and ngd in texas.
factors influencing our midstream investments segment the results of our midstream investments segment are primarily dependent upon the results of enable, which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas that enable gathers, processes and transports across its systems, which depends significantly on the level of production from natural gas wells connected to its systems across a number of u.s. mid-continent markets. aggregate production volumes are affected by the overall amount of oil and gas drilling and completion activities, as production must be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity, because the production rate of oil and gas wells declines over time.
oil and gas producers' willingness to engage in new drilling is determined by a number of factors, the most important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of natural gas, ngls and crude oil, the cost to drill and operate a well, the availability and cost of capital and environmental and government regulations. prices of natural gas, crude oil, and ngls have historically experienced periods of significant volatility. enable's results are also impacted by commodity price differentials between receipt and delivery points on its systems across the various markets that it serves. enable has attempted to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on its business by entering into hedges, focusing on contracting fee-based business, and converting existing commodity-based contracts to fee-based contracts. recently, the prices of crude oil, ngls and natural gas have declined significantly. should lower commodity prices persist, enable's future volumes and cash flows may be negatively impacted. the level of drilling is expected to positively correlate with long-term trends in commodity prices. similarly, production levels nationally and regionally generally tend to positively correlate with drilling activity.
over the past several years, there has been a fundamental shift in u.s. natural gas and crude oil production towards tight gas formations and shale plays. the emergence of these plays and advancements in technology have been crucial factors that have allowed producers to efficiently extract significant volumes of natural gas, ngls and crude oil. recently, declining crude oil and natural gas liquids prices have resulted in current and anticipated decreases in crude oil and natural gas drilling activity. should lower prices and producer activity persist for a sustained period, enable's future volumes and cash flows may be negatively impacted. to maintain and increase throughput volumes on its systems, enable must continue to contract its capacity to shippers, including producers and marketers. enable's transportation and storage systems compete for customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, receipt and delivery points and geographic flexibility and available capacity and price. to maintain and increase enable's transportation and storage volumes, it must continue to contract its capacity to shippers, including producers, marketers, ldcs, power generators and industrial end-users.
natural gas continues to be a critical component of energy supply and demand in the united states. over the long term, enable's management believes that the prospects for continued natural gas demand are favorable and will be driven by population and economic growth, as well as the continued displacement of coal-fired electricity generation by natural gas-fired electricity generation due to the low prices of natural gas and stricter government environmental regulations on the mining and burning of coal. according to the u.s. energy information administration (eia), demand for natural gas in the electric power sector is projected to increase from approximately 9.3 tcf in 2012 to approximately 11.2 tcf in 2040, with a portion of the growth attributable to the retirement of 50 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity by 2020. the eia also projects that natural gas consumption in the industrial sector will be higher due to the rejuvenation of the industrial sector as it benefits from low natural gas prices. however, the eia expects growth in natural gas consumption for power generation and in the industrial sector to be partially offset by decreased
44
usage in the residential sector. enable's management believes that increasing consumption of natural gas over the long term will continue to drive demand for enable's natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and storage services.
enable depends on access to the capital markets to fund expansion capital expenditures. historically, unit prices of publicly traded midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility. in addition, because enable's common units are yield-based securities, rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of enable's common units to investors. capital market volatility could limit enable's ability to timely issue units or debt on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions. our midstream investments segment currently includes a 0.1% interest in sesh owned by cerc that may be contributed by cerc to enable in the future, upon exercise of certain put or call rights under which cerc would contribute to enable cerc's retained interest in sesh.
significant events enable initial public offering. on april 16, 2014, enable midstream partners, lp (enable) completed its initial public offering (ipo) of 28,750,000 common units at a price of $20.00 per unit, which included 3,750,000 common units sold by arclight capital partners, llc (arclight) pursuant to an over-allotment option that was fully exercised by the underwriters. enable received $464 million in net proceeds from the sale of the units, after deducting underwriting fees, structuring fees and other offering costs.
in connection with its ipo, on march 25, 2014, enable effected a 1 for 1.279082616 reverse unit split. immediately following the unit split, centerpoint energy resources corp. (cerc corp.) owned 227,508,825 common units, representing a 58.3% limited partner interest in enable. also in connection with enable's ipo, 139,704,916 of cerc corp.'s common units were converted into subordinated units. the principal difference between enable common units and subordinated units is that in any quarter during the subordination period, holders of the subordinated units are not entitled to receive any distribution of available cash until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution from prior quarters. if enable does not pay distributions on its subordinated units, the subordinated units will not accrue arrearages for those unpaid distributions. at the end of the subordination period, centerpoint energy's subordinated units in enable will be converted to common units in enable on a one-for-one basis.
subsequent to the ipo, enable continues to be controlled jointly by centerpoint energy and oge; each own 50% of the management rights in the general partner of enable. centerpoint energy and oge also own a 40% and 60% economic interest, respectively, in the incentive distribution rights held by the general partner of enable.
as a result of enable's ipo, centerpoint energy's limited partner interest in enable was reduced from approximately 58.3% to approximately 54.7%. centerpoint energy accounted for the dilution of its investment in enable as a result of enable's ipo as a failed partial sale of in-substance real estate. centerpoint energy did not receive any cash from enable's ipo and, as such, centerpoint energy did not recognize a gain or loss. centerpoint energy's basis difference in enable was reduced for the impact of the enable ipo.
in accordance with the enable formation agreements, centerpoint energy had certain put rights, and enable had certain call rights, exercisable with respect to the 25.05% interest in sesh retained by centerpoint energy on may 1, 2013 (closing date), under which centerpoint energy would contribute its retained interest in sesh, in exchange for a specified number of limited partner units in enable and a cash payment, payable either from centerpoint energy to enable or from enable to centerpoint energy, to the extent of changes in the value of sesh subject to certain restrictions. specifically, the rights were and are exercisable with respect to (1) a 24.95% interest in sesh (24.95% put), which closed on may 30, 2014 as discussed below and (2) a 0.1% interest in sesh, which may be exercised no earlier than june 2015 for 25,341 common units in enable.
on may 30, 2014, centerpoint energy closed its 24.95% put and contributed to enable its 24.95% interest in sesh in exchange for 6,322,457 common units of enable, which increased centerpoint energy's limited partner interest in enable from approximately 54.7% to approximately 55.4%. no cash payment was required to be made pursuant to the enable formation agreements in connection with centerpoint energy's exercise of the 24.95% put. centerpoint energy accounted for the contribution of its 24.95% interest in sesh to enable in exchange for common units of enable as a non-monetary transaction of in-substance real estate equity method investments. as such, centerpoint energy recorded the 6,322,457 common units at the historical cost of the contributed 24.95% interest in sesh of $196 million and recorded no gain or loss in connection with its exercise of the 24.95% put. as a result, centerpoint energy's basis difference in enable was reduced for the impact of its exercise of the 24.95% put.
centerpoint energy incurred natural gas expenses, including transportation and storage costs, of $130 million and $123 million, during the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for transactions with enable occurring on or after the closing date.
45
as of december 31, 2014, centerpoint energy held an approximate 55.4% limited partner interest in enable consisting of 94,126,366 common units and 139,704,916 subordinated units and a 0.1% interest in sesh. on december 31, 2014, enable's common units closed at $19.39 per unit on the new york stock exchange.
debt matters. approximately $44 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on behalf of centerpoint energy houston electric, llc (centerpoint houston) were redeemed on march 3, 2014 at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued interest. the bonds had an interest rate of 4.25%, were scheduled to mature in 2017 and were collateralized by general mortgage bonds of centerpoint houston.
approximately $56 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on behalf of centerpoint houston were purchased by centerpoint houston on march 3, 2014 at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the mandatory tender provisions of the bonds. the bonds had an interest rate of 5.60% prior to centerpoint houston's purchase and have a variable rate thereafter. the bonds mature in 2027 and are collateralized by general mortgage bonds of centerpoint houston. the purchased pollution control bonds may be remarketed.
on march 17, 2014, centerpoint houston issued $600 million principal amount of 4.50% general mortgage bonds due 2044. the proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used for general limited liability company purposes, including the repayment of short-term notes payable to affiliated companies.
approximately $84 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on behalf of centerpoint energy houston electric, llc (centerpoint houston) were redeemed on june 2, 2014 at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest. the bonds had an interest rate of 4.25%, were scheduled to mature in 2017 and were collateralized by general mortgage bonds of centerpoint houston.
on september 9, 2014, our revolving credit facility and the revolving credit facilities of centerpoint houston and cerc corp. were amended to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the commitments under the credit facilities from september 9, 2018 to september 9, 2019. the amendments also reduced the swingline and letter of credit sub-facilities under each credit facility, with total commitments under each credit facility remaining unchanged.

2014 compared to 2013
net income.  we reported net income of $611 million ($1.42 per diluted share) for 2014 compared to $311 million ($0.72 per diluted share) for the same period in 2013. the increase in net income of $300 million was primarily due to a $196 million decrease in income tax expense discussed below, a $120 million increase in equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, a $107 million decrease in the loss on our indexed debt securities, a $13 million decrease in interest expense and a $12 million increase in other income, which were partially offset by a $75 million decrease in operating income (discussed below by segment) and a $73 million decrease in the gain on our marketable securities.
income tax expense. we reported an effective tax rate of 31.0% and 60.2% for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  the effective tax rate of 31.0% for 2014 is primarily due to a $29 million tax benefit recognized upon completion of a tax basis balance sheet review and a $13 million reversal of previously accrued taxes as a result of final positions taken in the 2013 tax returns.  we determined the impact of the $29 million adjustment was not material to any prior period or the year ended december 31, 2014.  the effective tax rate of 60.2% for 2013 is primarily attributable to a net $196 million charge to deferred tax expense due to the formation of enable. for more information, see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
2013 compared to 2012
net income.  we reported net income of $311 million ($0.72 per diluted share) for 2013 compared to $417 million ($0.97 per diluted share) for the same period in 2012. the decrease in net income of $106 million was primarily due to a $136 million non-cash step acquisition gain related to the acquisition of an additional 50% interest in waskom in 2012, a $130 million increase in income tax expense discussed below, a $122 million increase in the loss on our indexed debt securities and a $28 million decrease in operating income (discussed below by segment). operating income in 2012 included a $252 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. these decreases were partially offset by a $157 million increase in equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, a $85 million decrease in interest expense and a $82 million increase in the gain on our marketable securities.
income tax expense. we reported an effective tax rate of 60.2% for 2013 compared to 44.9% for the same period in 2012. our effective tax rate for 2013 increased by 15.3% primarily as a result of the formation of enable with deferred tax expense of $225 million related to the book-to-tax basis difference for contributed non-tax deductible goodwill and a tax benefit of $29 million

associated with the remeasurement of state deferred taxes at formation. in addition, we recognized a tax benefit of $8 million based on the settlement with the internal revenue service (irs) of outstanding tax claims for the 2002 and 2003 audit cycles. our effective tax rate for 2013 was approximately 36.2% excluding the tax effects from the adjustments described above.
our effective tax rate for 2012 of 44.9% was primarily impacted by an increase in tax expense of $88 million related to the non-tax deductible impairment of goodwill of $252 million and a reduction in tax expense of $28 million for the release of tax reserves settled with the irs. our effective tax rate for 2012 was approximately 37% excluding the tax effects from the adjustments described above.

2014 compared to 2013.  our electric transmission & distribution business segment reported operating income of $595 million for 2014, consisting of $477 million from our regulated electric transmission and distribution utility operations (tdu) and $118 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. for 2013, operating income totaled $607 million, consisting of $474 million from the tdu and $133 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. tdu operating income increased $3 million due to customer growth ($33 million) from the addition of almost 55,000 new customers, higher equity return ($23 million), primarily related to true-up proceeds and higher energy efficiency performance bonus ($15 million), partially offset by increased labor and support services costs ($21 million), increased contracts and services ($19 million), lower right of way revenues ($8 million), increased depreciation ($8 million), an adjustment to our claims liability reserve ($6 million) and decreased usage ($5 million), primarily due to milder weather. increased transmission costs of $168 million were largely offset by increased transmission revenue.
2013 compared to 2012.  our electric transmission & distribution business segment reported operating income of $607 million for 2013, consisting of $474 million from the tdu and $133 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. for 2012, operating income totaled $639 million, consisting of $492 million from the tdu and $147 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. tdu operating income decreased $18 million due to decreased usage ($13 million), primarily due to unfavorable weather, increased taxes other than income taxes ($11 million), increased depreciation ($10 million, excluding $8 million from increased investment in ams offset by the related revenues), increased labor and benefits costs ($7 million), increased contracts and services ($4 million), increased support services ($4 million) and increased insurance costs

2014 compared to 2013.  our natural gas distribution business segment reported operating income of $287 million for 2014 compared to $263 million for 2013. operating income increased $24 million primarily due to increased usage as a result of colder weather compared to the prior year, partially mitigated by weather hedges and weather normalization adjustments ($16 million), rate increases ($37 million) and increased economic activity across our footprint including the addition of approximately 36,000 customers ($10 million). these increases were partially offset by increased contractor expense, including pipeline integrity work ($10 million), higher depreciation and amortization ($16 million), an increase in taxes ($7 million), and increased other operating expenses ($6 million). increased expense related to energy efficiency programs ($8 million) and increased expense related to higher gross receipt taxes ($4 million) were offset by a corresponding increase in the related revenues.
2013 compared to 2012.  our natural gas distribution business segment reported operating income of $263 million for 2013 compared to $226 million for 2012. operating income increased $37 million primarily due to increased usage as a result of colder weather compared to the prior year, partially mitigated by weather hedges and weather normalization adjustments ($29 million), rate increases ($29 million), and increased economic activity across our footprint including the addition of approximately 33,000 residential customers ($7 million). these increases were partially offset by increased operating expenses ($6 million), higher bad debt expense ($5 million), higher depreciation and amortization expense ($12 million) and an increase in taxes ($5 million), primarily attributable to property taxes. increased expense related to energy efficiency programs ($17 million) and increased expense related to higher gross receipt taxes ($26 million) were offset by a corresponding increase in the related revenues.

2014 compared to 2013. our energy services business segment reported operating income of $52 million compared to $13 million for 2013. the increase in operating income of $39 million was primarily due to a $31 million increase from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins. a $29 million mark-to-market gain was incurred in 2014 compared to a charge of $2 million in 2013. the remaining increase in operating income was primarily due to improved margins resulting from weather-related optimization of existing gas transportation assets, reduced fixed costs and increased throughput and price volatility.
2013 compared to 2012. our energy services business segment reported operating income of $13 million compared to $2 million for 2012, excluding the goodwill impairment charge discussed below. the increase in operating income of $11 million was primarily due to a $14 million increase from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins. a $2 million mark-to-market charge was incurred in 2013 compared to a charge of $16 million for 2012.  energy services grew both volume and customers in 2013 offsetting the impact of the lower unit margin environment.
goodwill impairment a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $252 million for our energy services business segment was recorded in 2012. the adverse wholesale market conditions facing our energy services business, specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials for natural gas, led to a reduction in our estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this reporting unit.

2014 compared to 2013. our other operations business segment reported operating income of $1 million for 2014 compared to an operating loss of $18 million for 2013. the increase in operating income of $19 million is primarily related to the costs associated with the formation of enable in 2013 ($13 million) and decreased benefits costs ($8 million), which were partially offset by higher property taxes ($2 million).
2013 compared to 2012. our other operations business segment reported an operating loss of $18 million for 2013 compared to operating income of $2 million for 2012. the decrease in operating income of $20 million is primarily related to the costs associated with the formation of enable ($13 million), higher depreciation expense ($3 million) and higher property taxes ($2 million).

cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased $216 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to increased net tax payments ($157 million), decreased cash provided by fuel cost recovery ($149 million), increased net margin deposits ($95 million), decreased cash related to gas storage inventory ($69 million), decreased cash from non-trading derivatives ($38 million) and decreased cash provided by net regulatory assets and liabilities ($39 million), which was partially offset by increased distributions from equity method investments ($176 million) and increased cash provided by net accounts receivable/payable ($140 million).
net cash provided by operating activities decreased $247 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to decreased operating income ($280 million), excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $252 million, decreased cash provided by net accounts receivable/payable ($108 million), cash related to gas storage inventory ($43 million), decreased net margin deposits ($37 million), decreased cash from non-trading derivatives ($16 million), increased pension contributions ($9 million) and decreased cash provided by net regulatory assets and liabilities ($5 million), which was partially offset by increased cash provided by fuel cost recovery ($160 million), increased distributions from equity method investments ($91 million) and decreased net tax payments ($11 million).

cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased $84 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to increased capital expenditures ($86 million), increased restricted cash ($24 million) and decreased proceeds from sale of marketable securities ($9 million), which were partially offset by decreased cash contributed to enable ($38 million).
net cash used in investing activities decreased $303 million in 2013 compared to 2012 due to decreased cash paid for acquisitions ($360 million) and decreased restricted cash ($30 million) and increased proceeds from sale of marketable securities ($9 million), which were partially offset by increased capital expenditures ($74 million) and cash contributed to enable ($38 million).
cash provided by (used in) financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased $828 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to decreased payments of long-term debt ($1,036 million) and increased proceeds from commercial paper ($296 million), which were partially offset by decreased proceeds from long-term debt ($450 million) and increased payments of common stock dividends ($53 million).
net cash used in financing activities increased $920 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to decreased proceeds from long-term debt ($1,445 million) and increased payments of common stock dividends ($9 million), which were partially offset by increased proceeds from commercial paper ($403 million), decreased cash paid for debt retirement ($62 million), increased short-term borrowings ($29 million), decreased payments of long-term debt ($17 million) and decreased debt issuance costs ($13 million).
future sources and uses of cash our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs and various regulatory actions. our principal anticipated cash requirements for 2015 include the following:
•   capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion;
•   scheduled principal payments on transition and system restoration bonds of $372 million;
•   maturing senior notes and pollution control bonds aggregating $269 million;
•   contributions aggregating approximately $66 million to qualified and non-qualified pension plans; and
•   dividend payments on centerpoint energy common stock and interest payments on debt.
we expect that anticipated 2015 cash needs will be met with borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper, proceeds from the issuance of general mortgage bonds and senior unsecured notes, anticipated cash flows from operations, a tax refund relating to 2014 bonus depreciation and distributions from enable. discretionary financing or refinancing may result in the issuance of equity or debt securities in the capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. issuances of equity or debt in the capital markets and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available to us on acceptable terms.

(1)   2.0% zero-premium exchangeable subordinated notes due 2029 (zens) obligations are included in the 2020 and thereafter column at their contingent principal amount as of december 31, 2014 of $751 million. these obligations are exchangeable for cash at any time at the option of the holders for 95% of the current value of the reference shares attributable to each zens ($930 million at december 31, 2014), as discussed in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.
(2)   we calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for fixed-rate debt and term debt, we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate debt and/or non-term debt, we used interest rates in place as of december 31, 2014. we typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings.
(3)   for a discussion of operating leases, please read note 14(c) to our consolidated financial statements.
(4)   in 2015, we expect to make contributions to our qualified pension plan aggregating approximately $35 million. we expect to contribute approximately $31 million and $17 million, respectively, to our non-qualified pension and postretirement benefits plans in 2015.
(5)   for a discussion of other commodity commitments, please read note 14(a) to our consolidated financial statements.
(6)   this table does not include estimated future payments for expected future asset retirement obligations. these payments are primarily estimated to be incurred after 2020. we record a separate liability for the fair value of these asset retirement obligations which totaled $176 million as of december 31, 2014. see note 3(c), asset retirement obligation in our consolidated financial statements.

off-balance sheet arrangements prior to the distribution of our ownership in reliant resources, inc. (rri) to our shareholders, cerc had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became rri's trading subsidiary.  when the companies separated, rri agreed to secure cerc against obligations under the guarantees rri had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation.  pursuant to such agreement, as amended in december 2007, rri (now genon energy, inc. (genon)) agreed to provide to cerc cash or letters of credit as security against cerc's obligations under its remaining guarantees for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose cerc to a risk of loss on those guarantees based on an annual calculation, with any required collateral to be posted each december.  the undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be in effect until 2018, was approximately $42 million as of december 31, 2014.  based on market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2014 at the time the most recent annual calculation was made under the agreement, genon was not obligated to post any security. if genon should fail to perform the contractual obligations, cerc could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, any collateral provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy cerc's obligations.
centerpoint energy has provided guarantees (centerpoint midstream guarantees) with respect to the performance of certain obligations of enable under long-term gas gathering and treating agreements with an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of encana corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of royal dutch shell plc. as of december 31, 2014, centerpoint energy, inc. had guaranteed enable's obligations up to an aggregate amount of $100 million under these agreements. under the terms of the omnibus agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the formation of enable, enable and centerpoint energy have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate with each other to terminate the centerpoint midstream guarantees and to release centerpoint energy from such guarantees by causing enable or one of its subsidiaries to enter into substitute guarantees or to assume the centerpoint midstream guarantees as applicable.
cerc corp. has also provided a guarantee of collection of $1.1 billion of enable's senior notes due 2019 and 2024. this guarantee is subordinated to all senior debt of cerc corp. and is subject to automatic release on may 1, 2016.
the fair value of these guarantees is not material. other than the guarantees described above and operating leases, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
regulatory matters centerpoint houston
2008 energy efficiency cost recovery factor (eecrf) appeal. in october 2009, the public utility commission of texas (texas utility commission) issued an order disallowing recovery of a performance bonus of $2 million on approximately $10 million in 2008 energy efficiency costs expended pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement in a prior rate case. centerpoint houston appealed the denial of the full 2008 performance bonus. centerpoint houston had also appealed similar orders by the texas utility commission providing for the partial disallowance of performance bonuses totaling approximately $5.5 million relating to centerpoint houston's 2009, 2010 and 2011 (only through august 2011) energy efficiency programs. these subsequent cases were abated pending the final outcome of the 2008 bonus appeal. in august 2013, the court of appeals reversed the texas utility commission's decision disallowing such bonuses and in january 2014, the texas supreme court declined to hear the texas utility commission's appeal. as a result of the texas supreme court's decision, in april 2014, four separate proceedings were initiated, which were later consolidated into one proceeding, at the texas utility commission to determine the amount centerpoint houston is to recover. in may 2014, parties to the proceeding entered into a unanimous stipulation agreeing to the amount to be recovered but not to the customer class recovery allocation. the parties agreed that centerpoint houston is to recover $7.5 million in performance bonus, $0.2 million in rate case expenses associated with appeals of the proceedings and at least $2.5 million in carrying costs, with final determination of carrying costs based on the timing of the decision regarding customer class recovery allocation. in august 2014, the texas utility commission entered a final order approving $10.4 million with no change regarding customer class recovery allocation. the rates became effective october 15, 2014. starting september 2011, centerpoint houston's energy efficiency programs are no longer funded pursuant to the terms of the prior settlement, and performance bonus calculations subsequent to that date are not affected by the court's decision.
2014 eecrf. on may 30, 2014, centerpoint houston filed an application for approval of an adjustment to its eecrf for 2015. centerpoint houston's requested recovery is $51.4 million composed of approximately: (1) $39.1 million in estimated 2015 program costs; (2) a performance bonus for 2013 achievements of $16.2 million; (3) $0.9 million for 2015 evaluation, measurement and verification costs; (4) a credit of $5.1 million for the over-recovery of 2013 program costs; and (5) $0.2 million in rate case expenses from the 2013 eecrf proceeding. in september 2014, the parties signed a partial stipulation
58
agreeing that centerpoint houston shall be allowed to recover the net of (1) $39.1 million in estimated 2015 program costs; (2) a performance bonus for 2013 achievements of between $15.8 million and $16.2 million, depending on the outcome of the one remaining contested issue relating to a bonus calculation; (3) $0.9 million for 2015 evaluation, measurement and verification costs; (4) a credit of $5.1 million for the over-recovery of 2013 program costs; (5) $0.2 million in rate case expenses from the 2013 eecrf proceeding; and (6) an adjustment of $57,000 to exclude certain administrative costs.  in november 2014, the texas utility commission approved the partial settlement and decided the remaining contested issue relating to the bonus calculation in centerpoint energy's favor. the effective date of the rate adjustment will be march 1, 2015.
brazos valley connection project. in july 2013, centerpoint houston and other transmission service providers submitted analyses and transmission proposals to the electric reliability council of texas (ercot) for an additional transmission path into the houston region.  in april 2014, ercot's board of directors voted to endorse a houston region transmission project and deemed it critical for reliability. the project will consist of (i) construction of a new double-circuit 345 kilovolt (kv) line spanning 130 miles, (ii) upgrades to three substations to accommodate new connections and additional capacity, and (iii) improvements to approximately 11 miles of an existing 345 kv th wharton-addicks transmission line to increase its rating.  also in april 2014, ercot staff determined that centerpoint houston would be the designated transmission service provider for the portion of the project between our zenith substation and the gibbons creek substation owned by the texas municipal power agency, consisting of approximately 60 miles of 345 kv transmission line, upgrades to the limestone and zenith substations and upgrades to 11 miles of the 345 kv th wharton-addicks transmission line (this portion of the houston region transmission project is referred to by centerpoint houston as the brazos valley connection).  other transmission service providers were designated by ercot for the portion of the project from gibbons creek substation to the limestone substation as well as the upgrades to the gibbons creek substation.  as the owner of the originating and terminating substations of the entire project, centerpoint houston appealed that determination to the texas utility commission in may 2014 and sought the right to construct, own, and maintain the entire project, except for necessary upgrades to the gibbons creek substation.  on october 17, 2014, the texas utility commission filed an order that denied centerpoint houston's appeal and upheld the april 2014 ercot decision to split the project between centerpoint houston and other transmission service providers.  ercot estimates that the capital cost of the entire houston region transmission project will be approximately $600 million, and centerpoint houston estimates that the capital costs for the brazos valley connection will be approximately $300 million.  centerpoint houston anticipates that the brazos valley connection project will be completed by mid-2018.
in may 2014, several electric generators appealed the ercot board of directors' april 2014 approval of the houston region transmission project and the determination that the project was critical for reliability in the houston region to the texas utility commission.  a hearing on the may 2014 appeal by the electric generators was held in october 2014 and in december 2014, the texas utility commission denied the generators' appeal. a motion for rehearing was filed by the electric generators on january 5, 2015, replies to the motion for rehearing were filed on january 15, 2015, and on january 21, 2015, the texas utility commission voted not to consider the motion for rehearing. centerpoint houston must obtain final approval of the project and the route for the project from the texas utility commission. centerpoint houston anticipates filing its application for approval of the project in the spring of 2015. once filed, the texas utility commission will have 180 days to rule on the application.
transmission cost of service (tcos). on march 26, 2014, centerpoint houston filed an application with the texas utility commission for an interim update of its tcos seeking an increase in annual revenue of $13.6 million based on an increase in total rate base of $184.5 million. centerpoint houston received approval from the texas utility commission during the second quarter of 2014, and rates became effective may 12, 2014. a second tcos filing, as amended, was made on november 21, 2014 seeking an increase in annual revenue of $23.5 million based on an increase in total rate base of $113.2 million.  the case is still pending before the texas utility commission.
agreement with city of houston. on june 13, 2014, centerpoint houston entered into an agreement with the city of houston, texas providing that neither centerpoint houston nor the city will initiate a base rate case for centerpoint houston earlier than december 31, 2016, subject to a $20 million force majeure provision. during that period, centerpoint houston has the right to adjust its rates through (1) the schedules and riders in its tariff approved by the texas utility commission; (2) adjustments to its distribution rates using the distribution cost recovery factor rule adopted by the texas utility commission; and (3) adjustments to its transmission rates under texas utility commission rules. centerpoint houston also has the right to propose rates for new services. this agreement is not binding on any other city within centerpoint houston's service territory or the texas utility commission.

cerc cost of service adjustment (cosa) rate adjustments. in march 2008, ngd filed a request to change its rates with the railroad commission of texas (railroad commission) and the 47 cities in its texas coast service territory, including a request for an annual cost of service adjustment mechanism, or cosa, that adjusts rates annually for changes in invested capital as well as certain operating expenses. in 2008, the railroad commission approved the implementation of rates increasing annual revenues from the texas coast service territory by approximately $3.5 million and a cosa mechanism. the approved rates were contested by a coalition of nine cities and certain state agencies in an appeal to the travis county district court. in 2010, the district court ruled that the railroad commission lacked authority to impose the approved cosa mechanism both in those nine cities and in those areas in which the railroad commission has original jurisdiction, and also found that the commission's order lacked findings to support the inclusion of certain affiliate expenses in rates. the decision by the district court placed at risk certain revenues collected pursuant to cosa mechanisms. the railroad commission and ngd appealed the court's ruling on the cosa mechanism. in october 2011, the court of appeals reversed the district court's ruling on the cosa mechanism. the cities and state agencies appealed that decision to the texas supreme court. in january 2014, the texas supreme court confirmed that the railroad commission had authority to approve the cosa rate adjustments utilized by ngd and remanded the case back to state district court. in april 2014, the district court remanded the case to the railroad commission to correct deficiencies in the commission's 2008 order related to certain affiliate expenses but affirming the commission's order in all other respects. the matter is currently pending at the railroad commission.
minnesota rate proceeding.  on august 2, 2013, ngd filed a general rate case in minnesota to increase base rates by $44.3 million (including the movement of a $15 million energy efficiency rider into base rates), based on a rate base of $700 million and return on equity (roe) of 10.3%.  in compliance with state law, ngd implemented interim rates reflecting $42.9 million dollars of the requested increase for gas used on and after october 1, 2013. this rate filing is intended to recover significant capital expenditures ngd is making in minnesota and included moving $15 million of energy efficiency expenditures to base rates. evidentiary hearings were held before an administrative law judge (alj) in january 2014. on april 9, 2014 the alj issued its findings of fact and recommendations, which support a $31.6 million revenue increase based on a 9.59% roe.  in may 2014, the minnesota public utility commission (mpuc) entered an order approving a rate increase of $33 million based on a 9.59% roe and a 52.6% equity ratio. the mpuc also authorized the implementation of a three-year pilot revenue decoupling mechanism with an effective date of july 1, 2015. ngd implemented final rates in the fourth quarter of 2014. since the adopted revenue increase is less than the interim revenue increase, a refund to customers, which had already been accrued, was completed in december 2014.
houston, south texas and beaumont/east texas gas reliability infrastructure programs (grip). ngd's houston, south texas and beaumont/east texas divisions each submitted annual grip filings on march 31, 2014. for the houston division, cerc has asked that its grip filing to recover costs related to $66.6 million in incremental capital expenditures that were incurred in 2013 be operationally suspended for one year so as to ensure earnings more consistent with those currently approved. for the south texas division, the filing is to recover costs related to $15.9 million in incremental capital expenditures that were incurred in 2013. the increase in revenue requirements for this filing period is $1.8 million annually based on an authorized rate of return of 8.75%. rates were implemented for certain customers in may 2014. in those areas in which the jurisdictional deadline was extended by regulatory action, the rates were implemented in july 2014 after final approval by the railroad commission of texas (railroad commission). for the beaumont/east texas division, the first grip filing is to recover costs related to $31.4 million in incremental capital expenditures that were incurred in 2012 and 2013. the increase in revenue requirements for this filing period is $3.0 million annually based on an authorized rate of return of 8.51%. rates were implemented for certain customers in may 2014. in those areas in which the jurisdictional deadline was extended by regulatory action, the rates were implemented in july 2014 after final approval by the railroad commission.
oklahoma performance based rate change (pbrc). in march 2014, ngd made a pbrc filing for the 2013 calendar year proposing to increase revenues by $1.5 million. on july 3, 2014, the oklahoma corporation commission approved a joint stipulation by ngd and the intervening parties resulting in a rate increase of $0.3 million, which included an adjustment to amortize over five years $1.5 million of expense incurred within the 2013 test year. new rates went into effect on july 3, 2014.
arkansas government mandated expenditure surcharge rider (gmesr).  on may 1, 2014, ngd made a filing with the arkansas public service commission (apsc) requesting to increase revenue under its interim gmesr by an additional $1.8 million.  interim rates were implemented upon filing and are subject to refund pending a final order from the apsc.
mississippi rate regulation adjustment (rra). on may 1, 2014, ngd filed for a $4.1 million rra with an adjusted roe of 9.27%.  on august 5, 2014, the mississippi public service commission approved a joint stipulation for a revenue adjustment
60
of $2.8 million, which included an adjustment to amortize over three years $0.5 million of expense incurred with the 2013 test year. new rates went into effect in september 2014.
louisiana rate stabilization plan (rsp). ngd made its 2014 louisiana rsp filings with the louisiana public service commission on october 1, 2014. the north louisiana rider rsp filing shows a revenue deficiency of $4.0 million, compared to the authorized roe of 10.25%.  the south louisiana rider rsp filing shows a revenue deficiency of $2.3 million, compared to the authorized roe of 10.5%. ngd began billing the revised rates in december 2014 subject to refund. on november 19, 2014, ngd sought permission to amend the prior year's south louisiana rsp filing to use a more representative capital structure and to adjust the filing's equity banding mechanism. on december 2, 2014, ngd sought permission for similar amendments to the prior year's north louisiana rsp filings. the louisiana public service commission has yet to take action on either request.
minneapolis franchise. in 2014, ngd provided natural gas distribution services to approximately 124,000 customers in minneapolis, minnesota under a franchise that was due to expire at the end of the year. in october 2014, the minneapolis city council unanimously approved a ten-year franchise agreement with ngd, effective january 1, 2015. the agreement is renewable for two additional five-year terms upon mutual consent of the parties. also in october 2014, the minneapolis city council unanimously approved a newly formed clean energy partnership (cep) between the city, ngd and xcel energy.  the cep board includes the mayor, two council members, the city's coordinator and two senior officials from each of the utilities.  the board's work plan will include new ideas to support developing renewable energy, increasing residential and business use of energy-efficiency programs and reducing the city's energy use.  the new franchise agreement with ngd can be terminated by the city after five years if the city finds, through a city council vote, that ngd is not acting in good faith to support the city's clean energy goals.

___________________
(1)   based on the consolidated debt to capitalization covenant in our revolving credit facility and the revolving credit facility of each of centerpoint houston and cerc corp., we would have been permitted to utilize the full capacity of such revolving credit facilities, which aggregated $2.1 billion at december 31, 2014.
(2)   represents outstanding letters of credit of $6 million and outstanding commercial paper of $164 million.
(3)   represents outstanding letters of credit.
(4)   represents outstanding commercial paper.
our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility can be drawn at the london interbank offered rate (libor) plus 1.25% based on our current credit ratings. the revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant which limits our consolidated debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to an amount not to exceed 65% of our consolidated capitalization. the financial covenant limit will temporarily increase from 65% to 70% if centerpoint houston experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory and we certify to the administrative agent that centerpoint houston has incurred system restoration costs reasonably likely to exceed $100 million in a consecutive twelve-month period, all or part of which centerpoint houston intends to seek to recover through securitization financing. such temporary increase in the financial covenant would be in effect from the date we deliver our certification until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the securitization financing, (ii) the first anniversary of our certification or (iii) the revocation of such certification.
centerpoint houston's $300 million revolving credit facility can be drawn at libor plus 1.125% based on centerpoint houston's current credit ratings. the revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant which limits centerpoint houston's
61
consolidated debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to an amount not to exceed 65% of centerpoint houston's consolidated capitalization.
cerc corp.'s $600 million revolving credit facility can be drawn at libor plus 1.5% based on cerc corp.'s current credit ratings. the revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant which limits cerc's consolidated debt to an amount not to exceed 65% of cerc's consolidated capitalization.
borrowings under each of the three revolving credit facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. however, there is no requirement that the borrower make representations prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. borrowings under each of the revolving credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we consider customary. the revolving credit facilities also provide for customary fees, including commitment fees, administrative agent fees, fees in respect of letters of credit and other fees. in each of the three revolving credit facilities, the spread to libor and the commitment fees fluctuate based on the borrower's credit rating. the borrowers are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants in the three revolving credit facilities.
on september 9, 2014, our revolving credit facility and the revolving credit facilities of centerpoint houston and cerc corp. were amended to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the commitments under the credit facilities from september 9, 2018 to september 9, 2019. the amendments also reduced the swingline and letter of credit sub-facilities under each credit facility, with total commitments under each credit facility remaining unchanged.
our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility backstops our $1.0 billion commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2014, we had $191 million of outstanding commercial paper. cerc corp.'s $600 million revolving credit facility backstops its $600 million commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2014, cerc corp. had $341 million of outstanding commercial paper.
securities registered with the sec centerpoint energy, centerpoint houston and cerc corp. have filed a joint shelf registration statement with the sec registering indeterminate principal amounts of centerpoint houston's general mortgage bonds, cerc corp.'s senior debt securities and centerpoint energy's senior debt securities and junior subordinated debt securities and an indeterminate number of centerpoint energy's shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, as well as stock purchase contracts and equity units.
temporary investments as of february 17, 2015, we had no temporary investments.
money pool we have a money pool through which the holding company and participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. the net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under our revolving credit facility or the sale of our commercial paper.
impact on liquidity of a downgrade in credit ratings the interest on borrowings under our credit facilities is based on our credit rating. as of february 17, 2015, moody's investors service, inc. (moody's), standard & poor's ratings services (s&p), a division of the mcgraw-hill companies, and fitch, inc. (fitch) had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of centerpoint energy and certain subsidiaries:

(1)   a moody's rating outlook is an opinion regarding the likely direction of an issuer's rating over the medium term.
(2)   an s&amp;p rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term.
(3)   a fitch rating outlook indicates the direction a rating is likely to move over a one- to two-year period.
we cannot assure you that the ratings set forth above will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. we note that these credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies.
a decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility, centerpoint houston's $300 million revolving credit facility and cerc corp.'s $600 million revolving credit facility. if our credit ratings or those of centerpoint houston or cerc corp. had been downgraded one notch by each of the three principal credit rating agencies from the ratings that existed at december 31, 2014, the impact on the borrowing costs under the three revolving credit facilities would have been immaterial. a decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper market. additionally, a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of our natural gas distribution and energy services business segments.
cerc corp. and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas from one of their suppliers under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of $140 million based on cerc corp.'s s&p senior unsecured long-term debt rating of a-. under these agreements, cerc may need to provide collateral if the aggregate threshold is exceeded or if the s&p senior unsecured long-term debt rating is downgraded below bbb+.
centerpoint energy services, inc. (ces), a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp. operating in our  energy services business segment, provides natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern united states. in order to economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, ces uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry, including those pertaining to credit thresholds. typically, the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to ces. to the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to ces at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold, ces is not obligated to provide collateral. mark-to-market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by ces. as of december 31, 2014, the amount posted as collateral aggregated approximately $83 million. should the credit ratings of cerc corp. (as the credit support provider for ces) fall below certain levels, ces would be required to provide additional collateral up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit. we estimate that as of december 31, 2014, unsecured credit limits extended to ces by counterparties aggregated $308 million, and $1 million of such amount was utilized.
pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper's guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both moody's and s&p, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months' charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. if the credit ratings of cerc corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, cerc corp. might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as $160 million as of december 31, 2014. the amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels.
in september 1999, we issued zero-premium exchangeable subordinated notes due 2029 (zens) having an original principal amount of $1.0 billion of which $828 million remains outstanding at december 31, 2014. each zens note was originally exchangeable at the holder's option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95% of the market value of the reference shares of time warner inc. common stock (tw common) attributable to such note.  the number and identity of the reference shares attributable to each zens note are adjusted for certain corporate events. on june 6, 2014, time warner inc. spun off its ownership of time inc. by distributing one share of time inc. common stock (time common) for every eight shares of tw common held on the may 23, 2014 record date. as of december 31, 2014, the reference shares for each zens note consisted of 0.5 share of tw common, 0.125505 share of time warner cable inc. (twc) common stock (twc common), 0.045455 share of aol inc. common stock (aol common) and 0.0625 share of time common.  on february 13, 2014, twc announced that it had agreed to merge with comcast corporation (comcast). in the merger, each share of twc common would be exchanged for 2.875 shares of comcast common stock (comcast common). upon the closing of the merger (assuming
63
no change in the merger consideration), the reference shares for each zens note would include 0.360827 share of comcast common in place of the current 0.125505 share of twc common. if our creditworthiness were to drop such that zens note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the zens notes were to become illiquid, some zens note holders might decide to exchange their zens notes for cash. funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of tw common, twc common, aol common and time common that we own or from other sources. we own shares of tw common, twc common, aol common and time common equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the zens notes. zens note exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the zens notes and tw common, twc common, aol common and time common shares would typically cease when zens notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and tw common, twc common, aol common and time common shares are sold. the ultimate tax liability related to the zens notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year, and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the zens notes. if all zens notes had been exchanged for cash on december 31, 2014, deferred taxes of approximately $357 million would have been payable in 2014. if all the tw common, twc common, aol common and time common had been sold on december 31, 2014, capital gains taxes of approximately $278 million would have been payable in 2014.
cross defaults under our revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness for borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations (including guarantees) exceeding $75 million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default. in addition, three outstanding series of our senior notes, aggregating $750 million in principal amount as of december 31, 2014, provide that a payment default by us, cerc corp. or centerpoint houston in respect of, or an acceleration of, borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations (including guarantees), in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million, will cause a default. a default by centerpoint energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries' debt instruments or revolving credit facilities.
possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures from time to time, we consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. any determination to take action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. we may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to us at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions.
enable midstream partners certain of the entities contributed to enable by cerc corp. are obligated on approximately $363 million of indebtedness owed to a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp. that is scheduled to mature in 2017.
following its ipo in april 2014, enable is expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2875 per unit on its outstanding units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to its general partner and its affiliates (referred to as "available cash") within 45 days after the end of each quarter. on january 23, 2015, enable declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.30875 per unit on all of its outstanding common and subordinated units for the quarter ended december 31, 2014. accordingly, cerc corp. expects to receive a cash distribution of approximately $72 million from enable in the first quarter of 2015 to be made with respect to cerc corp.'s limited partner interest in enable for the fourth quarter of 2014.
dodd-frank swaps regulation we use derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, swaps and options to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices and weather on our operating results and cash flows. following enactment of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (dodd-frank) in july 2010, the commodity futures trading commission (cftc) has promulgated regulations to implement dodd-frank's changes to the commodity exchange act, including the definition of commodity-based swaps subject to those regulations.  the cftc regulations are intended to implement new reporting and record keeping requirements related to their swap transactions and a mandatory clearing and exchange-execution regime for various types, categories or classes of swaps, subject to certain exemptions, including the trade-option and end-user exemptions. although we anticipate that most, if not all, of our swap transactions should qualify for an exemption to the clearing and
64
exchange-execution requirements, we will still be subject to record keeping and reporting requirements. other changes to the commodity exchange act made as a result of dodd-frank and the cftc's implementing regulations could increase the cost of entering into new swaps.
collection of receivables from reps centerpoint houston's receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from reps that supply the electricity centerpoint houston distributes to their customers. adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for centerpoint houston's services or could cause them to delay such payments. centerpoint houston depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis, and any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect centerpoint houston's cash flows. in the event of a rep's default, centerpoint houston's tariff provides a number of remedies, including the option for centerpoint houston to request that the texas utility commission suspend or revoke the certification of the rep. applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments. however, centerpoint houston remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to the replacement rep or the provider of last resort. if a rep were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made against centerpoint houston involving payments it had received from such rep. if a rep were to file for bankruptcy, centerpoint houston may not be successful in recovering accrued receivables owed by such rep that are unpaid as of the date the rep filed for bankruptcy. however, texas utility commission regulations authorize utilities, such as cehe, to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by reps for recovery in future rate cases, subject to a review of reasonableness and necessity.
other factors that could affect cash requirements in addition to the above factors, our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by:
•   cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including our weather hedging arrangements, and gas purchases, gas price and gas storage activities of our natural gas distribution and energy services business segments;
•   acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts, under certain circumstances, as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers;
•   increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas;
•   increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities;

critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. additionally, different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors.
accounting for rate regulation accounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. our electric transmission & distribution business segment and our natural gas distribution business segment apply this accounting guidance. certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers.  regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates.  determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals.  if events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable, we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities.  at december 31, 2014, we had recorded regulatory assets of $3.5 billion and regulatory liabilities of $1.2 billion.
impairment of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, goodwill and equity method investments we review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, goodwill and equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets. a loss in value of an equity method investment is recognized when the decline is deemed to be other than temporary.  unforeseen events and changes in market conditions could have a material effect on the value of long-lived assets, including intangibles, goodwill and equity method investments due to changes in estimates of future cash flows, interest rate and regulatory matters and could result in an impairment charge. we recorded goodwill impairment of $-0- during 2014 and 2013, and $252 million during 2012. we did not record material impairments to long-lived assets, including intangibles, or equity method investments during 2014, 2013, and 2012.

we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of 2014 and determined, based on the results of the first step, using the income approach, no impairment charge was required for any reporting unit.  our reporting units approximate our reportable segments.
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques.
the determination of fair value requires significant assumptions by management which are subjective and forward-looking in nature. to assist in making these assumptions, we utilized a third-party valuation specialist in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the valuation of each of our reporting units. we based our assumptions on projected financial information that we believe is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. these projected cash flows factor in planned growth initiatives, and for our natural gas distribution reporting unit, the regulatory environment. the fair value of our natural gas distribution reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value. the fair value of our energy services reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately $50 million or approximately 14% excess fair value over the carrying value.
a key assumption in the income approach was the weighted average cost of capital of 5.5% and 5.9% applied in the valuation for natural gas distributions and energy services, respectively. an increase in the discount rate to greater than 6.5%, a decline in long-term growth rate from 3% to 2.3%, or a decrease in the aggregate cash flows of greater than 15% could have individually triggered a step-two goodwill impairment evaluation for our energy services reporting unit in 2014.
although there was not a goodwill asset impairment in our 2014 annual test, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if our market capitalization falls below book value for an extended period of time. no impairment triggers were identified subsequent to our 2014 annual test.
unbilled energy revenues revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. however, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month either electronically through ams meter communications or manual readings. at the end of each month, deliveries to non-ams customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. information regarding deliveries to ams customers after the last billing is obtained from actual ams meter usage data. unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on actual ams meter data, daily supply volumes and applicable rates. unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. as additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.
pension and other retirement plans we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. we use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. these factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. in addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded. please read "- other significant matters - pension plans" for further discussion.

other significant matters pension plans.  as discussed in note 6(b) to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (erisa) and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes.
under the terms of our pension plan, we reserve the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa.
the minimum funding requirements for the qualified pension plan were $87 million, $83 million and $73 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we made contributions of $87 million, $83 million and $73 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012 for the respective years. we expect to make contributions aggregating approximately $35 million in 2015.
additionally, we maintain an unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non-contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. employer contributions for the non-qualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled $10 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we expect to make contributions aggregating approximately $31 million in 2015.
changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. as such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants.
as the sponsor of a plan, we are required to (a) recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plan's over-funded status or as a liability such plan's under-funded status, (b) measure a plan's assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and regulatory assets.
the projected benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $2,403 million and $2,153 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the adoption of the new mortality table by the society of actuaries as of december 31, 2014 significantly contributed to the increase in the projected benefit obligation for the year.
as of december 31, 2014, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by $478 million. changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2015 could materially, positively or negatively, change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions.
pension cost was $77 million, $72 million and $82 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, of which $71 million, $64 million and $67 million impacted pre-tax earnings. included in the 2014 pension cost was $6 million related to the curtailment loss discussed below.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, centerpoint energy received notification from enable of its intent to provide employment offers to substantially all seconded employees. as a result, an additional pension cost of $6 million was recognized for the curtailment loss related to our pension plans. substantially all of the seconded employees became employees of enable effective january 1, 2015.
the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate.
as of december 31, 2014, our qualified pension plan had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.50%, which is a 0.50% decrease from the rate assumed as of december 31, 2013 due to the increase in the allocation to fixed income investments in our targeted asset allocation. the expected rate of return assumption was developed using the targeted asset allocation of our plans and the expected return for each asset class. we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets to reduce volatility and better match plan assets and liabilities.
as of december 31, 2014, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 4.05%, which is 0.75% lower than the 4.80% discount rate assumed in 2013. the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds
68
that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan.
pension cost for 2015, including the benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $80 million, of which we expect $55 million to impact pre-tax earnings, based on an expected return on plan assets of 6.50% and a discount rate of 4.05% as of december 31, 2014. if the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.50% from 6.50% to 6.00%, 2015 pension cost would increase by approximately $9 million.
as of december 31, 2014, the pension plan projected benefit obligation, including the unfunded benefit restoration plan, exceeded plan assets by $478 million.  if the discount rate were lowered by 0.50% from 4.05% to 3.55%, the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation by approximately $130 million and decrease our pension expense by approximately $3 million. the expected reduction in pension expense due to the decrease in discount rate is a result of the expected correlation between the reduced interest rate and appreciation of fixed income assets in pension plans with significantly more fixed income instruments than equity instruments. in addition, the assumption change would impact our consolidated balance sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of december 31, 2014 by $113 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2014 of $11 million, net of tax.
future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be.

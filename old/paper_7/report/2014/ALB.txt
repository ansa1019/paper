albemarle corporation and subsidiaries outlook on july 15, 2014, we entered into the merger agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of rockwood. on january 12, 2015, we completed the acquisition of rockwood for a purchase price of approximately $5.6 billion, comprised of approximately $3.6 billion in cash consideration and approximately $2.0 billion in equity consideration, with rockwood becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of albemarle. for additional information, see note 23, "acquisitions" to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report.
on january 20, 2015, we announced that as a result of the completion of the rockwood acquisition we will realign our organizational structure, to be effective by the end of the first quarter of 2015. at that time, the company's new reportable business segments will consist of three segments: performance chemicals, refining solutions and chemetall surface treatment. performance chemicals will combine our lithium, aluminum alkyls and derivative catalysts businesses with albemarle's existing performance chemicals segment. refining solutions will consist of the heavy oil upgrading and clean fuels technologies businesses, delivering a robust portfolio of catalyst solutions that apply to the entire refinery process. chemetall surface treatment will supply specialty chemicals with a focus on processes for the surface treatment of metals and plastics. each segment will have a dedicated team of sales, r&d, process engineering, manufacturing and sourcing, and business strategy personnel and will have full accountability for improving execution through greater asset and market focus, agility and responsiveness. additionally, in 2015 we intend to pursue strategic alternatives, including divestitures, related to certain product lines including flame retardants, specialty chemicals, fine chemistry services and metal sulfides. these businesses will not be included in the aforementioned segments.
the current business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve, from a slow and uneven global economic recovery, significantly lower crude oil prices, pricing pressure on bromine derivatives and an ever-changing landscape in electronics, to the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers, a volatile currency exchange landscape, and increasingly stringent environmental standards. amidst these dynamics, our business fundamentals are sound and we are strategically well-positioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes, optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio through pricing and product development, managing costs and delivering value to our customers. we believe that our businesses remain positioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and long-term trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to improved economic conditions.
through 2014, our operations were managed and reported as two operating segments: performance chemicals and catalyst solutions. financial results and discussion about our operating segments included in this annual report on form 10-k are categorized according to these two operating segments except where noted.
performance chemicals: we expect 2015 sales performance to be comparable overall to the prior year, as we manage through an uncertain environment characterized by soft demand in certain products and applications and cautious inventory management by our customers, along with the uncertain impacts of much weaker oil prices and a much stronger u.s. dollar, particularly as compared to the european union euro and the japanese yen. we believe we can sustain healthy margins with continued focus on maximizing our bromine franchise value.
we believe that the combination of solid, long-term business fundamentals, with our strong cost position, product innovations and effective management of raw material inventory inflation will enable us to manage our business through end market challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that will come with favorable market trends in select end markets and with a more evenly sustained economic recovery. our view of third party market indicators and order book trends makes us cautiously optimistic that volume trends for brominated flame retardants have stabilized and that demand for bromine in other applications aside from drilling completion fluids will continue to increase at a rate consistent with overall economic demand.
on a long-term basis, we continue to believe that improving global standards of living, widespread digitization, increasing demand for data management capacity and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety products. demand for drilling completion fluids in 2015 may be impacted negatively as a result of sharply lower oil prices impacting offshore drilling projects around the world. clear completion fluids shipment rates slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2014, consistent with this view. longer term, absent an increase in regulatory pressure on offshore drilling, we would expect this business to resume the solid growth trajectory of recent years once oil prices return to prices seen through most of 2014 as we expect that deep water drilling will continue to increase around the world. we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets. we believe the global supply/demand gap will tighten as demand for existing and possible new uses of bromine expand over time.
32
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries catalyst solutions: 2014 was a solid year for this business segment, with sales up 9% and profits up 15% on a combination of favorable volumes, price and product mix, especially in our refinery catalyst solutions product lines. our performance catalyst solutions business lines stabilized in 2014, driven by growth in our downstream catalysts business and demand growth in our organometallics product lines as polyolefins demand continued to grow at a 4-5% rate. we expect continued growth in our refinery catalyst solutions business, despite some concerns about how the price of oil will impact the crude slate used by refineries and the resulting demand for catalysts, and some expected product mix impact that is a result of timing of catalysts replacements in fixed bed units. we also expect 2015 to bring increasing stabilization and improvement in our catalysts for polyolefins, consistent with overall demand.
on a longer term basis, we believe increased global demand for petroleum products and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements will drive growth in our refinery catalyst solutions business. in addition, we expect growth in our performance catalyst solutions division to come from growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending, particularly in asia and the middle east.
delivering superior end-use performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry, and our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world, those managing new contaminants present in north america tight oil, and those in the middle east and asia seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields. while lower oil prices may impact the overall crude slate for a period of time, longer term, we believe that the global crude supply will get heavier and more sour, trends that bode well for catalysts demand. given this and based on our technology, current production capacities and expected growth in end market demand, we remain well-positioned for the future.
corporate and other: we continue to focus on cash generation, working capital management and process efficiencies. we expect our global effective tax rate for 2015 to be approximately 25.0%; however, our rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the u.s. and other tax jurisdictions.
actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and opeb plan obligations are reflected in corporate and other as a component of non-operating pension and opeb plan costs under mark-to-market accounting. results for the year ended december 31, 2014 include an actuarial loss of $130.8 million ($83.3 million after income taxes), as compared to a gain of $139.0 million ($88.3 million after income taxes) for the year ended december 31, 2013.
in the first quarter of 2014, we increased our quarterly dividend payout to $0.275 per share. we also repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock during 2014 for $150 million under our existing share repurchase program, and we may periodically repurchase shares in the future on an opportunistic basis. in the first quarter of 2015, we increased our quarterly dividend rate to $0.29 per share.
we remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions or other business development activities that will complement our business footprint. additional information regarding our products, markets and financial performance is provided at our web site, www.albemarle.com. our web site is not a part of this document nor is it incorporated herein by reference.

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries comparison of 2014 to 2013
net sales for the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded net sales of $2.45 billion, a 2% increase compared to net sales of $2.39 billion for the corresponding period of 2013. this increase was due primarily to favorable volume impacts of 2%, including favorable volume impacts of approximately $85.0 million in catalyst solutions and unfavorable volume impacts of approximately $33.0 million in performance chemicals, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts of approximately $2.2 million due to a stronger u.s. dollar as we closed out the year.
gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2014, our gross profit decreased $79.6 million, or 9%, from the corresponding 2013 period. our gross profit for 2014 was impacted by approximately $36.5 million of pension and opeb costs (including mark-to-market actuarial losses of $36.4 million) allocated to cost of goods sold, as compared to $42.2 million of pension and opeb benefits (including mark-to-market actuarial gains of $42.7 million) allocated to cost of goods sold in 2013. overall, these factors contributed to our gross profit margin of 31.5% for the current year, down from 35.5% in 2013. excluding the impact of pension and opeb mark-to-market actuarial losses and gains, our gross profit margin was 33.0% in 2014 and 33.7% in 2013.
the mark-to-market actuarial loss in 2014 is primarily attributable to: (a) a decrease in the weighted-average discount rate for our pension plans to 4.03% from 5.00% to reflect market conditions as of the december 31, 2014 measurement date, and (b) changes in mortality assumptions, and to a lesser extent, other demographic assumptions related to our pension plans. the mark-to-market actuarial loss in 2014 was partially offset by a higher return on pension plan assets in 2014 than was expected, as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance. the actual return on u.s. pension plan assets was 8.87% versus an expected return of 6.91%.
the mark-to-market actuarial gain in 2013 is primarily attributable to: (a) an increase in the weighted-average discount rate for our pension plans to 5.00% from 4.04% to reflect market conditions as of the december 31, 2013 measurement date; (b) the actual return on u.s. pension plan assets of 15.07% was higher than the expected return of 7.25% as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance; and (c) changes in demographic assumptions related to our pension plans, such as mortality rates, rates of compensation and other factors.
selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014, our selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses increased $196.9 million, or 125%, compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily due to unfavorable pension and opeb items and incentive compensation costs. sg&a expenses for 2014 includes approximately $97.1 million of pension and opeb costs (including mark-to-market actuarial losses of $94.5 million), as compared to $90.5 million of pension and opeb benefits (including mark-to-market actuarial gains of $96.3 million) in 2013. the mark-to-market actuarial losses and gains in 2014 and 2013, respectively, resulted from the factors as discussed in gross profit above.
as a percentage of net sales, sg&a expenses were 14.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to 6.6% for the corresponding period in 2013. excluding the impact of pension and opeb mark-to-market actuarial losses and gains, sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.7% in 2014 and 10.6% in 2013.
research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014, our r&d expenses increased $6.1 million, or 7%, from the year ended december 31, 2013, mainly as a result of higher personnel costs and higher spending for outside services. as a percentage of net sales, r&d expenses were 3.6% in 2014, compared to 3.4% in 2013.
restructuring and other charges, net restructuring and other charges, net, of $25.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 includes the following items:
(a)   estimated costs of approximately $20.5 million ($13.6 million after income taxes) in connection with action we initiated to reduce the high cost supply capacity of certain aluminum alkyl products, primarily through the termination of a third party manufacturing contract.
(b)   an impairment charge of $3.0 million ($1.9 million after income taxes) for certain capital project costs also related to aluminum alkyls capacity which we do not expect to recover.

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries
(c)   other net charges of $2.4 million ($1.4 million after income taxes), mainly in connection with a write-off of certain multi-product facility project costs that we do not expect to recover in future periods.
in connection with the announced realignment of our operating segments effective january 1, 2014, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we initiated a workforce reduction plan which resulted in a reduction of approximately 230 employees worldwide. we recorded charges of $33.4 million ($21.9 million after income taxes) during the year ended december 31, 2013 for termination benefits and other costs related to this workforce reduction plan.
acquisition and integration related costs the year ended december 31, 2014 includes $23.6 million of acquisition and integration related costs in connection with the acquisition of rockwood and $6.6 million of acquisition-related costs in connection with other significant projects. acquisition-related costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2013 are included in sg&a expenses and were not significant.
interest and financing expenses interest and financing expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased $9.8 million to $41.4 million from the corresponding 2013 period, due mainly to higher borrowing levels in connection with the acquisition of rockwood and decreases in interest capitalized on lower average construction work in progress balances in the 2014 period.
other expenses, net other expenses, net, for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $16.8 million versus $6.7 million for the corresponding 2013 period. this increase was due to $16.7 million of amortized bridge facility fees and $1.0 million of other financing fees in the 2014 period related to the acquisition of rockwood, partially offset by net favorable items of $7.6 million primarily related to favorable currency impacts compared to the corresponding period in 2013 due to more effective management of currency risks.
income tax expense the effective income tax rate for 2014 was 8.7% compared to 25.0% for 2013. our effective income tax rate differs from the u.s. federal statutory income tax rates in the comparative periods mainly due to the impact of earnings from outside the u.s. in 2014, acquisition and integration related costs and pension-related mark-to-market actuarial losses contributed to a decrease in pre-tax income year over year, which caused the impact of earnings outside the u.s. to have a much larger impact versus the prior year. see note 19, "income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate to our effective rate for 2014 and 2013.
equity in net income of unconsolidated investments equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was $35.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $31.7 million in the same period last year. this increase was due primarily to higher equity income reported by our catalyst solutions segment joint ventures nippon ketjen company limited, stannica llc and fábrica carioca de catalisadores sa, and our performance chemicals segment joint venture magnifin, partly offset by lower equity income amounts reported by our catalyst solutions segment joint ventures saudi organometallic chemicals company and eurecat.
(loss) income from discontinued operations on september 1, 2014, we closed the sale of our antioxidant, ibuprofen and propofol businesses and assets to si group, inc. the financial results of the disposed group have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. (loss) income from discontinued operations, after income taxes, was $(69.5) million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $4.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. included in the 2014 period is a pre-tax charge of $(85.5) million ($65.7 million after income taxes) representing the difference between the carrying value of the related assets and their fair value as determined by the sales price less estimated costs to sell. the loss is primarily attributable to the write-off of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, net of cumulative foreign currency translation gains of $17.8 million.
36
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2014, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $27.6 million compared to $26.7 million in the same period last year. this increase of $0.9 million was due primarily to higher profits of our consolidated joint venture jbc in the 2014 period.
net income attributable to albemarle corporation net income attributable to albemarle corporation decreased to $133.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $413.2 million for the corresponding period of 2013, primarily due to an unfavorable impact of $73.6 million (after income taxes) related to discontinued operations, unfavorable impacts of $266.4 million related to pension and opeb items mainly resulting from an actuarial loss in 2014 compared to an actuarial gain in 2013, charges of $30.2 million in 2014 for certain significant acquisition-related costs (of which $23.6 million relates to the acquisition of rockwood), higher manufacturing and sg&a costs of approximately $33.0 million, higher interest and financing expenses of $9.8 million, and higher other expenses, net, of 10.1 million, partly offset by lower income tax expense of $116.0 million, lower restructuring and other charges, net, of $7.4 million, favorable volume impacts of approximately $12.2 million on market demand, and lower variable input costs of approximately $9.3 million.
other comprehensive (loss) income total other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax, was $(178.7) million in 2014 compared to $31.3 million in 2013. the majority of these amounts are the result of translating our foreign subsidiary financial statements from their local currencies to u.s. dollars. in 2014, other comprehensive (loss), net of tax, from foreign currency translation adjustments was $(168.8) million, mainly as a result of unfavorable movements of approximately $(124) million in the european union euro, $(18) million in the chinese renminbi and $(13) million in the brazilian real. also included in total other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax, for 2014 is $(21.0) million related to a realized loss on our interest rate swap which was settled in the fourth quarter, and $11.4 million in connection with the revaluation of our €700.0 million senior notes and settlement of related foreign currency forward contracts, both of which were designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations. in 2013, other comprehensive income, net of tax, from foreign currency translation adjustments was $31.7 million, mainly as a result of favorable movements in the european union euro of approximately $42 million, partially offset by unfavorable movements in the brazilian real of approximately $14 million.

performance chemicals performance chemicals segment net sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 were $1.35 billion, down $41.1 million, or 3%, in comparison to the same period in 2013. the decrease was driven mainly by unfavorable volume impacts on market demand of approximately 3%, mainly in fine chemistry services and specialty chemicals, and unfavorable pricing impacts of approximately 1% mainly in fire safety solutions. segment income for performance chemicals was down 9%, or $27.4 million, to $289.1 million for the year ended 2014 compared to 2013, as a result of higher manufacturing and sg&a spending of approximately $12.9 million, approximately $7.9 million in unfavorable pricing mainly in fire safety solutions, and unfavorable volume impacts of approximately $5.2 million on market demand mainly in fine chemistry services and specialty chemicals.
catalyst solutions catalyst solutions segment net sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 were $1.1 billion, an increase of $92.3 million, or 9%, compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was due mainly to favorable volumes of 9% on market demand across all product families, favorable pricing of 1% due to market conditions (driven by refinery catalyst solutions, partly offset by unfavorable pricing in performance catalyst solutions), and unfavorable currency impacts of approximately $1.6 million due to a stronger u.s. dollar. catalyst solutions segment income increased 15%, or $32.9 million, to $250.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 in comparison to the corresponding period of 2013. this increase was due primarily to approximately $17.2 million favorable volume impacts on stronger market demand across all businesses, lower variable input costs of approximately $8.2 million, favorable performance from our unconsolidated joint ventures, mainly nippon ketjen company limited, stannica llc and fábrica carioca de catalisadores sa, and favorable pricing of approximately $8.4 million mainly in refinery catalyst solutions due to market conditions. these were partly offset by approximately $12.0 million in unfavorable spending due mainly to higher personnel costs and higher maintenance and repairs at our manufacturing facilities, including startup of the heavy oil upgrading capacity expansion in bayport.
corporate and other for the year ended december 31, 2014, corporate and other expense was $203.6 million compared to corporate and other income of $81.4 million for the corresponding period in 2013. this unfavorable variance was primarily due to
39
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries unfavorable pension and opeb plan impacts of approximately $270 million, and unfavorable incentive compensation costs. corporate and other expense for 2014 includes $127.2 million of pension and opeb costs (including mark-to market actuarial losses) compared to $143.1 million of pension and opeb benefits in 2013.
comparison of 2013 to 2012
net sales for the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded net sales of $2.39 billion, a 5% decrease compared to net sales of $2.52 billion for the corresponding period of 2012. this decrease was due primarily to unfavorable pricing impacts of 7%, mainly lower metals surcharges in refinery catalyst solutions, lower overall price mix in catalyst solutions, lower regional pricing in specialty chemicals and lower pricing in fire safety solutions, partly offset by favorable volume impacts of 2%, driven by higher volumes in refinery catalyst solutions and fire safety solutions, net of lower volumes in fine chemistry services and the unfavorable volume impacts from our exit of the phosphorus flame retardants business in 2012.
gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2013, our gross profit decreased $48.4 million, or 5%, from the corresponding 2012 period due mainly to overall unfavorable pricing impacts, unfavorable currency impacts mainly from a weaker japanese yen, and higher manufacturing costs. these were partly offset by favorable impacts from lower variable input costs and favorable overall volumes. additionally, our gross profit for 2013 was impacted by approximately $42.2 million of pension and opeb benefits (including mark-to-market actuarial gains of $42.7 million) allocated to cost of goods sold, as compared to $26.3 million of pension and opeb costs (including mark-to-market actuarial losses of $25.9 million) allocated to cost of goods sold in 2012. pension and opeb costs included in cost of goods sold for 2012 include a correction of $3.5 million for actuarial gains that relate to 2011. overall, these factors contributed to our gross profit margin of 35.5% for 2013, down from 35.7% in 2012. excluding the impact of pension and opeb mark-to-market actuarial gains and losses, our gross profit margin was 33.7% in 2013 and 36.7% in 2012.
the mark-to-market actuarial gain in 2013 is primarily attributable to: (a) an increase in the weighted-average discount rate for our pension plans to 5.00% from 4.04% to reflect market conditions as of the december 31, 2013 measurement date; (b) the actual return on u.s. pension plan assets of 15.07% was higher than the expected return of 7.25% as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance; and (c) changes in demographic assumptions related to our pension plans, such as mortality rates, rates of compensation and other factors.
the mark-to-market actuarial loss in 2012 is primarily attributable to: (a) a decrease in the weighted-average discount rate for our pension plans to 4.04% from 5.04% to reflect market conditions as of the december 31, 2012 measurement date, and; (b) changes in demographic assumptions related to our pension plans, such as mortality rates, rates of compensation and other factors. the mark-to-market actuarial loss in 2012 was partially offset by a higher return on pension plan assets in 2012 than was expected, as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance. the actual return on u.s. pension plans assets was 11.90% versus an expected return of 8.25%.
selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2013, our sg&a expenses decreased $150.3 million, or 49%, compared to the year ended december 31, 2012. this decrease was primarily due to favorable pension and opeb items, lower personnel costs and lower sales commissions partly offset by higher expenses for services. sg&a expenses for 2013 includes approximately $90.5 million of pension and opeb benefits (including mark-to-market actuarial gains of $96.3 million), as compared to $51.1 million of pension and opeb costs (including mark-to-market actuarial losses of $49.8 million) in 2012. the mark-to-market actuarial gains and losses in 2013 and 2012, respectively, resulted from the factors as discussed in gross profit above. additionally, pension and opeb costs included in sg&a for 2012 include a correction of $6.8 million for actuarial gains that relate to 2011.
sg&a expenses for 2012 also include: (a) a gain of $8.1 million resulting from proceeds received in connection with the settlement of litigation (net of legal fees); and (b) an $8 million charitable contribution to the albemarle foundation, a non-profit organization that sponsors grants, health and social projects, educational initiatives, disaster relief, matching gift programs, scholarships and other charitable initiatives in locations where our employees live and operate.
as a percentage of net sales, sg&a expenses were 6.6% for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared to 12.2% for the corresponding period in 2012. excluding the impact of pension and opeb mark-to-market actuarial gains and losses, sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.6% in 2013 and 10.3% in 2012.
40
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2013, our r&d expenses increased $3.3 million, or 4%, from the year ended december 31, 2012, as a result of higher expenses for services. as a percentage of net sales, r&d expenses were 3.4% in 2013, compared to 3.1% in 2012.
restructuring and other charges, net in connection with the announced realignment of our operating segments effective january 1, 2014, in the fourth quarter of 2013 we initiated a workforce reduction plan which resulted in a reduction of approximately 230 employees worldwide. we recorded charges of $33.4 million ($21.9 million after income taxes) during the year ended december 31, 2013 for termination benefits and other costs related to this workforce reduction plan.
restructuring and other charges, net were $111.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2012 and included the following items:
(a)   net charges amounting to $100.8 million ($76.1 million after income taxes) in connection with our exit of the phosphorus flame retardants business. the charges are comprised mainly of non-cash items consisting of net asset write-offs of approximately $57 million and write-offs of foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately $12 million, as well as accruals for future cash costs associated with related severance programs of approximately $22 million, estimated site remediation costs of approximately $9 million, other estimated exit costs of approximately $3 million, partly offset by a gain of approximately $2 million related to the sale of our nanjing, china manufacturing site. we began to realize favorable profit impacts from this program in the fourth quarter of 2012.
(b)   a net curtailment gain of $4.5 million ($2.9 million after income taxes) and a one-time employer contribution to the company's defined contribution plan of $10.1 million ($6.4 million after income taxes), both in connection with various amendments to certain of our u.s. pension and defined contribution plans that were approved by our board of directors in the fourth quarter of 2012. these amendments provided for formula changes to the related defined contribution plans as well as special benefits for certain defined benefit plan participants which culminate in a freeze of pension benefits under the related qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plan after a two year transition period.
(c)   charges amounting to $5.3 million ($4.3 million after income taxes) related to changes in product sourcing and other items.
interest and financing expenses interest and financing expenses for the year ended december 31, 2013 decreased $1.2 million to $31.6 million from the corresponding 2012 period, due mainly to lower interest rates on variable-rate borrowings partially offset by higher levels of variable-rate debt in 2013.
other (expenses) income, net other (expenses) income, net, for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $(6.7) million versus $1.2 million for the corresponding 2012 period. this change was due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts compared to the corresponding period in 2012.
income tax expense the effective income tax rate for 2013 was 25.0% compared to 21.8% for 2012. our effective income tax rate differs from the u.s. federal statutory income tax rates in the comparative periods mainly due to the impact of earnings from outside the u.s. our effective income tax rate for the 2012 period was impacted by discrete net tax benefit items of $1.0 million related principally to tax planning and the release of various tax reserves for uncertain domestic tax positions due to the expiration of the domestic statute of limitations related to the 2008 tax year, as well as $100.8 million of pre-tax charges ($76.1 million after taxes) associated with our exit of the phosphorus flame retardants business. see note 19, "income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate to our effective rate for 2013 and 2012.

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries equity in net income of unconsolidated investments equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was $31.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $38.1 million in the same period last year. this decrease was due primarily to overall lower equity income amounts reported from our catalyst solutions segment joint ventures, including unfavorable currency translation impacts of $2.4 million due to a weaker japanese yen and brazilian real, partly offset by higher equity income amounts reported from our performance chemicals segment joint venture magnifin.
income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations, after income taxes, was $4.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, essentially unchanged from the year ended december 31, 2012. favorable sales volumes and lower variable input costs in these businesses was offset by higher spending and unfavorable pricing trends as compared to the prior year.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2013, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $26.7 million compared to $18.6 million in the same period last year. this increase of $8.1 million was due primarily to higher overall profits and a contractually-based reduction in our share of profits of $6.6 million in our joint venture in jordan.
net income attributable to albemarle corporation net income attributable to albemarle corporation increased to $413.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from $311.5 million for the corresponding period of 2012 primarily due to impacts from higher sales volumes of approximately $59.0 million, lower sg&a expenses (including favorable impacts from pension and opeb items) of approximately $44.0 million, lower restructuring and other charges of approximately $78.0 million, and favorable overall variable input costs of approximately $54.0 million. these impacts were partly offset by lower pricing impacts, including impacts from both volatility in metals surcharges and related cost impacts in refinery catalyst solutions (particularly rare earths) and in certain products in our bromine portfolio and fire safety solutions, unfavorable manufacturing costs of approximately $18.0 million (net of favorable impacts from pension and opeb items), lower equity in net income of unconsolidated investments, higher r&d expenses and unfavorable foreign currency impacts.
other comprehensive income total other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $31.3 million in 2013 compared to $24.8 million in 2012. the majority of these amounts are the result of translating our foreign subsidiary financial statements from their local currencies to u.s. dollars. in 2013, other comprehensive income, net of tax, from foreign currency translation adjustments was $31.7 million, mainly as a result of favorable movements in the european union euro of approximately $42 million, partially offset by unfavorable movements in the brazilian real of approximately $14 million. in 2012, other comprehensive income, net of tax, from foreign currency translation adjustments was $28.8 million, mainly as a result of favorable movements in the european union euro, british pound sterling and korean won of approximately $20 million, $12 million and $5 million, respectively, partially offset by unfavorable movements in the brazilian real of approximately $9 million.

(a)   excludes corporate noncontrolling interest adjustments of $(20) for the year ended december 31, 2012.
performance chemicals performance chemicals segment net sales for the year ended december 31, 2013 were $1.39 billion, down $58.6 million, or 4%, in comparison to the same period in 2012. the decrease was driven mainly by our mid-year 2012 exit of the phosphorus flame retardants business, an impact of $33.6 million, or 2%, and lower pricing due to market conditions of 4% mainly in fire safety solutions and specialty chemicals. other impacts included favorable volumes of 1% due to market demand, mainly in fire safety solutions and specialty chemicals partly offset by lower fine chemistry services volumes, and unfavorable currency impacts of approximately $5.0 million, mainly from the weaker japanese yen (partly offset by favorable impacts from the european union euro). segment income for performance chemicals was down 21%, or $81.7 million, to $316.5 million for the year ended 2013 compared to 2012, as a result of lower pricing due to market conditions of approximately $58.0 million, mainly in fire safety solutions and specialty chemicals, higher variable input costs of natural gas and certain raw materials of approximately $7.0 million, higher manufacturing and sg&a costs of approximately $27.0 million, and unfavorable currency impacts of approximately $7.5 million mainly due to the weaker japanese yen. also contributing to the decrease were delays in product launches in our fine chemistry services businesses and unfavorable volumes in our agricultural intermediates business due to market demand of approximately $4.0 million, and $8.1 million in higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests associated with a contractual reduction in our share of profits at our jordan joint venture. these were partly offset by favorable volume impacts of approximately $23.0 million from increased demand in fire safety solutions and favorable equity in net income from our unconsolidated investment in magnifin.
catalyst solutions catalyst solutions segment net sales for the year ended december 31, 2013 were $1.0 billion, a decrease of $66.3 million, or 6%, compared to the year ended december 31, 2012. this decrease was due mainly to unfavorable pricing on lower metals
44
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries surcharges in refinery catalyst solutions of approximately $100.0 million, and lower pricing and volumes in performance catalyst solutions of approximately $16.0 million due to the overall balance of demand and supply, partly offset by favorable volume impacts of approximately $43.0 million due to stronger market demand in refinery catalyst solutions. catalyst solutions segment income decreased 17%, or $45.1 million, to $217.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 in comparison to the corresponding period of 2012. this decrease was due primarily to net unfavorable pricing impacts of approximately $50.0 million, mainly from volatility in metals surcharges and related cost impacts in refinery catalyst solutions, unfavorable manufacturing costs of approximately $16.0 million, unfavorable currency impacts of approximately $6.0 million, mainly from the weaker japanese yen, and $6.4 million lower equity in net income of unconsolidated investments. these were partly offset by favorable volume impacts of approximately $31.0 million mainly in refinery catalysts solutions.
corporate and other for the year ended december 31, 2013, corporate and other income was $81.4 million compared to corporate and other expense of $129.6 million for the corresponding period in 2012. this improvement was primarily due to favorable pension and opeb plan impacts of approximately $211 million. corporate and other income for 2013 includes $143.1 million of pension and opeb benefits (including mark-to market actuarial gains) compared to $68.0 million of pension and opeb costs in 2012. pension and opeb costs included in corporate and other for 2012 include a correction of $10.3 million (comprised of $3.5 million in cost of goods sold and $6.8 million in sg&a) for actuarial gains that relate to 2011.
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates estimates, assumptions and reclassifications the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements.
certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
recovery of long-lived assets. we evaluate the recovery of our long-lived assets on a reporting unit basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment.
income taxes. we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings, and we estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets, uncertain tax positions, and indefinite investment assertions.
environmental remediation liabilities. we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on site-specific facts and circumstances. cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing (i) the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter, (ii) the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and (iii) the extent of other parties' share of responsibility.
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.
revenue recognition we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable, and has been earned, in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance. we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer, which usually occurs at the time shipment is made. significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis, and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements. our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale, order confirmation documents and invoices. we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed. we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts. where the company incurs pre-production design and development costs under long-term supply contracts, these costs are expensed where they relate to the products sold unless contractual guarantees for reimbursement exist. conversely, these costs are capitalized if they pertain to equipment that we will own and use in producing the products to be supplied and expect to utilize for future revenue generating activities.
45
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to not be amortized.
we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value. we estimate the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows. future cash flows include assumptions for sales volumes, selling prices, raw material prices, labor and other employee benefit costs, capital additions and other economic or market related factors. significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. we use a weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing. our wacc calculation incorporates industry-weighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective. the factors in this calculation are largely external to the company and, therefore, are beyond our control. we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts. the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october 31, 2014 and concluded there was no impairment as of that date.
definite-lived intangible assets, such as purchased technology, patents, customer lists and trade names, are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five to twenty-five years. we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance. see note 11, "goodwill and other intangibles" to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report.
pension plans and other postretirement benefits under authoritative accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. as required, we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension or opeb plans equal to the plan's funded status as of the measurement date. the primary assumptions are as follows:
•   discount rate-the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future.
•   expected return on plan assets-we project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets for these investments. these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently.
•   rate of compensation increase-for salary-related plans, we project employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement.
•   mortality assumptions-assumptions about life expectancy of plan participants are used in the measurement of related plan obligations.
actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year. the remaining components of pension and opeb plan expense, primarily service cost, interest cost and expected return on assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis. the market-related value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement.
during 2014, we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate and mortality scales. we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions.
in selecting the discount rates for the u.s. plans, we consider expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis. as a result, the company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments. for 2014, the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by milliman, which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate. we believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the december 31, 2014 measurement date.
in selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans, we relied on aon hewitt methods, including the aon hewitt top-quartile and a yield curve derived from fixed-income security yields. the yield curve is generally based on a universe containing aa-graded corporate bonds in the euro zone without special features or options, which could affect the duration. in some countries, the yield curve is based on local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect corporate bond risk. payments we expect to be made from our retirement plans are applied to the resulting yield curve. for each plan, the discount
46
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.
at december 31, 2014, the weighted-average discount rate was decreased for the pension plans from 5.00% to 4.03% and for the opeb plans from 5.03% to 4.15% to reflect market conditions as of the december 31, 2014 measurement date.
in estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocations of plan assets to these investments. for the years 2014 and 2013, the weighted-average expected rate of return on domestic pension plan assets was 6.91% and 7.25%, respectively. the weighted-average expected rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets is 6.89% effective january 1, 2015. the weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our opeb plans was 7.00% during 2014 and 2013. there has been no change to the assumed rate of return on opeb plan assets effective january 1, 2015. our u.s. defined benefit plan for non-represented employees was closed to new participants effective march 31, 2004 and benefit accruals were frozen effective december 31, 2014. we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for u.s. employees hired after march 31, 2004 which was expanded to include all non-represented employees effective january 1, 2013.
in projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. at december 31, 2014, the assumed weighted-average rate of compensation increase changed to 3.40% from 2.78% for the pension plans. the assumed weighted-average rate of compensation increase was 3.50% for the opeb plans at december 31, 2014 and 2013.
in october 2014, the society of actuaries published updated mortality tables which reflect increased life expectancy. we revised our mortality assumptions to incorporate the new set of mortality tables issued by the society of actuaries for purposes of measuring our u.s. pension and opeb obligations at december 31, 2014.
at december 31, 2014, the assumed rate of increase in the pre-65 and post-65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for u.s. retirees was zero as the employer-paid premium caps (pre-65 and post-65) were met starting january 1, 2013.
a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the accrued opeb liabilities, and the annual net periodic pension and opeb cost. the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions, primarily in the u.s. (in thousands):

of the $612.1 million total pension and postretirement assets at december 31, 2014, $80.7 million, or approximately 13%, are measured using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). gains or losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets. see note 18, "pension plans and other postretirement benefits" to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report.

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries income taxes we use the liability method for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not.
deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses, capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers. a valuation allowance, reducing deferred tax assets, is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character. although realization is not assured, we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized.
we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. once the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50% likely to be realized. interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. we are no longer subject to u.s. federal income tax audits by tax authorities for years prior to 2011 since the internal revenue service ("irs") has completed a review of our income tax returns through 2007 and our statute of limitations has expired for 2008 through 2010. in 2014, the irs commenced an audit of 2011 through 2012. we also are no longer subject to any u.s. state income tax audits prior to 2010.
with respect to jurisdictions outside the u.s., we are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2006. during 2014, the german tax authorities continued the audit of two of our german subsidiaries for 2006 through 2009 that began in 2011. additionally, we received notification from the korean tax authorities of an audit to commence in 2015 for years 2011 through 2013 for one of our korean subsidiaries. in january of 2015, we received notification from the belgium tax authorities of an audit for 2012 through 2013 of one of our belgium subsidiaries. during 2013, the chinese tax authorities completed an audit of one of our chinese subsidiaries for 2006 through 2010 that began in 2011. no significant tax was assessed as a result of the completed audits.
while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position. accordingly, additional provisions on federal and foreign tax-related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.
since the timing of resolutions and/or closure of tax audits are uncertain, it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months. our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions, relating to a number of issues, up to approximately $0.7 million as a result of closure of tax statutes.
we have designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as indefinitely invested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries. our foreign earnings are computed under u.s. federal tax earnings and profits ("e&p") principles. in general, to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these e&p amounts, deferred taxes have not been provided, as they are essentially permanent in duration. the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable. we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be indefinitely invested.
stock-based compensation expense the fair value of restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards with a service condition are determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant, and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black-scholes valuation model. the fair value of performance unit awards with a service and a market condition are estimated on the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation model. the fair value of these awards is determined after giving effect to estimated forfeitures. such value is recognized as expense over the service period, which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant. to the extent restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses.

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 ("sox 404") requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports on form 10-k. our independent registered public accounting firm, pricewaterhousecoopers llp, provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. in order to make our assertion, we are required to identify material financial and operational processes, document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls. see "management's report on internal control over financial reporting" in item 8.
we have a dedicated sox 404 team to facilitate ongoing internal control testing, provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff in their control processes and assist in the overall assessment of internal control over financial reporting. status and updates are provided to executive management and our audit and finance committee of our board of directors on an ongoing basis. we also retain accounting firms other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox 404.
our sox 404 effort involves many of our employees around the world, including participation by our business and functional groups. we view our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise-it provides us an opportunity to continually assess our financial control environment and make us a more effective company.
financial condition and liquidity overview the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments, funding working capital, acquisitions and repayment of debt. we also make contributions to our u.s. defined benefit pension plans, pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase shares of our common stock. historically, cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations, debt financing and equity issuances.
we are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory. we anticipate that cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities and long-term borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt service obligations, fund capital expenditures and other investing activities, fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
cash flow our cash and cash equivalents were $2.5 billion at december 31, 2014 as compared to $477.2 million at december 31, 2013. cash provided by operating activities was $492.6 million, $432.9 million and $488.8 million during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 versus 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and higher dividends received from unconsolidated investments in 2014, partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2013 versus 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit from our businesses due mainly to overall unfavorable pricing impacts, unfavorable currency impacts mainly from a weaker japanese yen, and higher manufacturing costs. these were partly offset by favorable impacts from lower variable input costs and favorable overall volumes. the unfavorable impact on cash flow due to lower gross profit was partly offset by lower contributions to our defined benefit pension and opeb plans in 2013. included in contributions for the year ended december 31, 2012 is a contribution of $14.1 million to our supplemental executive retirement plan ("serp") in connection with the retirement of our former ceo and executive chairman.
during 2014, cash on hand and cash provided by operations funded payments of $150.0 million for repurchases of our common stock, capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of $110.6 million, dividends to shareholders of $84.1 million, $33.4 million for the settlement of a forward starting interest rate swap, debt financing costs of $17.6 million and pension and postretirement contributions of $13.9 million. also during 2014, our consolidated joint venture, jbc, paid a dividend of approximately $51 million, which resulted in a dividend to noncontrolling interests of $15.5 million. additionally, in the third quarter of 2014 we closed the sale of our antioxidant, ibuprofen and propofol businesses and assets for net proceeds of $104.7 million and a receivable of $7.6 million, which was collected in the first quarter of 2015. in the fourth quarter of 2014 we issued a series of new senior notes totaling approximately $1.9 billion, as further described in long-term debt below. during 2013, proceeds from borrowings net of repayments, cash on hand and cash provided by operations funded payments of $582.3 million for repurchases of our common stock, capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of $155.3
49
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries million, dividends to shareholders of $78.1 million and pension and postretirement contributions of $13.3 million. also during 2013, our consolidated joint venture, jbc, paid a dividend of approximately $38 million, which resulted in a dividend to noncontrolling interests of $10.0 million. in 2012, cash on hand and cash from operations funded capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment of $280.9 million, advances to joint ventures of $25.0 million, repayments of debt, net of borrowings, of $63.8 million, repurchases of shares of our common stock of $63.6 million, dividends to shareholders of $69.1 million and $9.1 million in withholding taxes paid on stock-based compensation amounts distributed during the period.
net current assets increased to approximately $2.21 billion at december 31, 2014 from $1.05 billion at december 31, 2013. the increase in net current assets was due primarily to higher cash on hand at december 31, 2014 in connection with the issuance of new senior notes in 2014, partially offset by the reclassification of our commercial paper notes and 5.10% senior notes from long-term debt to current portion of long-term debt in 2014. other changes in the components of net current assets are due to the timing of the sale of goods and other normal transactions leading up to the balance sheet dates and are not the result of any policy changes by the company, nor do they reflect any change in either the quality of our net current assets or our expectation of success in converting net working capital to cash in the normal course of business.
capital expenditures were $110.6 million, $155.3 million and $280.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and were incurred mainly for plant machinery and equipment. we expect our capital expenditures to approximate $235 million in 2015 for capacity increases, cost reduction and continuity of operations projects.
we made contributions to our defined benefit pension and opeb plans of $13.9 million, $13.3 million and $21.6 million during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. included in contributions for the year ended december 31, 2012 is a contribution of $14.1 million to our serp in connection with the retirement of our former ceo and executive chairman.
on february 12, 2013, our board of directors authorized an increase in the number of shares the company is permitted to repurchase under its existing share repurchase program to 15 million from 3.9 million shares that remained outstanding under the program as of december 31, 2012. during 2014, 2013 and 2012 we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares, 9.2 million shares and 1.1 million shares of our common stock, respectively, pursuant to the terms of our board authorized share repurchase program. all of the shares repurchased in 2014 and approximately 7.1 million of the shares repurchased in 2013 were also repurchased pursuant to the terms of accelerated share repurchase agreements with major financial institutions. as of december 31, 2014, we had no accelerated share repurchase agreements outstanding.
on february 24, 2015, we increased our quarterly dividend rate to $0.29 per share, a 5% increase from the quarterly rate of $0.275 per share paid in 2014.
during 2014, we initiated action to reduce high cost supply capacity of certain aluminum alkyl products, primarily through the termination of a third party manufacturing contract. based on the contract termination, we estimated costs of approximately $20.5 million for contract termination and volume commitments. additionally, we have recorded an impairment charge of $3.0 million for certain capital project costs also related to aluminum alkyls capacity which we do not expect to recover. after income taxes, these charges were approximately $15.5 million. we expect to realize annual savings of up to $3 million as a result of this capacity reduction, beginning within the next two years.
also during 2014, we incurred $23.6 million of acquisition and integration related costs in connection with the acquisition of rockwood and $6.6 million of acquisition-related costs in connection with other significant projects. we currently anticipate incurring additional acquisition and integration related costs of approximately $200 million over the next two years in connection with the acquisition of rockwood; actual results may differ from this estimate.
on february 19, 2015, verition multi-strategy master fund ltd and verition partners master fund ltd, who collectively owned approximately 882,000 shares of rockwood common stock immediately prior to the merger, commenced an action in the delaware chancery court seeking appraisal of their shares of rockwood stock pursuant to delaware general corporation law § 262. these shareholders exercised their right not to receive the merger consideration which was comprised of (i) $50.65 in cash, without interest, and (ii) 0.4803 of a share of albemarle common stock, for each share of rockwood common stock owned by such shareholders. following the merger, these shareholders ceased to have any rights with respect to their rockwood shares, except for their rights to seek an appraisal of the cash value of their rockwood shares under delaware law. while albemarle intends to vigorously defend against this action, the outcome of the appraisal process cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time.
in connection with the announced realignment of our operating segments effective january 1, 2014, in the fourth quarter of 2013 we initiated a workforce reduction plan which resulted in a reduction of approximately 230 employees worldwide. in the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded charges of $33.4 million ($21.9 million after income taxes) for termination benefits and
50
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries other costs related to this workforce reduction plan. payments under this workforce reduction plan were substantially completed in 2014.
in 2012, we recorded net charges amounting to $100.8 million ($76.1 million after income taxes) in connection with our exit of the phosphorus flame retardants business. we began to realize favorable profit impacts from this program in the fourth quarter of 2012.
at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents included $558.7 million and $388.3 million, respectively, held by our foreign subsidiaries. the majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely invested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the u.s. through funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions, research, operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations. from time to time, we repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries to the u.s. for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends, but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be indefinitely invested or whose earnings qualify as "previously taxed income" as defined by the internal revenue code. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we repatriated approximately $10.0 million, $7.2 million and $70.6 million in cash, respectively, as part of these foreign cash repatriation activities. in late december 2014, albemarle commenced the implementation of its plans to access internal cash from albemarle, rockwood and their respective subsidiaries to help fund the merger. the structure implemented did not impact the indefinite investment assertion of albemarle as no taxes were triggered in the movements of albemarle's cash.
while we continue to closely monitor our cash generation, working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy, we are optimistic that we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives. additionally, we anticipate that future capital spending including business acquisitions, share repurchases and other cash outlays should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations and cash on hand, with additional cash needed, if any, provided by borrowings. the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements.
long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2014, we issued a series of senior notes (collectively, the "2014 senior notes") as follows:
•   €700.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, issued on december 8, 2014, bearing interest at a rate of 1.875% payable annually on december 8 of each year, beginning in 2015. these senior notes mature on december 8, 2021.
•   $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, issued on november 24, 2014, bearing interest at a rate of 3.00% payable semi-annually on june 1 and december 1 of each year, beginning june 1, 2015. these senior notes mature on december 1, 2019.
•   $425.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, issued on november 24, 2014, bearing interest at a rate of 4.15% payable semi-annually on june 1 and december 1 of each year, beginning june 1, 2015. these senior notes mature on december 1, 2024.
•   $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, issued on november 24, 2014, bearing interest at a rate of 5.45% payable semi-annually on june 1 and december 1 of each year, beginning june 1, 2015. these senior notes mature on december 1, 2044.
we also have outstanding $350.0 million of 4.50% senior notes due in 2020.
our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding. the senior notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries. as is customary for such long-term debt instruments, each senior note outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before their maturity, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis using the comparable government rate (as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes) plus between 25 and 40 basis points, depending on the note, plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption. holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101% upon a change of control triggering event, as defined in the indentures. the senior notes are subject to typical events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events, nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness of $40 million or more caused by a nonpayment default.
51
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries our $325.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, issued on january 20, 2005 and bearing interest at a rate of 5.10%, matured and were repaid on february 1, 2015. as a result of the refinancing of these senior notes prior to december 31, 2014, these senior notes were included in current portion of long-term debt at december 31, 2014.
in anticipation of refinancing our 5.10% senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2014, on january 22, 2014, we entered into a pay fixed, receive variable rate forward starting interest rate swap with j.p. morgan chase bank, n.a., to be effective october 15, 2014. our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking this hedge was to eliminate the variability in the interest rate and partial credit spread on the 20 future semi-annual coupon payments that we will pay in connection with our 4.15% senior notes. the notional amount of the swap was $325.0 million and the fixed rate was 3.281%, with the cash settlement determined by reference to the changes in the u.s. dollar 3-month libor and credit spreads from the date we entered into the swap until the date the swap was settled (october 15, 2014). this derivative financial instrument was designated accounted for as a cash flow hedge under accounting standards codification ("asc") 815, derivatives and hedging. we determined there was no ineffectiveness during the term of the swap. on october 15, 2014, the swap was settled, resulting in a payment to the counterparty of $33.4 million. this amount was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income and is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 4.15% senior notes.
on february 7, 2014, we entered into a new $750.0 million credit facility. the five-year, revolving, unsecured credit agreement (hereinafter referred to as the february 2014 credit agreement) matures on february 7, 2019 and replaced our previous $750.0 million amended and restated credit agreement dated as of september 22, 2011. borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on the libor for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0.900% to 1.500%, depending on the company's credit rating from s&p and moody's. the applicable margin on the facility was 1.300% as of december 31, 2014.
borrowings under the february 2014 credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following covenants: (a) consolidated funded debt, as defined in the agreement, must be less than or equal to 3.50 times consolidated ebitda, as defined in the agreement, (which reflects adjustments for certain non-recurring or unusual items such as restructuring charges, facility divestiture charges and other significant non-recurring items), or herein "consolidated adjusted ebitda," as of the end of any fiscal quarter; (b) with the exception of certain liens as specified in the agreement, liens may not attach to assets when the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens plus unsecured subsidiary indebtedness, other than indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries under the february 2014 credit agreement, would exceed 20% of consolidated net worth, as defined in the agreement; and (c) with the exception of certain indebtedness as specified in the agreement, subsidiary indebtedness may not exceed the difference between 20% of consolidated net worth, as defined in the agreement, and indebtedness secured by liens permitted under the agreement.
on august 15, 2014, certain amendments were made to the february 2014 credit agreement which include the following: (a) an increase in the maximum leverage ratio (as described above) from 3.50 to 4.50 for the first four quarters following the completion of the acquisition of rockwood, stepping down by 0.25 on a quarterly basis thereafter until reaching 3.50; (b) modification of the indebtedness covenant to permit the incurrence of indebtedness represented by rockwood's former senior notes due in 2020; and (c) requiring subsidiaries of albemarle that guarantee rockwood's former senior notes or that guarantee the 2014 senior notes to also guarantee the february 2014 credit agreement.
on december 22, 2014, the february 2014 credit agreement was further amended to provide for, among other things, an increase in the aggregate commitments under the facility to $1.0 billion. as of december 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the february 2014 credit agreement.
on may 29, 2013, we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the "commercial paper notes") from time-to-time up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of $750.0 million. the proceeds from the issuance of the commercial paper notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of other debt of the company. our february 2014 credit agreement is available to repay the commercial paper notes, if necessary. aggregate borrowings outstanding under the february 2014 credit agreement and the commercial paper notes will not exceed the $1.0 billion current maximum amount available under the february 2014 credit agreement. the commercial paper notes will be sold at a discount from par, or alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance. the maturities of the commercial paper notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. the definitive documents relating to the commercial paper program contain customary representations, warranties, default and indemnification provisions. at december 31, 2014, we had $367.2 million of commercial paper notes outstanding bearing a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 0.79% and a weighted-average maturity of 25 days. in order to maintain flexibility with regard to our liquidity strategy, in the second quarter of 2014 the commercial paper notes were reclassified from long-term debt to current portion of long-term debt.
52
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries on august 15, 2014, we entered into a term loan credit agreement (the "term loan") providing for a tranche of senior unsecured term loans in an aggregate amount of $1.0 billion. amounts borrowed under the term loan were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the acquisition of rockwood and pay related fees and expenses. borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on an average libor for deposits in dollars plus an applicable margin which ranges from 1.125% to 2.000%, depending on our credit rating from s&p and moody's. as of december 31, 2014, the applicable margin over libor was 1.500%. term loan borrowings will be guaranteed by the subsidiaries of albemarle that guarantee rockwood's former senior notes or that guarantee the 2014 senior notes. the term loan matures 364 days following the date of funding, which occurred on january 12, 2015. borrowings are conditioned upon compliance with one financial covenant which requires that our maximum leverage ratio must be less than or equal to 4.50 times consolidated adjusted ebitda as of the end of any fiscal quarter. as of december 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the term loan.
on december 2, 2014, we entered into a new senior unsecured credit facility (the "cash bridge facility") pursuant to which the lenders thereunder provided for up to $1.15 billion in loans. the cash bridge facility is guaranteed by each of the company's subsidiaries that guarantee the february 2014 credit agreement. amounts borrowed under the cash bridge facility were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the acquisition of rockwood and pay related fees and expenses, and mature 60 days following the completion of rockwood acquisition. the interest rate on amounts outstanding will be either (a) libor, or (b) an alternate base rate (defined as the highest of (i) bank of america's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) a daily rate equal to one-month libor plus 1.00%), plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on our credit rating. structuring and underwriting fees of approximately $19.0 million were paid in 2014 in connection with the bridge facilities. as of december 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the cash bridge facility.
the non-current portion of our long-term debt amounted to $2.2 billion at december 31, 2014, compared to $1.1 billion at december 31, 2013. the increase is attributable to the issuance of the 2014 senior notes, partially offset by the reclassification of the commercial paper notes to current portion of long-term debt. in addition, at december 31, 2014, we had the ability to borrow $632.8 million under our commercial paper program and the february 2014 credit agreement, and $212.4 million under other existing lines of credit, subject to various financial covenants under our february 2014 credit agreement. we have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the february 2014 credit agreement, as applicable. therefore, the amounts outstanding under those credit lines, if any, are classified as long-term debt. we believe that as of december 31, 2014 we were, and currently are, in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
on january 12, 2015, we completed the acquisition of rockwood for a purchase price of approximately $5.6 billion, comprised of approximately $3.6 billion in cash consideration and approximately $2.0 billion in equity consideration, with rockwood becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of albemarle. the cash consideration was funded with proceeds from our 2014 senior notes and borrowings of $1.0 billion under the term loan, $800.0 million under the cash bridge facility and $250.0 million under the february 2014 credit agreement. in january 2015, the cash bridge facility was repaid in full and repayments totaling $816.5 million were made under the term loan. in february 2015, the remaining balance outstanding under the term loan was repaid in full, and amounts borrowed under the february 2014 credit agreement in connection with the acquisition ($250.0 million) were also repaid in full. such repayments were made with a combination of existing cash, cash acquired from rockwood, cash from operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program.
upon the completion of the rockwood acquisition, we assumed rockwood's 4.625% senior notes due 2020, which had an outstanding balance of approximately $1.2 billion at the date of closing.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, including bank guarantees and letters of credit, which totaled approximately $30.1 million at december 31, 2014. none of these off-balance sheet arrangements has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

(a)   amounts due in 2015 include short-term commercial paper borrowings and our 5.10% senior notes which matured and were repaid on february 1, 2015. on january 12, 2015, in connection with the completion of the acquisition of rockwood, we borrowed $1.0 billion under the term loan, $800.0 million under the cash bridge facility and $250.0 million under the february 2014 credit agreement, which are not included in the above table. in january 2015, the cash bridge facility was repaid in full and repayments totaling $816.5 million were made under the term loan. in february 2015, the remaining balance outstanding under the term loan was repaid in full, and amounts borrowed under the february 2014 credit agreement in connection with the acquisition ($250.0 million) were also repaid in full. such repayments were made with a combination of existing cash, cash acquired from rockwood, cash from operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program.
(b)   interest on our fixed rate borrowings was calculated based on the stated rates of such borrowings. a weighted average interest rate of 0.80% was used for our remaining long-term debt obligations.
(c)   these amounts primarily relate to contracts entered into with certain third party vendors in the normal course of business to secure raw materials for our production processes. in order to secure materials, sometimes for long durations, these contracts mandate a minimum amount of product to be purchased at predetermined rates over a set timeframe.
the contractual obligation at december 31, 2014 to purchase rockwood plus the assumption of rockwood's debt and other obligations has been omitted from the above table. the acquisition was completed on january 12, 2015.
amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions. contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans, including our serp, are expected to approximate $5 million in 2015. we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount. we made contributions of approximately $10.0 million to our domestic and foreign pension plans (both qualified and nonqualified) during the year ended december 31, 2014.
the liability related to uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, recorded in other noncurrent liabilities totaled $25.3 million and $29.8 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in other assets totaled $22.1 million and $25.7 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time.
liquidity outlook we anticipate that cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt service obligations, fund any capital expenditures and share repurchases, make pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future. with the acquisition of rockwood now being closed, our main focus over the next 18 to 24 months, in terms of uses of cash, will be deleveraging to restore our borrowings to more normal levels. however, as we have historically done, we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets, which may require additional liquidity.
while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions, an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments, decline funding under existing but uncommitted lines of credit, not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing. while the corporate bond and debt markets remain strong, volatility has increased in all capital markets over the past few years during times of uncertainty, such as european sovereign debt and u.s. budget concerns. if these concerns heighten, we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature. in addition, our cash flows from operations may be negatively

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability. when the u.s. federal reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to tighten the monetary supply in response, for example, to improving economic conditions, we may incur increased borrowing costs as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities, as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations.
overall, with generally strong cash-generative businesses and no significant long-term debt maturities before 2019, we believe we have and will maintain a solid liquidity position.
we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $2.5 billion as of december 31, 2014, of which $558.7 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. this cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in short-term investments including time deposits and readily marketable securities with relatively short maturities. with the exception of the cash that was used to (a) fund the cash portion of the merger consideration and (b) repay our 5.10% senior notes, substantially all of this cash is held, and intended for use, outside of the u.s. we anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the u.s. in excess of our cash held in the u.s. can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing u.s. credit facilities or our commercial paper program.
safety and environmental matters we are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements regulating the handling, manufacture and use of materials (some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies), the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment. to our knowledge, we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws, regulations, statutes and ordinances. compliance with existing federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position, but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results.
among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal superfund law, and similar state laws, under which we may be designated as a prp, and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites. management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a prp, our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis. further, almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated, studied and in many cases settled. in de minimis situations, our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement, enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp, except for remote contingencies. in other than de minimis prp matters, our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial. we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs. because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters, we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition.
our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were $35.7 million, $44.0 million and $39.0 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures, and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years. costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities, which at december 31, 2014 totaled approximately $9.2 million, a decrease of $7.4 million from $16.6 million at december 31, 2013. see note 16, "commitments and contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of our environmental liabilities for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis, although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period.
capital expenditures for pollution-abatement and safety projects, including such costs that are included in other projects, were approximately $15.2 million, $14.1 million and $25.4 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. in the future, capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals. management's estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution-abatement and safety regulations are subject to (a) the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and (b) uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful, or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary.

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries recently issued accounting pronouncements in february 2013, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting guidance that requires entities that have obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements and for which the total amount is fixed at the reporting date to measure such obligations as the sum of (a) the amount the entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors, and (b) any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. entities are also required to disclose the nature, amount and any other relevant information about such obligations. these amendments became effective on january 1, 2014 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in march 2013, the fasb issued accounting guidance that clarifies a parent company's accounting for the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment when the parent sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity. the guidance clarifies that the sale of an investment in a foreign entity includes both (a) events that result in the loss of a controlling financial interest in a foreign entity, and (b) events that result in an acquirer obtaining control of an acquiree in which it held an equity interest immediately before the acquisition date (sometimes also referred to as a step acquisition). accordingly, the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment should be released into net income upon the occurrence of those events. these amendments became effective on january 1, 2014 and had no impact on our accounting for the sale of our antioxidant, ibuprofen and propofol businesses and assets in 2014.
in july 2013, the fasb issued accounting guidance designed to reduce diversity in practice of financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. these new requirements became effective on january 1, 2014 and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
in april 2014, the fasb issued accounting guidance that changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements to provide users of financial statements with more information about the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of discontinued operations. the guidance modifies the definition of discontinued operations by limiting its scope to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. additionally, these new requirements require entities to disclose the pretax profit or loss related to disposals of significant components that do not qualify as discontinued operations. these new requirements become effective for public entities in annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014 and interim periods within those years. the impact of these new requirements is dependent on the nature of dispositions, if any, after adoption.
in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting guidance designed to enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. the core principle of the guidance is that revenue recognized from a transaction or event that arises from a contract with a customer should reflect the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services provided. to achieve that core principle the new guidance sets forth a five-step revenue recognition model that will need to be applied consistently to all contracts with customers, except those that are within the scope of other topics in the asc. also required are new disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. the new disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information about contracts with customers, significant judgments made in applying the revenue guidance, and assets recognized related to the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. these new requirements become effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and early adoption is prohibited. we are assessing the impact of these new requirements on our financial statements.
in june 2014, the fasb issued accounting guidance which clarifies the proper method of accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. the accounting guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. these new requirements become effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted. we do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements.
in february 2015, the fasb issued accounting guidance that changes the analysis that reporting entities must perform to determine whether certain types of legal entities should be consolidated. specifically, the amendments affect (a) limited partnerships and similar legal entities; (b) the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with variable interest entities, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships; and (c) certain investment funds. these
56
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries amendments are effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2015. we are assessing the impact of these amendments on our financial statements.

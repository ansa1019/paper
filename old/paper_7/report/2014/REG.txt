item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview regency centers corporation began its operations as a reit in 1993 and is the managing general partner of regency centers, l.p. all of our operating, investing, and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and through its co-investment partnerships. as of december 31, 2014, the parent company owned approximately 99.8% of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership.
as of december 31, 2014, we directly owned 202 consolidated properties located in 21 states representing 23.2 million square feet of gla. through co-investment partnerships, we own partial ownership interests in 120 unconsolidated properties located in 23 states and the district of columbia representing 15.0 million square feet of gla.
we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores, major retail anchors, restaurants, side-shop retailers, and service providers, as well as ground leasing or selling out-parcels to these same types of tenants. we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers.
we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development. we will continue to use our development capabilities, market presence, and anchor relationships to invest in value-added new developments and redevelopments of existing centers. we fund our acquisition and development activity from various capital sources including operating cash flow, property sales, equity offerings, new financing, and co-investment real estate partnerships. co-investment real estate partnerships provide us with an additional capital source for shopping center acquisitions, developments, and redevelopments, as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management, property management, and other investing and financing services.
critical accounting policies and estimates knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements. the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period. these accounting estimates are based upon, but not limited to, our judgments about historical and expected future results, current market conditions, and interpretation of industry accounting standards. they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.
accounts receivable and straight line rent minimum rent, percentage rent, and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes are the company's principal source of revenue. as a result of generating this revenue, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants. we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables. to address the collectability of these receivables, we analyze historical write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve. although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.

real estate investments acquisition of real estate investments upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases and in-place leases), assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. based on these estimates, the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities. fair value is determined based on an exit price approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. if, up to one year from the acquisition date, information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis. the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred.
we strategically co-invest with partners to own, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop operating properties. we analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated. if it is determined that these investments do not require consolidation because the entities are not variable interest entities ("vies"), we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities determined to be vies, we do not have voting control, and/or the limited partners (or non-managing members) have substantive participatory rights, then the selection of the accounting method used to account for our investments in real estate partnerships is generally determined by our voting interests and the degree of influence we have over the entity. management uses its judgment when making these determinations. we use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we own 20% or more of the voting interests and have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest, or if we own less than 20% of the voting interests but have determined that we have significant influence. under the equity method, we record our investments in and advances to these entities as investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated balance sheets, and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the joint venture is recognized in equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations.
development of real estate assets and cost capitalization we capitalize the acquisition of land, the construction of buildings, and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. other specifically identifiable development costs include pre-development costs essential to the development process, as well as, interest, real estate taxes, and direct employee costs incurred during the development period. once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy, these indirect costs are no longer capitalized.
•   pre-development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits, legal, engineering, and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center. if we determine it is probable that a specific project undergoing due diligence will not be developed, we immediately expense all related capitalized pre-development costs not considered recoverable.
•   interest costs are capitalized to each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended. we cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor opens for business. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, we capitalized interest of $7.1 million, $6.1 million, and $3.7 million, respectively, on our development projects.
•   real estate taxes are capitalized to each development project over the same period as we capitalize interest.
•   we have a staff of employees who directly support our development program. all direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project. the capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, we capitalized $16.1 million, $11.7 million, and $10.3 million, respectively, of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program.
valuation of real estate investments we evaluate whether there are any indicators that have occurred, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that would result in us determining that the carrying value of our real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable. if such indicators occur, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate
44
disposition of the asset. our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold period, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate. these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment, if any, could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arm's length transaction. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value. changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the company's financial condition or operating performance.
we evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators, including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired. an investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an other-than-temporary basis. cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors, such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other-than-temporary. these factors include the age of the real estate partnerships, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks. if we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, no impairment charge is recorded. if our analysis indicates that there is an other-than-temporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership, the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment.
the fair value of real estate investments is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization or the traditional discounted cash flow methods. such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore are subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value. in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.
derivative instruments the company utilizes financial derivative instruments to manage risks associated with changing interest rates. specifically, the company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts, the amount of which are determined by interest rates.  the company's derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the company's known or expected cash payments principally related to the company's borrowings.  for additional information on the company's use and accounting for derivatives, see notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
the company assesses effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis. the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of equity. our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation period and libor rate.  if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected.
the fair value of the company's interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.  the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.

leasing activity was strong in 2014 with pro-rata occupancy gains of 70 basis points driven primarily by new leasing in the less than 10,000 sqft category, but also supported by high renewal activity of expiring leases in both categories as summarized in the leasing activity table below, and lower than historical move-out rates. we believe our high-quality, grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated, desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail tenants. improvements in the economy, combined with historically low levels of new supply and robust tenant demand, allow us to focus on merchandising of our centers to ensure the right mix of operators and unique retailers, which draws more retail customers to our centers.

significant tenants and concentrations of risk we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification and by avoiding dependence on any single property, market, or tenant. the following table summarizes our three most significant tenants, each of which is a grocery tenant, occupying our shopping centers at december 31, 2014:

in january 2015, safeway inc. and ab acquisition llc (albertsons) completed their proposed merger announced in march 2014. in addition to the centers anchored by safeway above, we have 12 shopping centers anchored by albertsons, representing 1.4% of company owned gla and 1.0% of annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis. the federal trade commission ("ftc") is requiring that they divest 168 stores. of these, six are in our shopping centers and are under contract to be purchased by haggen.
bankruptcies although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy may have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues. we monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers, especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition, business practice, and store closings in other locations. we are not currently aware of the pending bankruptcy or announced store closings of any tenants in our shopping centers that would individually cause a material reduction in our revenues, and no tenant represents more than 5% of our annual base rent on a pro-rata basis.
our management team devotes significant time to monitoring consumer preferences, shopping behaviors, and demographics to anticipate both challenges and opportunities in the changing retail industry that may affect our tenants. as a result of our findings, we may reduce new leasing, suspend leasing, or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer.

net cash provided by operating activities:
net cash provided by operating activities increased by $27.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 due to:
•   $27.9 million increase in cash from operating income; offset by
•   $3.0 million net decrease in cash due to timing of cash receipts and payments related to operating activities;
•   $2.6 million decrease in operating cash flow distributions from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships due to liquidating three partnerships and reinvesting cash in another; and
•   $4.6 million received upon settlement of the treasury hedges in may 2014 in connection with our bond issuance.
we operate our business such that we expect net cash provided by operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our distributions to our common and preferred stock and unit holders, which were $194.0 million and $189.2 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors who monitor our financial position. our board of directors recently declared our common stock quarterly dividend of $0.485 per share, payable on march 5, 2015. future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability. we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes.
net cash used in investing activities:
net cash used in investing activities increased by $200.5 million due to lower real estate dispositions during 2014 within our consolidated and unconsolidated portfolio coupled with a slight increase in acquisitions and development activity, which were funded from sales proceeds and financing activity.

significant investing and divesting activities included:
•   we acquired four shopping centers in 2014, compared to three during 2013;
•   we sold eleven shopping centers and six out-parcels in 2014, compared to twelve shopping centers and ten out-parcels during 2013;
•   we received proceeds of $27.4 million upon the collection and sale of notes receivable in 2013;

•   we invested $23.6 million in our unconsolidated partnerships to acquire an operating property and to fund redevelopment activity during 2014. in 2013, we invested $10.9 million primarily for mortgage maturities, one operating property acquisition, and redevelopment activity.
•   distributions from our unconsolidated partnerships in 2014 were primarily driven by real estate sales proceeds of $32.1 million and $5.1 million from refinancing a loan. distributions in 2013 were primarily from real estate sales proceeds of $32.7 million, $6.9 million net proceeds from debt refinancing, and $47.5 million distributions upon redemption of preferred interest.
•   acquisition of securities and proceeds from sale of securities include investments in equity securities. in 2014, we paid $14.3 million for the acquisition of amreit, inc. ("amreit") common stock, and received $22.1 million in proceeds upon the subsequent sale. the remaining securities investing activity, during both 2014 and 2013, primarily relates to our deferred compensation plan.
we plan to continue developing and redeveloping shopping centers for long-term investment purposes and have a staff of employees who directly support our development and redevelopment program. internal costs attributable to these development and redevelopment activities are capitalized as part of each project. during 2014, we paid $238.2 million for the development, redevelopment, and improvement of our real estate properties as comprised of the following (in thousands):

•   during 2014 we acquired six land parcels for new development projects as compared to five in 2013.
•   building and tenant improvements decreased $7.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily related to timing of capital projects and renovations.
•   the $28.9 million increase in redevelopment costs were due to an increase in the number and magnitude of redevelopments, primarily driven by our westlake and westchester redevelopment projects.
•   the $6.3 million decrease in our development projects expenditures was due to the size of and progress on developments. see the tables below for a detail of current and recently completed development projects.
•   capitalized direct compensation represents overhead costs of our development and construction team directly related to the development projects, with the majority of capitalizable direct compensation costs incurred at or near inception of a development project. the increased number and size of projects starting in 2014 as compared to 2013 resulted in the increase in capitalized compensation costs. during 2014 we started $239.2 million of development and redevelopment projects as compared to $194.3 million in 2013. changes in the level of future development and redevelopment activity could adversely impact results of operations by reducing the amount of internal costs for development and redevelopment projects that may be capitalized. a 10% reduction in development and redevelopment activity without a corresponding reduction in the compensation costs directly related to our development and redevelopment activities could result in an additional charge to net income of approximately $1.6 million.

as of december 31, 2014, we had seven development projects that were either under construction or in lease up, compared to six such development projects as of december 31, 2013. the following table summarizes our development projects as of december 31, 2014 (in thousands, except cost per sqft):

net cash used in financing activities:
net cash used in financing activities decreased by $148.2 million primarily due to proceeds from the net issuance of unsecured notes in 2014 and net repayments on the credit facilities in 2013. the following table presents changes in our primary categories of financing activity:

significant financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2014 include:
•   during 2014, the parent company issued approximately 1.7 million shares of common stock through our atm program at an average price of $60.00 per share, as compared to 1.9 million shares at $53.35 per share in 2013. in both years, the proceeds were used to fund investment activities.
•   the $6.8 million change in net distributions to limited partners is primarily related to 2014 distribution of proceeds from sales and debt financing.
•   during 2014 we increased our dividend distribution rates on our common stock and operating partnership units.
•   during 2013, we paid down our line and term loan $95.0 million, net.
•   the $222.6 million net change in debt issuance is primarily related to the $250 million of new 3.75% ten-year unsecured public debt issued in may 2014, which matures in june 2024. in connection with the bond offering, we settled the previously locked forward starting interest rate swaps, receiving net cash proceeds of $4.6 million. these proceeds will offset bond interest expense over the life of the bonds, resulting in a lower effective interest rate of 3.59%.
•   the $160.1 million net change in debt repayment is primarily driven by the repayment of $150 million of 4.95% ten-year unsecured public debt at maturity. in april 2014.
we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets. as of december 31, 2014, 76.8% of our wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered. such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain significant availability on the line. our coverage ratio, including our pro-rata share of our partnerships, was 2.5 times for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to 2.4 times for the year ended december 31, 2013. we define our coverage ratio as earnings before interest, taxes, investment transaction profits net of deal costs, depreciation and amortization ("core ebitda") divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders.
through 2015, we estimate that we will require approximately $622.7 million of cash, including $179.2 million to complete in-process developments and redevelopments, $426.2 million to repay maturing debt, and approximately $17.3 to fund our pro-rata share of estimated capital contributions to our co-investment partnerships for repayment of debt. if we start new developments or redevelop additional shopping centers, our cash requirements will increase. if we refinance maturing debt, our cash requirements will decrease. to meet our cash requirements, we will utilize cash generated from operations, borrowings from our line and term loan, proceeds from the sale of real estate, cash receipts from our forward equity offering, and when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from the sale of equity and the issuance of debt.
we have $350.0 million of fixed rate, unsecured debt maturing in august 2015 and $400.0 million of fixed rate, unsecured debt maturing in june 2017. in order to mitigate the risk of interest rate volatility, we previously entered into $220.0 million of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new debt expected to be issued in 2015 and an additional $220.0 million of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new debt expected to be issued in 2017. these interest rate swaps lock in the 10-year treasury rate and swap spread at a weighted average fixed rate of 2.67% and 3.48%, respectively. a current market based credit spread applicable to regency will be added to the locked in fixed rate at time of issuance that will determine the final bond yield. we will cash settle these forward starting interest rate swaps when we issue the new debt. the actual cash settlement may differ from the current fair value of these interest rate swaps based on movements in interest rates.
we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments. based upon the current capital markets, our current credit ratings, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings, we currently expect that we will successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund our obligations, as needed.
our line, term loan, and unsecured loans require we remain in compliance with various covenants, which are described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31, 2014 and expect to remain in compliance.

(1) pro-rata financial information is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in accordance with gaap. however, management believes that providing such information is useful to investors in assessing the impact of its investments in real estate partnership activities on our operations, which includes such items on a single line presentation under the equity method in its consolidated financial statements.
(2) the difference between our share of the net assets of the co-investment partnerships and our investments in real estate partnerships per the accompanying consolidated balance sheets relates primarily to differences in inside/outside basis as further described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
in addition to earning our pro-rata share of net income or loss in each of these co-investment partnerships, we receive fees, as shown below, for each of the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 (dollars in thousands):

contractual obligations we have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans, unsecured notes, unsecured credit facilities and interest rate swap obligations as described further below and in note 9 and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. we have shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and/or operate a shopping center. in addition, we have non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business.
the following table of contractual obligations summarizes our debt maturities, including our pro-rata share of obligations within co-investment partnerships, (in thousands) as of december 31, 2014, and excludes the following:
•   recorded debt premiums or discounts that are not obligations;
•   obligations related to construction or development contracts, since payments are only due upon satisfactory performance under the contracts;
•   letters of credit of $5.9 million issued to cover performance obligations on certain development projects, which will be satisfied upon completion of the development projects; and,
•   obligations for retirement savings plans due to uncertainty around timing of participant withdrawals, which are solely within the control of the participant, and are further discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities (other than our co-investment partnerships) or other persons, also known as variable interest entities, not previously discussed. our co-investment partnership properties have been financed with non-recourse loans. we have no guarantees related to these loans.
results from operations comparison of the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013:
our revenues increased in 2014, as compared to 2013, as summarized in the following table (in thousands):
2014                  2013                    change minimum rent                                      $390,697           353,833       36,864

total revenues                                    $537,898           489,007       48,891
minimum rent increased as follows:
•   $29.1 million increase due to the acquisitions of operating properties and operations beginning at development properties;
•   $9.9 million increase in minimum rent from same properties, which was driven by rental rate and occupancy growth and increases from contractual rent steps in existing leases. same property includes operating properties owned for the entirety of both periods being presented;
•   these increases were offset by a $2.2 decrease from operating properties sold in 2014 that no longer are reported as discontinued operations.
recoveries from tenants and other income represent reimbursements from tenants for their pro-rata share of the operating, maintenance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers, as well as other income earned at our operating properties. increases are due to the following:
•   $6.9 million increase due to the acquisition of operating properties and operations beginning at development properties during 2014 and 2013; and,
•   $6.2 million increase in recoveries at same properties, which was driven by an increase in occupancy and by an increase in recoverable costs, and $1.4 million increase in other income primarily related to settlements and termination fees;
•   offset by a $1.4 million decrease from operating properties sold in 2014 that no longer are reported as discontinued operations.
we earned fees, at market-based rates, for asset management, property management, leasing, acquisition, and financing services that we provided to our co-investment partnerships and third parties as follows (in thousands):
2014                2013                   change asset management fees                       $6,013            6,205         (192   )
property management fees                    13,020           13,692         (672   )
leasing commissions and other fees           5,062            5,200         (138   )
$24,095           25,097       (1,002   )
asset and property management fees decreased due to the liquidation of one unconsolidated real estate partnership consisting of nine properties during the third quarter of 2013, partially offset by higher asset and property management fees from our other partnerships.
56
our operating expenses increased in 2014, as compared to 2013, as summarized in the following table (in thousands):
2014                  2013                        change depreciation and amortization          $147,791           130,630           17,161

real estate taxes                        59,031            53,726            5,305
other operating expenses                  8,496             8,079       417
total operating expenses               $353,348           324,687           28,661
depreciation and amortization increased $17.2 million. the increase is largely attributable to the following: $9.9 million from acquisitions, $5.5 million from new development operations and $2.6 million at same properties due to redevelopments and capital improvements, offset by a decrease of approximately $800,000 from disposals.
operating and maintenance increased $6.8 million. the increase relates to the following: $2.0 million from acquisitions, $2.6 million from new development operations, and $2.4 million at same property driven by an increase in snow removal costs, offset by approximately $200,000 from sold properties.
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $1.0 million largely due to greater capitalization of development overhead costs by $4.4 million, stemming from higher volume of development projects, offset by an increase of $4.6 million of higher incentive compensation expense during 2014. additionally, changes in participant obligations within the deferred compensation plan resulted in a $1.9 million decrease in expense.
real estate taxes increased $5.3 million. the increase largely consists of the following: $2.6 million from acquisitions, $1.6 million from new development operations, and $1.4 million at same properties from higher assessed values, partially offset by approximately $300,000 from sold properties.

see table below for a discussion of interest expense.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized a $175,000 impairment on two parcels of land held and $1.1 million of loss on the disposal of one operating property and one land parcel. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recognized a $6.0 million impairment on a single operating property.
net investment income increased $6.2 million, largely driven by an $8.1 million gain realized on the sale of available for sale securities offset by a $1.9 million decrease in net investment income from deferred compensation plan related to the change in the fair value of plan assets.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we acquired the remaining 50% interest and gained control of a previously unconsolidated investment in real estate partnership that owns a single operating property. as the operating property constitutes a business, acquisition of control was accounted for as a step acquisition, and the net assets acquired were recognized at fair value. the gain of $18.3 million was recognized as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the company's previously held equity interest, using an income approach to measure fair value.

(3) on october 23, 2013, the company sold 100% of its interest in the bret unconsolidated real estate partnership and received a capital distribution of $47.5 million, its share of the undistributed income of the partnership, and a redemption premium. regency no longer has any interest in the bret partnership.
the decrease in our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships is principally due to the following:
•   $947,000 of pro-rata gains on one operating property disposed of within grir.
•   $1.0 million decrease within columbia ii due to $424,000 of pro-rata impairment losses recognized upon sale of two properties in 2014 and $830,000 of gains recognized in 2013 on the sale of 4 operating properties and one land parcel;
•   $654,000 of pro-rata gains on one operating property disposed of within regcal in 2014;
•   the fund sold all its operating properties in august 2013 for pro-rata gains of $7.4 million. the only activity in 2014 was collection of remaining receivables and the final distribution;
•   $4.5 million decrease from liquidating our ownership interest in bret in october 2013; and,
•   $11.2 million increase within our other investment partnerships driven by the 2014 gains on sale of two land parcels and two operating properties.

minimum rent increased as follows:
•   $22.5 million increase due to the acquisitions of operating properties and operations beginning at development properties; and
•   $8.2 million increase in minimum rent from same properties, which was driven by rental rate and occupancy growth and increases from contractual rent steps in existing leases. same property includes operating properties owned for the entirety of both periods being presented.
•   these increases were offset by a $17.8 million decrease due to the sale of a 15-property portfolio in july 2012 not considered discontinued operations.
recoveries from tenants and other income represent reimbursements from tenants for their pro-rata share of the operating, maintenance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers, as well as other income earned at our operating properties. increases are due to the following:
•   $4.7 million increase due to the acquisition of operating properties and operations beginning at development properties during 2013 and 2012; and
•   $6.1 million increase in recoveries at same properties, which was driven primarily by an increase in occupancy and an increase in recoverable costs.

•   these increases were offset by a $5.1 million decrease due to the sale of a 15-property portfolio in july 2012 not considered discontinued operations.
other income decreased by $2.2 million as a result of final distributions from our terminated third party managed captive insurance program and establishing a consolidated captive insurance subsidiary during 2012.

$25,097           26,511       (1,414   )
asset and property management fees decreased approximately $815,000 due to the liquidation of two unconsolidated real estate partnerships during 2013, resulting in $1.1 million reduction in asset and property management fees, partially offset by higher asset and property management fees from our other partnerships. leasing commissions and other fees decreased during 2013, as compared to 2012, due to the two liquidations discussed above and a decrease in leasing activities performed for co-investment partnerships and third parties during 2013, as occupancy levels stabilize and less vacant gla was available for lease.
our operating expenses increased as summarized in the following table (in thousands):
2013                  2012                        change depreciation and amortization          $130,630           119,008           11,622

total operating expenses               $324,687           307,493           17,194
depreciation and amortization increased $11.6 million. the increase is largely attributable to the following: $8.3 million from acquisitions, $6.5 million at same properties, and $4.7 million from new development operations, offset by $7.5 million decrease from the sale of a 15 property portfolio in july 2012 not considered discontinued operations.
operating and maintenance increased $4.3 million. the increase substantially relates to the following: $4.0 million from acquisitions, $1.6 million from new development operations, and $3.0 million at same properties, offset by $4.3 million from the sale of a 15 property portfolio in july 2012 not considered discontinued operations.
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $466,000 largely due to greater capitalization of development overhead costs of approximately $1.4 million, due to higher volume of development projects, offset by a decrease in capitalization of leasing overhead costs of $1.2 million as occupancy levels stabilize and less vacant gla was available to lease. the net change in compensation and other overhead costs resulted in additional savings of approximately $200,000.
real estate taxes increased approximately $815,000. the increase largely consists of the following: $2.4 million from acquisitions and new development operations, $1.3 million at same properties from higher assessed values, offset by $2.9 million from the sale of a 15 property portfolio in july 2012 not considered discontinued operations.
other operating expenses increased approximately $892,000 primarily due to an increase in environmental remediation reserves, offset by decreases in bad debt expense and acquisition and pursuit costs.

see table below for a discussion of interest expense.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recognized a $6.0 million impairment on a single operating property. during the year ended december 31, 2012, we recognized total impairments of $20.3 million, including $18.1 million related to the 15-property portfolio sold in july 2012, and $2.2 million related to three land parcels.
during 2013, we repaid two mortgages early with minimal remaining unamortized loan costs. on july 20, 2012, we repaid $150.0 million of our term loan, and as a result of this early extinguishment of debt, we expensed approximately $852,000 in remaining unamortized loan costs.
the $1.2 million increase in net investment income from deferred compensation plan related to the change in the fair value of plan assets from december 31, 2012 to december 31, 2013 and is consistent with the change in plan liabilities, included in general and administrative expenses above.
the following table presents the change in interest expense (in thousands):

$108,966           112,129           (3,163   )
our interest expense decreased primarily due to paying down our unsecured credit facilities and mortgages, coupled with greater interest capitalization on development projects, driven by the increase in cumulative development project costs over the prior year.

(2) on august 13, 2013, regency retail partners, lp (the "fund") sold 100% of its interest in its entire portfolio of shopping centers to a third party. the fund will be dissolved following the final distribution of proceeds.
(3) on october 23, 2013, the company sold 100% of its interest in the bret unconsolidated real estate partnership and received a capital distribution of $47.5 million, its share of the undistributed income of the partnership, and a redemption premium. regency no longer has any interest in the bret partnership.
the increase in our equity in income in investments in real estate partnerships is principally due to the following:
•   $3.5 million increase from the grir partnership due to various factors, including: increased tenant percentage rent, recovery revenue rates, and settlement proceeds; coupled with lower interest expense as a result of paying off debt in 2012 and the loss on debt extinguishment and provision for impairment in 2012 that did not occur in 2013. these increases are offset by higher depreciation expense from redevelopments.
•   $6.8 million decrease from the columbia i partnership primarily due to our $6.9 million pro-rata gain on sale of an operating property that was sold in april 2012,
•   $7.5 million increase from the fund due to recognizing $7.4 million pro-rata gain on the sale of all operating properties within the fund in august 2013, and
•   $2.3 million increase from our ownership interest retained in bret, as part of the 15-property portfolio sale completed in july 2012, which we redeemed 100% of our ownership interest for cash in october 2013.

the decrease in income tax expense of taxable reit subsidiary is due to the large expense recognized during 2012 as a full valuation allowance was established on the balance of our deferred tax assets.
income from discontinued operations of $65.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 included $58.0 million in gains, net of taxes, from the sale of twelve properties and the operations of the shopping centers sold. loss from discontinued operations of $21.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2012 included the operations of the shopping centers sold during 2012 and 2013, and $21.9 million in gains, net of taxes, from the sale of five properties; offset by $54.5 million of impairment losses.
the decrease in preferred stock dividends is attributable to the $9.3 million non-cash charges recognized during 2012 upon redemption of the series 3, 4 and 5 preferred stock.

supplemental earnings information we use certain non-gaap performance measures, in addition to the required gaap presentations, as we believe these measures are beneficial to us in improving the understanding of our operational results among the investing public. we believe such measures make comparisons of other reits' operating results to ours more meaningful. we continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, and calculation of our reported non-gaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.
the following are our definitions of same property net operating income ("noi"), funds from operations ("ffo"), and core ffo, which we believe to be beneficial non-gaap performance measures used in understanding our operational results:
   noi is calculated as total property revenues (minimum rent, percentage rents, and recoveries from tenants and other income) less direct property operating expenses (operating and maintenance and real estate taxes) from the properties owned by us, and excludes corporate-level income (including management, transaction, and other fees), for the entirety of the periods presented. noi excludes straight-line rental income, net of reserves, above and below market rent amortization, banking charges, and other fees
•   pro-rata information includes 100% of our consolidated properties plus our ownership interest in our unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships.
•   same property information is provided for operating properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared and excludes all properties in development and non-same properties. a non-same property is a property acquired during either period being compared, a development completion that is less than 90% funded and 95% leased or features less than two years of anchor operations. same property also excludes projects in development, which represent projects owned and intended to be developed, including partially operating properties acquired specifically for redevelopment and excluding land held for future development. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for an expanded definition of properties in development.
•   same property noi includes noi for same property, which is a key measure used by management in evaluating the performance of our properties.
•   ffo is a commonly used measure of reit performance, which the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines as net income, computed in accordance with gaap, excluding gains and losses from sales of depreciable property, net of tax, excluding operating real estate impairments, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. we compute ffo for all periods presented in accordance with nareit's definition. many companies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions. since ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from depreciable property dispositions, and impairments, it can provide a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. this provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with gaap. thus, ffo is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of our operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore, should not be considered an alternative for cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
•   core ffo is an additional performance measure used by regency as the computation of ffo includes certain non-cash and non-comparable items that affect the company's period-over-period performance. core ffo excludes from ffo, but is not limited to: (a) transaction related gains, income or expense; (b) impairments on land; (c) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; and (d) other non-core amounts as they occur. the company provides a reconciliation of ffo to core ffo below.

environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks. we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations. generally, we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems. where available, we have applied and been accepted into state-sponsored environmental programs. we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for third-party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination. we have also placed environmental insurance, where possible, on specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk. we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites. we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so.
as of december 31, 2014 we had accrued liabilities of $10.2 million for our pro-rata share of environmental remediation. we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations; however, we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us.
inflation/deflation inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers; however, inflation may become a greater concern in the future. substantially all of our long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro-rata share of operating expenses, including common-area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. in addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. however, during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness, minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines. occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses.

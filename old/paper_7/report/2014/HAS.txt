executive summary hasbro, inc. (hasbro or the company) is a global company committed to creating the worlds best play experiences. the company strives to do this through deep consumer engagement and the application of consumer insights, the use of immersive storytelling to build brands, product innovation and development of global business reach. hasbro applies these principles to leverage its beloved owned and controlled brands, including littlest pet shop, magic: the gathering, monopoly, my little pony, nerf, play-doh and transformers, as well as its premier partner brands. from toys and games, to television programming, motion pictures, digital gaming and a comprehensive licensing program, hasbro fulfills the fundamental need for play and connection for children and families around the world. the companys wholly owned hasbro studios creates entertainment brand-driven storytelling across mediums, including television, film and more. these illustrate successful execution of its brand blueprint.
at the center of this blueprint, hasbro re-imagines, re-invents and re-ignites its owned and controlled brands and imagines, invents and ignites new brands, through toy and game innovation, immersive entertainment offerings, including television programming and motion pictures, and a broad range of licensed products, ranging from traditional to high-tech, under well-known brand names structured within the companys brand architecture and offering consumers the ability to experience the companys brands in all areas of their lives.
to accomplish these objectives, the company offers consumers the ability to experience its branded play through innovative toys and games, digital media, lifestyle licensing and publishing and entertainment, including television programming and motion pictures. the companys focus remains on growing its owned and controlled brands and the brands of its partners, developing new and innovative products and brands which respond to market insights, offering entertainment experiences which allow consumers to experience the companys brands across multiple forms and formats, and optimizing efficiencies within the company to increase operating margins and maintain a strong balance sheet.
hasbro earns revenue and generates cash primarily through the sale of a broad variety of toy and game products and distribution of television programming based on the companys properties, as well as through the out-licensing of rights for use of its properties in connection with complementary products, including digital media and games and lifestyle products, offered by third parties, or in certain situations, toy products where the company considers the out-licensing of brands to be more effective. the companys brand architecture includes franchise brands, key partner brands, challenger brands, gaming mega brands and new brands. the companys franchise and challenger brands represent company-owned brands or brands which if not entirely owned are broadly controlled by the company, and have been successful over the long term. franchise brands are the companys most significant owned or controlled brands which it believes have the ability to deliver significant revenue over the long-term. challenger brands are brands which have not yet achieved franchise brand status, but have the potential to do so with investment and time. the companys franchise brands are littlest pet shop, magic: the gathering, monopoly, my little pony, nerf, play-doh and transformers, while challenger brands include baby alive, furreal friends, furby, kre-o, playskool and playskool heroes. the company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands which can be introduced in new forms and formats over time. these brands may also be further extended by
29
pairing a licensed concept with an owned or controlled brand. by focusing on these brands, the company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth, and to leverage profitability. during 2014 net revenues from the companys franchise brands increased by 31% and totaled 55% of total consolidated net revenues.
the companys innovative product offerings encompass a broad variety of toys including boys action figures, vehicles and play sets, girls toys, electronic toys, plush products, preschool toys and infant products, electronic interactive products, creative play and toy-related specialty products. games offerings include board, off-the-board, digital, card, electronic, trading card and role-playing games.
while hasbro believes it has built a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its owned or controlled brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties, it continues to selectively enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and key strengths and allow the company to offer innovative products based on movie, television and other entertainment properties owned by third parties. the companys primary licenses include its agreements with marvel characters b.v. (marvel) for characters in the marvel universe, including spider-man and the avengers; lucas licensing, ltd. (lucas), related to the star wars brand; sesame workshop, related to the sesame street characters and rovio entertainment ltd. related to the angry birds brand. both marvel and lucas are owned by the walt disney company (disney). in 2013, the company and disney amended both the marvel and lucas agreements which extended the term of the license for marvel characters through 2020 and provides additional guaranteed royalty payments with respect to both marvel and star wars products in anticipation of expected future motion pictures and other related entertainment through 2020. in september 2014, the companys strategic merchandising relationship with disney expanded to include product offerings, specifically small and fashion dolls, based on the popular disney princess and frozen brands, commencing in 2016. also in 2014 the company entered into an agreement with disney allowing the company to offer certain products based on the disney descendants brand beginning in 2015. in addition to offering products based on licensed entertainment properties, the company also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors.
sales of marvel products are dependent upon the number and type of theatrical releases in any given year. in 2014, the company had sales of marvel products related to three theatrical releases: captain america: the winter soldier, the amazing spider-man and guardians of the galaxy. in 2013, the company only had sales of marvel products related to the may release of iron man 3; however, these sales were not as significant as those sales of products in 2012 related to the theatrical releases of marvels the avengers and the amazing spider-man. during 2015, the company will market products related to two planned theatrical motion picture releases based on marvel characters including avengers: age of ultron. furthermore, 2015 sales of star wars products will be supported by the highly anticipated release of star wars: the force awakens from lucasfilm ltd. as well as jurassic world from universal pictures.
the company also seeks to build all-encompassing brand experiences and drive product-related revenues by increasing the visibility of its brands through entertainment such as motion pictures and television programming. since 2007, the company has had a number of motion pictures based on its brands released by major motion picture studios including four motion pictures based on its transformers brand, two motion pictures based on its g.i. joe brand and two motion pictures based on its gaming brands, battleship and ouija. the company developed and marketed product lines based on these motion pictures. the company has also released animated movies based on its my little pony and my little pony: equestria girls brands. in october 2015, the company plans to re-ignite an archived brand with the expected release of jem and the holograms by hasbros own recently established film label, allspark pictures.
in addition to using motion pictures to provide entertainment experiences for its brands, the company has an internal wholly-owned production studio, hasbro studios, which is responsible for the creation and development of storytelling based on hasbros brands, across mediums including television, film and digital shorts. the television programming is currently aired in markets throughout the world. domestically, hasbro studios programming is distributed primarily to hub television network, llc, formally known as hub network
30
and, as of october 13, 2014, now the discovery family channel (the network). internationally, hasbro studios also distributes to various broadcasters and cable networks and globally on various digital platforms, including netflix and itunes. beginning in 2015, hasbro studios will begin distributing certain programming domestically to other outlets, including cartoon network. the companys television initiatives support its strategy of growing its brands well beyond traditional toys and games and providing entertainment experiences for consumers of all ages in many forms or formats.
the network is the companys joint venture with discovery communications, inc. (discovery) and is a cable television network in the united states dedicated to high-quality childrens and family entertainment and educational programming. programming on the network includes content based on hasbros brands as well as programming developed by discovery and other third parties. prior to september 2014, the company and discovery each owned a 50% equity interest in the network. in september 2014, hasbro and discovery amended their relationship with respect to the network, reducing hasbros equity interest from 50% to 40%.
hasbros strategic blueprint and brand architecture focuses on extending its brands through digital media and gaming. in support of this strategy, in 2013, the company acquired a 70% majority ownership in backflip studios, llc (backflip), a mobile game developer based in boulder, colorado. backflips product offerings include games for tablets and mobile devices including dragonvale, ninjump and paper toss. new game brands released during 2014 include dwarven den, plundernauts, spellfall and seabeard. backflip also introduced two game brands under hasbro brands, specifically nerfhoops and twister tap. in 2015 and beyond, backflip intends to continue focusing on its existing game titles, particularly dragonvale, and to launch new games, including those based on hasbro brands. to further extend its brands into digital media and gaming, the company also out-licenses its properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games and other gaming experiences based on those brands. one example of these digital gaming relationships is the companys agreement with electronic arts inc. (ea) under which ea has the rights to develop several of hasbros best-selling gaming brands for mobile platforms globally. similarly, the company has an agreement with activision under which activision offers digital games based on the transformers brand, as well as with other third-party digital gaming companies, including dena and gameloft.
lastly, hasbro seeks to express its brands through its lifestyle licensing business. under its lifestyle licensing programs, the company enters into relationships with a broad spectrum of apparel, publishing, food, bedding and other lifestyle products companies for the global marketing and distribution of licensed products based on the companys brands. these relationships further broaden and amplify the consumers ability to experience the companys brands.
as hasbro seeks to grow its business in entertainment, licensing and digital gaming, the company will continue to evaluate strategic alliances, acquisitions and investments like hasbro studios and backflip, which may complement its current product offerings, allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to or complementary to the toy and game business, or allow it to further develop awareness of its brands and expand the ability of consumers to experience its brands in different forms and formats.
during the fourth quarter of 2012 the company announced a multi-year cost savings initiative in which it targets annual cost reductions of $100,000 by the end of 2015. this plan included an approximate 10% workforce reduction, facility consolidations and process improvements which reduce redundancy and increase efficiencies. from 2012 through 2014, the company incurred aggregate restructuring and related pension charges of $84,972 and product-related charges of $19,736 related to this plan. through 2014, the company recognized gross cost savings, before restructuring costs, from these actions of approximately $90,000. these savings are prior to other costs which have or are anticipated to increase in 2014 and in future years, such as compensation costs and other investments in certain components of the business.
the companys business is highly seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year. in each of 2014 and 2013, the second half of the year accounted for 65% of net revenues while the second half of 2012 accounted for 64% of net revenues.

hasbro sells its products both within the united states and throughout international markets. in recent years, the companys international segment net revenues have experienced growth as the company has sought to increase its global presence. net revenues of the companys international segment represented 47%, 46% and 44% of total net revenues in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the company has driven international growth by opportunistically opening offices in certain markets, primarily emerging markets, to develop this greater global presence. the company believes emerging markets offer greater opportunity for revenue growth than in developed economies which have faced challenging economic environments in recent years. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, net revenues from emerging markets increased by 20%, 25% and 16%, respectively.
the companys business is separated into three principal business segments, u.s. and canada, international and entertainment and licensing. the u.s. and canada segment develops, markets and sells both toy and game products in the united states and canada. the international segment consists of the companys european, asia pacific and latin and south american toy and game marketing and sales operations. the companys entertainment and licensing segment includes the companys lifestyle licensing, digital licensing and gaming, movie and television entertainment operations. in addition to these three primary segments, the companys world-wide manufacturing and product sourcing operations are managed through its global operations segment.
the company is committed to returning excess cash to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. as part of this initiative, from 2005 through 2013, the companys board of directors (the board) adopted seven successive share repurchase authorizations with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of $3,325,000. at december 28, 2014, the company had $64,151 remaining available under theses authorizations. during the three years ended 2014, the company spent a total of $663,385, to repurchase 13,453 shares in the open market. the company intends to, at its discretion, opportunistically repurchase shares in the future subject to market conditions, the companys other potential uses of cash and the companys levels of cash generation. subsequent to year-end, in february 2015, the companys board of directors approved an eighth share repurchase authorization for $500,000. in addition to the share repurchase program, the company also seeks to return excess cash through the payment of quarterly dividends. in february 2015 the companys board announced a 7% increase in the companys quarterly dividend rate to $0.46 per share from the prior year quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share. this was the eleventh dividend increase in the previous 12 years. during that period, the company has increased its quarterly cash dividend from $0.03 to $0.46 per share.

net revenues from transformers products benefited from higher sales and license revenues related to products based on the 2014 major motion picture release of transformers: age of extinction, as well as animated television programming in 2014, 2013 and 2012. furthermore, net revenues from nerf products also grew in both 2014 and 2013. growth in these boys brands reflects hasbros franchise brand-focused strategy.
sales of marvel products, primarily spider-man and avengers products, increased in 2014 compared to 2013. spider-man was supported by the 2014 major motion picture release of the amazing spider-man 2. 2014 net revenues also included sales related to the 2014 theatrical releases of captain america: the winter solidier and guardians of the galaxy. during 2013, sales of marvel products were primarily related to iron man, supported by the 2013 major motion picture release of iron man 3 and were lower than 2012, which included sales of avengers and spider-man related to the 2012 major motion picture releases of marvels the avengers and the amazing spider-man.
games: net revenues in the games category decreased 4% in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased 10% in 2013 compared to 2012. net revenues in both 2014 and 2013 include the acquisition of backflip. franchise brands magic: the gathering and monopoly continued to grow in 2014 and 2013. in 2014, higher net revenues from other games brands including simon, specifically simon swipe, the game of life, trouble and dungeons & dragons were more than offset by lower net revenues from other games brands, primarily duel masters, angry birds and twister. in 2013, several brands contributed to games category growth including, but not limited to, magic: the gathering, jenga, including sales of products co-branded under angry birds, elefun & friends, monopoly, duel masters, and twister, including twister rave. these higher net revenues were partially offset by lower net revenues from other game brands, including battleship and scrabble.
girls: net revenues in the girls category increased 2% in 2014 compared to 2013 and 26% in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily related to higher net revenues from franchise brands, my little pony and nerf rebelle in 2014 and 2013. net revenues related to furby also contributed to higher net revenues in 2013 compared to 2012, however, declined in 2014 compared to 2013. lower net revenues from littlest pet shop and furreal friends, partially offset growth in the girls category.

entertainment and licensing entertainment and licensing segment net revenues increased 15% in 2014 compared to 2013 and 5% in 2013 compared to 2012. increased net revenues in 2014 compared to 2013 were primarily related to higher net revenues from lifestyle licensing, along with contributions from digital gaming and a full year of net revenues from backflip, of which a 70% interest was acquired during the third quarter of 2013. partially offsetting these increases were lower net revenues related to entertainment. higher lifestyle licensing net revenues included growth in transformers and my little pony. higher net revenues in 2013 compared to 2012 included higher lifestyle licensing and digital gaming revenues, a partial year of revenues from backflip, and lower entertainment net revenues. entertainment net revenues were impacted from a higher level of 2012 net revenues related to digital distributions, which included the initial distribution of hasbro studios television programming libraries to netflix.
entertainment and licensing segment operating profit increased 33% in 2014 to $60,550 compared to $45,476 in 2013 and $53,191 in 2012. the increase in operating profit in 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to the profit impact from higher net revenues from lifestyle licensing, partially offset by the profit impact from lower entertainment revenues. the decrease in operating profit in 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to losses from entertainment and backflip that were partially offset by the favorable profit impact from higher licensing and digital gaming net revenues. backflip operating losses approximated $8,700 and $7,600 in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and were primarily due to amortization of acquired intangibles. operating profit for both 2013 and 2012 include restructuring charges of $1,729 and $555, respectively.
other segments and corporate and eliminations in the global operations segment, operating profit of $15,767 in 2014 compared to $6,712 in 2013 and operating losses of $15,964 in 2012. the operating loss in 2012 included severance costs of $4,307 associated with restructuring activities. the improvement in operating results in the global operations segment is primarily due to improvements made in owned manufacturing facilities and expense reductions associated with restructuring activities.

cost of sales primarily consists of purchased materials, labor, manufacturing overheads and other inventory-related costs such as obsolescence. cost of sales increased in dollars to $1,698,372 for the year ended december 28, 2014 from $1,672,901 and $1,671,980 for 2013 and 2012, respectively, but decreased as a percent of net revenues to 39.7% in 2014 from 41.0% in 2013 and 40.9% in 2012. absent the impact of aforementioned charges, cost of sales was $1,662,747, or 40.7% of net revenues, for the year ended december 29, 2013 and $1,669,216, or 40.8% of net revenues, for the year ended december 30, 2012. the cost of sales increase in dollars in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects higher net revenues. the cost of sales decrease as a percent of net revenues in 2014 compared to 2013 and 2012 reflects a more favorable revenue mix and impact from cost savings and efficiencies from the companys owned-manufacturing facilities partially offset by the impact on net revenues of higher sales promotions. in 2014, product mix reflects higher net revenues from royalty-bearing products which generally carry higher pricing and, therefore, have a lower cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues, as well as higher net revenues from the high margin entertainment and licensing segment.
royalty expense of $305,317, or 7.1% of net revenues, for the year ended december 28, 2014 compared to $338,919, or 8.3% of net revenues, for the year ended december 29, 2013 and $302,066, or 7.4% of net revenues, for the year ended december 30, 2012. excluding the impact of the arbitration award settlement and amendment of the zynga agreement summarized above, royalty expense was $275,118, or 6.7% of net revenues, in 2013. fluctuations in royalty expense are generally related to the volume of entertainment-driven products sold in a given year, especially if there is a major motion picture release. significant revenues from transformers in 2014 related to the 2014 release of transformers: age of extinction, and sale of marvel products in 2014 and 2012, particularly those related to the 2014 releases of captain america: the winter soldier, the amazing-spider man 2, and guardians of the galaxy and the 2012 releases of marvels the avengers and the amazing spider-man resulted in higher royalty expenses in those years compared to 2013.
product development expense in 2014 totaled $222,556, or 5.2% of net revenues, compared to $207,591, or 5.1% of net revenues, in 2013 and $201,197, or 4.9% of net revenues, in 2012. product development expense for 2013 and 2012 included restructuring charges of $4,101 and $10,949, respectively. excluding the impact of these charges, product development expense was $203,490 in 2013 and $190,248 in 2012. the increases in 2014 compared to 2013 and 2013 compared to 2012 primarily reflect the addition of backflip, as well as continued investment in certain brands, particularly magic: the gathering. furthermore, during the fourth quarter of 2014, the company began to incur development costs related to the disney princess and frozen license
40
agreement with disney. the company will continue to incur these development costs related to these properties in 2015 in advance of the commencement of the license period and product shipments in 2016.
advertising expense in 2014 totaled $420,256 compared to $398,098 in 2013 and $422,239 in 2012. the level of the companys advertising expense can generally be impacted by revenue mix, the amount and type of theatrical releases, and television programming. advertising expense was consistent as a percentage of net revenues in 2014 and 2013 at 9.8% of net revenues and decreased from 10.3% of net revenues in 2012. the increase in advertising expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher net revenues. the decrease in advertising expense in 2013 compared to 2012 was the result of the mix of 2013 net revenues as well as a higher portion of our spending in digital formats.
amortization of intangibles totaled $52,708, or 1.2% of net revenues, in 2014 compared to $78,186, or 1.9% of net revenues, in 2013 and $50,569, or 1.3% of net revenues, in 2012. amortization of intangibles in 2013 includes $19,736 related to impairment of definite-lived intangibles based on the companys decision to exit the related product lines. absent the impact of these charges, amortization of intangibles was $58,450, or 1.4% of net revenues, in 2013. lower amortization of intangibles in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects the impact of intangible assets which were fully amortized during 2013. higher amortization of intangibles in 2013 compared to 2012 reflects the acquisition of backflip in 2013.
program production cost amortization totaled $47,086, or 1.1% of net revenues, in 2014 compared to $47,690, or 1.2% of net revenues, in 2013 and $41,800, or 1.0% of net revenues, in 2012. program production costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method. program production cost amortization reflects the level of revenues associated with television programming as well as the type of television programs produced and distributed.
selling, distribution and administration expenses totaled $895,537, or 20.9% of net revenues, in 2014 compared to $871,679, or 21.3% of net revenues, in 2013 and $847,347, or 20.7% of net revenues, in 2012. selling, distribution and administration expense for 2014, 2013 and 2012 includes $6,094, $32,547 and $33,463, respectively, of charges related to restructuring activities, including the companys equity investment in the joint venture television network, and legal costs associated with the arbitration settlement. excluding these charges, selling, distribution and administration expense increased to $889,443, or 20.8% of net revenues, in 2014 from $839,132, or 20.6% of net revenues, in 2013 and $813,884, or 19.9% of net revenues, in 2012. higher selling, distribution and administration expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects continued investment in emerging markets and certain brands, primarily magic: the gathering, a full year of expense related to backflip, higher performance-based stock compensation and increased depreciation expense associated with investments in information systems. the increase in 2013 compared to 2012 reflected investments in emerging markets, information systems, new facilities, and certain brands, including magic: the gathering and the acquisition of backflip in the third quarter of 2013. higher compensation and legal expenses also contributed to the increase in 2013. these investments and higher costs in 2013 more than offset savings, primarily from headcount reductions, resulting from our cost savings initiatives.
interest expense interest expense totaled $93,098 in 2014 compared to $105,585 in 2013 and $91,141 in 2012. interest expense in 2013 included approximately $15,090 related to the settlement of an arbitration award. absent these charges, interest expense totaled $90,495 in 2013. the increase in interest expense in 2014 compared to the 2013 adjusted total was primarily due to higher benefits from interest rate swap agreements in 2013, partially offset by the benefit of lower interest rates on long-term debt.
interest income interest income was $3,759 compared to $4,925 in 2013 and $6,333 in 2012. decreased interest income in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects lower average cash balances while decreased interest income in 2013 compared to 2012 reflects lower average interest rates. average interest rates for 2014 and 2013 were consistent.
41
other (income) expense, net other expense, net totaled $6,048 in 2014 compared to $14,611 in 2013 and $13,575 in 2012. other expense, net in 2014 includes a net loss of $29,784 related to the restructuring of the companys television network joint venture. this net loss primarily consists of costs associated with an option agreement entered into between the company and discovery and the companys share of restructuring costs recorded by the network, partially offset by a gain resulting from the reduction of amounts due to discovery under a tax sharing agreement. other expense, net in 2014 also includes gains of $36,000 related to the sale of certain intellectual property license rights and $3,400 related to the sale of an internet domain name. excluding these items, other expense, net in 2014 would have increased to $15,664 in 2014 compared to $14,611 in 2013, primarily due to higher foreign exchange losses, partially offset by improved results from the companys share of the network. the increase in expense in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to higher net losses on foreign currency transactions and the impact of investment gains and losses.
foreign currency exchange net losses of $20,879 in 2014 compared to $5,159 in 2013 and $4,178 in 2012. the higher costs in 2014 resulted from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against most of the companys significant foreign currencies during the fourth quarter of 2014. excluding the net loss associated with the 2014 restructuring, the companys share of (earnings) loss of the network improved to a profit of $(7,840) in 2014 compared to a loss of $2,386 in 2013 and $6,015 in 2012.
income taxes income tax expense totaled 23.5% of pretax earnings in 2014 compared with 19.3% in 2013 and 25.9% in 2012. income tax expense for 2014 includes net benefits of approximately $20,000 from discrete events, primarily related to the effective settlement of certain open tax years in the united states and settlement of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions including mexico. income tax expense for 2013 includes net benefits of approximately $30,000 from discrete tax events, primarily related to the settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions, including the united states. income tax expense for 2012 includes net benefits of approximately $8,300 from discrete tax events, primarily related to the repatriation of certain highly taxed foreign earnings and to expirations of statutes of limitations in multiple jurisdictions. absent these items, potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions recorded in 2014, 2013 and 2012, and the impact of the 2013 charges related to restructuring activities, exit from certain product lines and settlement of the unfavorable arbitration award, the effective tax rates would have been 26.5%, 25.8% and 27.0%, respectively. the decrease in the adjusted tax rate from 2012 to 2013 and increase from 2013 to 2014 primarily reflect the change in the geographic mix of where the company earned its profits.
other information in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb), in cooperation with the international accounting standards board (iasb), issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (asc 606). this asu supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in accounting standards codification 605 revenue recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the codification. this new guidance provides a five-step model for analyzing contracts and transactions to determine when, how and if revenue is recognized. revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. the company is evaluating the requirements of asu 2014-09 and its potential impact on the companys financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations. in 2014 the company funded its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations, and, when needed, using borrowings under its available lines of credit and its commercial paper program. during 2015, the company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations and, when
42
needed, by issuing commercial paper or borrowing under its revolving credit agreement. in the event that the company is not able to issue commercial paper, the company intends to utilize its available lines of credit. the company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or its available lines of credit are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2015, however, unexpected events or circumstances such as material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures, or inability to otherwise access the commercial paper market, may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. in addition, significant disruptions to credit markets may also reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. although the company believes the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to its financial facilities is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to the company.
in may 2014, the company issued $600,000 in long-term debt which consists of $300,000 in 3.15% notes due 2021 and $300,000 in 5.10% notes due 2044 (collectively, the notes). the company may redeem the notes at its option at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments using the effective interest rate on applicable u.s. treasury bills at the time of repurchase. the proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used, primarily, to repay $425,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 6.125% notes due 2014 upon maturity, including accrued and unpaid interest. the remaining net proceeds were utilized for general corporate and working capital purposes.
as of december 28, 2014 the companys cash and cash equivalents totaled $893,167, a substantial portion of which is held by international subsidiaries outside of the united states. deferred income taxes have not been provided on the majority of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company. accordingly, such international cash balances are not available to fund cash requirements in the united states unless the company changes its reinvestment policy. the company has sufficient sources of cash in the united states to fund cash requirements without the need to repatriate any funds. if the company changes its policy of permanently reinvesting international earnings, it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries. if the company repatriated the funds from its international subsidiaries, it would then be required to pay the additional u.s. income tax. the majority of the companys cash and cash equivalents held outside of the united states as of december 28, 2014 is denominated in the u.s. dollar.
at december 28, 2014, cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings, were $640,686 compared to $674,117 and $625,336 at december 29, 2013 and december 30, 2012, respectively. hasbro generated $454,411, $401,132 and $534,796 of cash from its operating activities in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. operating cash flows in 2014, 2013 and 2012 included $31,424, $41,325 and $59,277, respectively, of cash used for television program production. cash from operations in 2013 and 2012 includes long-term royalty advance payments of $25,000 made to hub network in each of those two years. 2014 and 2013 also includes payments totaling approximately $60,000 and $175,000, respectively, of royalty advances paid to disney related to license agreements for marvel and star wars.
accounts receivable, net was flat at december 28, 2014 at $1,094,673 compared to $1,093,620 at december 29, 2013. the accounts receivable balance at december 28, 2014 includes a decrease of approximately $111,900 resulting from the translation of foreign currency. absent the impact of foreign exchange, accounts receivable, net increased 10% in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2014, excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation, of 7% compared to 2013. days sales outstanding decreased to 76 days at december 28, 2014 from 77 days at december 29, 2013. accounts receivable, net increased to $1,093,620 at december 29, 2013 from $1,029,959 at december 30, 2012. the accounts receivable balance at december 29, 2013 includes a decrease of approximately $17,000 resulting from the translation of foreign currency. absent the impact of foreign exchange, increased accounts receivable, net primarily reflects the growth in fourth quarter net revenues in the international segment in 2013. days sales outstanding increased to 77 days at december 29, 2013 from 72 days at december 30, 2012, primarily due to the impact of higher balances in certain international markets which have longer payment terms.
43
inventories decreased to $339,572 at december 28, 2014 from $348,794 at december 29, 2013. the inventory balance at december 28, 2014 includes a decrease of approximately $35,700 resulting from foreign currency translation. absent the impact of foreign currency translation, inventories grew 8% compared to 2013. inventory in the international segment increased approximately 32% absent foreign currency translation reflecting growth in the international segment, including emerging markets. higher inventories in the international segment were partially offset by lower inventories in the u.s. and canada segment, which declined 23%. inventories increased approximately 12% in 2013 from $316,049 at december 30, 2012 inclusive of a decrease of approximately $4,400 resulting from foreign currency translation. inventory in the international segment increased approximately 16%, primarily due to higher balances in emerging markets, including russia and brazil, supporting growth experienced in these markets. inventory in the u.s. and canada segment increased 2% in 2013 compared to 2012.
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to $391,688 at december 28, 2014 from $355,594 at december 29, 2013. the prepaid expenses and other current assets balance at december 28, 2014 includes a decrease of approximately $11,300 resulting from the translation of foreign currency. absent the impact of foreign exchange, prepaid expenses and other current assets increased approximately 13% compared to 2013, primarily due to higher favorable balances related to foreign currency hedging contracts and increased prepaid income taxes. these increases were only partially offset by lower prepaid royalties, primarily related to marvel, and lower deferred income taxes. prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to $355,594 at december 29, 2013 from $312,493 at december 30, 2012. higher prepaid royalties, primarily related to the companys amended agreements with disney related to its marvel and star wars licenses, contributed to increased balances in 2013 compared to 2012. prepaid expenses and other current assets also included approximately $3,200 related to a forward-starting interest rate swap contract which hedged future interest payments of the may 2014 debt issuance. these increases were partially offset by lower non-income based tax receivables, primarily value added taxes in europe, compared to 2012 as a result of collections in 2013.
other assets decreased approximately 8% to $657,587 at december 28, 2014 from $715,227 at december 29, 2013. the balance at december 28, 2014 includes a decrease of approximately $9,900 resulting from the translation of foreign currencies. absent translation, the decrease primarily relates to the partial sale of the companys investment in the network and, to a lesser extent, lower long-term prepaid royalties which have been reclassified from non-current to current or have been earned. these decreases were partially offset by higher favorable balances related to foreign currency hedging contracts and higher deferred income taxes relating to higher pension liabilities and the partial sale of the companys investment in the network. other assets increased to $715,227 at december 29, 2013 from $695,187 at december 30, 2012. the increase in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily reflects higher long-term prepaid royalties related to the companys amended agreements with disney for star wars and marvel licenses. these increases were only partially offset by lower television programming assets and lower deferred income taxes relating to lower pension liabilities in 2013 compared to 2012.
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased approximately 11% to $822,453 at december 28, 2014 from $926,558 at december 29, 2013. the balance at december 28, 2014 included a decrease of approximately $18,900 resulting from the translation of foreign currencies. the decrease was primarily due to lower accrued royalties and accrued interest, primarily resulting from the payment amounts accrued at the end of 2013 related to the settlement of an adverse arbitration award as well as lower accrued severance due to scheduled payments. accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $926,558 at december 29, 2013 from $736,070 at december 30, 2012. the balance includes a decrease of approximately $6,300 resulting from the translation of foreign currency. higher accrued royalties, interest and dividends as well as higher accounts payable contributed to the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2013 compared to 2012. these increases included accrued royalties of $42,950 and accrued interest of $15,090 related to the settlement of an adverse arbitration award. higher accrued dividends reflected a decision by the companys board in 2012 to accelerate the payment of the dividend declared in december 2012 from february 2013 to december 2012. as such, there were no accrued dividends at december 30, 2012.
44
other liabilities increased to $388,919 at december 28, 2014 from $351,304 at december 29, 2013. the balance at december 28, 2014 includes a decrease of approximately $13,700 resulting from the translation of foreign currency. the increase in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects higher pension liabilities primarily due to changes in actuarial assumptions, including a lower discount rate and updated mortality tables. in addition, the amended relationship between the company and discovery resulted in a net increase to other liabilities of approximately $10,700 reflecting the fair value of an option agreement related to the companys equity interest in the network, partially offset by a reduction in the amounts due to discovery related to a tax sharing agreement. these increases were partially offset by lower liabilities related to uncertain tax positions reflecting the settlement of tax examinations in 2014 primarily related to the united states and mexico. in connection with the settlement of tax assessments and years subject to audit from 2000 through 2013 in mexico, the company paid approximately $65,000 during the fourth quarter of 2014. other liabilities of $352,304 at december 29, 2013 decreased from $461,152 at december 30, 2012. the decrease in 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to lower liabilities related to pension and uncertain tax positions. the decline in liabilities related to uncertain tax positions is primarily due to the settlement of tax examinations during 2013, partially offset by additions for current year activity. the decline in pension liabilities is primarily due to increased discount rates, and, to a lesser extent, increased benefit payments due to a higher level of retirements during 2013 resulting from an early retirement program in the united states relating to the cost savings initiative.
cash flows utilized by investing activities were $485, $217,743 and $106,172 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. additions to property, plant and equipment were relatively consistent at $113,388, $112,031 and $112,091 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. of these additions, 60% in 2014, 51% in 2013 and 45% in 2012 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the companys products. in 2015, the company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $120,000 to $140,000. during the three years ended december 28, 2014, the depreciation of plant and equipment was $105,258, $102,799 and $99,718, respectively. fluctuations in depreciation of plant and equipment correlate with the percentage of additions to property, plant and equipment relating to tools, dies and molds which have shorter useful lives and accelerated depreciation. the 2014 utilization is almost wholly offset by $64,400 of cash received from discovery from the partial sale of the companys equity interest in the network and $36,000 of cash received from the sale of certain intellectual property licensing rights which was included in other investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. the higher utilization in 2013 reflects the companys acquisition of a majority stake in backflip for $109,955, net of cash acquired, as well as a payment related to an existing intellectual property. no investments or acquisitions were made in 2012.
the company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season. accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in their holiday selling season. due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. this timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary for the company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part of the year. during 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company primarily used cash from operations and borrowings under its commercial paper program and available lines of credit.
the company has an agreement with a group of banks which provides for a commercial paper program (the program). under the program, at the request of the company and subject to market conditions, the banks may either purchase from the company, or arrange for the sale by the company, of unsecured commercial paper notes. the company may issue notes from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $700,000. the maturities of the notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days. the notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount to par, or alternatively, sold at par and bear varying interest rates based on a fixed or floating rate basis. the interest rates vary based on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the notes by the credit rating agencies at the time of issuance. borrowings under the program are supported by the companys $700,000 revolving credit agreement. at december 28, 2014, the company had approximately $240,000 in borrowings outstanding related to the program.
45
the company has a revolving credit agreement (the agreement) which provides the company with a $700,000 committed borrowing facility. the agreement contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens, mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. the company was in compliance with all covenants in the agreement as of and for the fiscal year ended december 28, 2014. the company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at december 28, 2014. however, letters of credit outstanding under this facility as of december 28, 2014 were approximately $900. amounts available and unused under the committed line at december 28, 2014 were approximately $459,100, inclusive of borrowings under the companys commercial paper program. the company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which approximately $28,500 was utilized at december 28, 2014. of the amount utilized under, or supported by, the uncommitted lines, approximately $12,500 and $19,800 represent outstanding short-term borrowings and letters of credit, respectively.
net cash utilized by financing activities was $230,956, $341,009 and $219,379 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the 2014 utilization includes net proceeds from the issuance and repayment of long-term debt totaling $134,986. in 2014, the company issued an aggregate $600,000 in long-term notes which were partially utilized to re-pay the $425,000 in long-term notes due in may 2014. of the amounts utilized in 2014, 2013 and 2012, $459,564, $103,488 and $98,005 reflects cash paid, including transaction costs, to repurchase the companys common stock, respectively. during 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company repurchased 8,490, 2,268 and 2,694 shares at an average price of $54.26, $45.17 and $37.11, respectively. at december 28, 2014, $64,151 remained under outstanding board authorizations. dividends paid were $216,855 in 2014 compared to $156,129 in 2013 and $225,464 in 2012. dividends paid in 2012 include an additional dividend payment resulting from a decision by the companys board to accelerate the payment of the dividend declared in december 2012, which historically would have been paid in february 2013, to december 2012. this acceleration resulted in one less quarterly dividend paid in 2013. further, the company has increased its quarterly dividend rate from $0.36 in 2012 to $0.40 in 2013 and $0.43 in 2014. lastly, proceeds from other short-term borrowings of $246,054 and $43,016 in 2014 and 2012, respectively, compared to repayments of other short-term borrowings of $215,273 in 2013. the company generated cash from employee stock option transactions of $60,519, $118,122 and $54,963 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
for the $350,000 in notes due in 2017 which bear interest at 6.30%, interest rates may be adjusted upward in the event that the companys credit rating from moodys investor services, inc., standard & poors ratings services or fitch ratings is reduced to ba1, bb+, or bb+, respectively, or below. at december 28, 2014, the companys ratings from moodys investor services, inc., standard & poors ratings services and fitch ratings were baa2, bbb and bbb+, respectively. the interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the companys ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum of 2.00%. the company may redeem the notes at its option at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the effective interest rate on applicable u.s. treasury bills at the time of repurchase.
including the notes described above, the company has principal amounts of long-term debt at december 28, 2014 of approximately $1,559,895 due at varying times from 2017 through 2044. the company also had letters of credit and other similar instruments of $167,117 and purchase commitments of $295,244 outstanding at december 28, 2014. letters of credit and similar instruments include $146,410 of bonds related to tax assessments for transfer pricing issues in mexico which were settled during december 2014. these bonds are expected to be cancelled during the first quarter of 2015. in addition, the company is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments of approximately $107,238 in 2015.
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. as such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
46
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the companys reported financial results include sales allowances, program production costs, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments, pension costs and obligations and income taxes.
sales allowances sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized. revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment. revenue from product sales, less related sales allowances along with license fees and royalty revenue comprise net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers. these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year. discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation.
for its allowance programs that are not fixed, such as returns, the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions. these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues. during 2014, there have been no material adjustments to the companys estimates made in prior years.
program production costs the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs based primarily on the companys toy and game brands, including animated and live-action programs and game shows. these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method, whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program. these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value, and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist. the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on managements future revenue and cost estimates.
the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individual-film-forecast method. ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the television program and include toy, game and other merchandise licensing fees; first run program distribution fees; and other revenue sources, such as dvd and digital distribution. our ultimate revenue estimates for each television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results. we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. when estimates for a television program are revised, the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year, are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates. factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our television programs in the u.s. which are distributed on discovery family channel, globally to other broadcasters and available on netflix and itunes, and success of our program-related toy, game and other merchandise.
for the year ended december 28, 2014 we have $68,190 of program production costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. we currently expect that substantially all capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3-year period 2015 through 2017. future program production cost

amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and managements then current estimates of ultimate revenues. during 2014 and 2013 the company recorded accelerated amortization on certain television programming based on revised ultimate expected revenues.
recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the company will perform an interim test at that time. the company may perform a qualitative assessment and bypass the quantitative two-step impairment process if it is not more likely than not that impairment exists.
performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill requires a high degree of judgment regarding assumptions underlying the valuation. qualitative factors and their impact on critical inputs are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if it is more likely than not that impairment exists, the quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test is performed. when performing the quantitative two-step impairment test, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is calculated using an income approach. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. during the fourth quarter of 2014, the company performed a qualitative assessment with respect to certain of its reporting units with goodwill totaling $474,327. the company utilized this approach for all reporting units with the exception of backflip based on the amount by which historical estimated reporting unit fair values exceeded carrying values. based on its qualitative assessment, the company concluded that there was no impairment of this goodwill during 2014. the company has $119,111 of goodwill related to its 2013 acquisition of backflip, which represents a separate reporting unit. because backflip was a recent acquisition, the company performed the quantitative two-step impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2014 for this reporting unit and concluded that there was no impairment as the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value. backflips impairment test utilized cash flows expected to be generated from mobile gaming offerings, including releases based on existing backflip and hasbro game titles, as well as a discount rate commensurate with the emerging digital landscape. the underlying cash flows are based on long-term financial plans for backflip, which include projections for growth in revenues and profitability. should backflip not achieve its profitability and growth targets, the carrying value of this reporting unit may become impaired.
the company also performed quantitative two-step annual impairment tests related to intangible assets totaling $75,738 with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of 2014 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values of the related assets.
the estimation of future cash flows utilized in the evaluation of the companys goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge.
intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment
48
and result in an impairment charge. the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. intangible assets covered under this policy were $248,790 at december 28, 2014. during 2014, there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets.
recoverability of royalty advances and commitments the companys ability to earn-out royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to write-off the non-recoverable minimum guaranty is required. the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. at december 28, 2014, the company had $230,840 of prepaid royalties, $132,146 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $98,694 of which are included in other assets. during 2014 there were no significant charges related to this policy.
pension costs and obligations pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates. at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the u.s., with no future benefits accruing to employees. the company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze. the company uses its fiscal year-end date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year.
the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes, and the current economic environment. based on this information, the companys estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2014 pension expense for the u.s. plans was 7.00%. a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense. a decrease of 0.25% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2014 pension expense for u.s. plans by approximately $660.
discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. the companys weighted average discount rate for its u.s. plans used for the calculation of 2014 pension expense was 5.02%. a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. a decrease of 0.25% in the companys discount rate would have increased 2014 pension expense by approximately $460.
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over future periods and, therefore affect recognized expense in future periods. at december 28, 2014, the companys u.s. plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of $123,968 included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to $69,716 at december 28, 2013. the increase primarily reflects unrecognized actuarial losses in 2014 compared to gains in 2013, due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan obligations at december 28, 2014 as well as utilization of updated mortality tables which reflect increased life expectancy. the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december 28, 2014 decreased to 4.19% from 5.02% used at december 29, 2013. a decrease of 0.25% in the companys discount rate would have increased the 2014 projected benefit obligation by
49
approximately $12,175. pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date. these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains.
income taxes the companys annual income tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates, changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the companys annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. despite the companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable, these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges. these estimated liabilities are adjusted, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit.
an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the companys interim results. in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the companys interim results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time. in addition, changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year, or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs. during 2014 and 2013, the company recorded a net benefit of approximately $20,000 and $30,000, respectively, associated with discrete tax events, primarily related to the completion of u.s. and mexico tax examinations as well as certain other u.s. and foreign prior period tax adjustments. during 2014 the company paid approximately $65,000 to settle tax assessments and years subject to audit from 2000 through 2013 in mexico. the company incurred additional tax expense in 2014 of $6,910 related to this settlement.
in certain cases, tax law requires items to be included in the companys income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the consolidated financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the consolidated financial statements. some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the companys tax returns, while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the companys income tax returns. valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income, including capital gains, to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses. deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the companys income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the companys consolidated financial statements or income recognized in the consolidated financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the companys income tax return. deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as most of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company. in the event the company determines that such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested, it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries. at december 28, 2014, the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries on cumulative undistributed earnings was approximately $513,000.

contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the normal course of its business, the company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment. in addition, the company has $1,559,895 in principal amount of long-term debt outstanding at december 28, 2014. future payments required under these and other obligations as of december 28, 2014 are as follows:
payments due by fiscal year certain contractual obligations                          2015                     2016                  2017                  2018                  2019                      thereafter                  total long-term debt                                               $                                                350,000                                                             1,209,895                1,559,895

included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 28, 2014, the company has a liability, including potential interest and penalties, of $39,458 for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns. the company does not know the ultimate resolution for remaining uncertain tax positions and as such, does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability. accordingly, these amounts are not included in the table above.
in connection with the companys agreement to form a joint venture with discovery, the company is obligated to make future payments to discovery under a tax sharing agreement. these payments are contingent upon the company having sufficient taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related to the joint venture. accordingly, estimates of these amounts are included in the table above.
in july 2013, the company acquired a 70% stake in backflip and will be required to purchase the remaining 30% in the future contingent on the achievement by backflip of certain predetermined financial performance metrics. the company does not know the ultimate timing that these predetermined financial performance metrics may be met and, thereby, cannot currently estimate the purchase price of the remaining 30%.
the table above excludes up to $110,000 in guaranteed royalties related to the companys license agreement with disney related to marvel as such amounts are contingent on the quantity and type of theatrical movie releases and may be payable during the next six years. approximately $40,000 of these additional royalties are expected to be paid in 2015 based on expected qualifying theatrical releases.
the table above also excludes $150,000 in guaranteed royalties related to the companys license agreement with disney related to star wars as the amount and timing of such payments are due in accordance with the anticipated releases of new star wars theatrical releases. the company expects to pay $50,000 in 2015 based on the anticipated theatrical release of star wars: the force awakens in december 2015.
purchase commitments represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase inventory and tooling in the ordinary course of business. the reported amounts exclude inventory and tooling purchase liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 28, 2014.
in addition to the amounts included in the table above, the company expects to make contributions totaling approximately $4,000 related to its unfunded u.s. and other international pension plans in 2015. the company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately $167,117 at december 28, 2014. letters of credit and
51
related instruments include bonds of approximately $146,410 related to tax assessments in mexico which were settled in december 2014. the company expects these bonds to be cancelled during the first quarter of 2015.
the company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above.
financial risk management the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in u.s. dollars, hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies. results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the u.s. dollar, hong kong dollar, euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, brazilian real, russian ruble and mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, other currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries.
to manage this exposure, the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts. the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation of the u.s. dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate $74,700 decrease in the fair value of these instruments. a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions.
the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term borrowing positions in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company believes, however, that the on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. in addition, the companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the companys revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign-denominated revenues and expenses. the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange. from time to time, affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts.
the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets. the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. at december 28, 2014, these contracts had net unrealized gains of $65,937, of which $35,086 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, $34,062 are recorded in other assets, and ($2,591) are recorded in accrued liabilities. included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 28, 2014 are deferred gains of $64,200, net of tax, related to these derivatives.
at december 28, 2014, the company had fixed rate long-term debt of $1,559,895. of this long-term debt, $600,000 represents the aggregate issuance of long-term debt in may 2014 which consists of $300,000 of 3.15% notes due 2021 and $300,000 of 5.10% notes due 2044. during the fourth quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2014, the company entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of $500,000 to hedge the anticipated underlying u.s. treasury interest rate associated with the may 2014 debt issuance. these interest rate swaps were matched with this debt issuance and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in future interest payments. at the date of issuance, the company terminated these swap agreements and their fair value at the date of issuance, $33,306, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method over the life of the related debt. included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 28, 2014 are deferred losses, net of tax, of $20,511 related to these derivatives.
the economy and inflation the principal market for the companys products is the retail sector. revenues from the companys top five customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 38% of its consolidated net revenues in 2014 and 39% and 42% of its consolidated net revenues in 2013 and 2012, respectively. the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate.
52
the companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. in 2014, approximately 65% of the companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year. the company expects that this concentration will continue. the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items, and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season, which includes christmas.
quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment. retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers. to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the companys future revenues. in addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the companys significant retailers could negatively impact the companys future revenues.
the effect of inflation on the companys operations during 2014 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.
other information the company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including the factors we describe under "special note regarding forward-looking statements", "risk factors" and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
references in the following discussion to "we", "our", "us", "dps" or "the company" refer to dr pepper snapple group, inc. and all entities included in our audited consolidated financial statements. cadbury plc and cadbury schweppes plc are hereafter collectively referred to as "cadbury", unless otherwise indicated. kraft foods inc. acquired cadbury on february 2, 2010.
on october 1, 2012, kraft foods, inc. spun-off its north american grocery business to its shareholders and changed its name to mondelēz international, inc. ("mondelēz").
the periods presented in this section are the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, which we refer to as "2014", "2013" and "2012", respectively.
overview we are a leading integrated brand owner, manufacturer and distributor of non-alcoholic beverages in the u.s., canada and mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored csds and ncbs, including ready-to-drink teas, juices, juice drinks, water and mixers. our brand portfolio includes popular csd brands such as dr pepper, sunkist soda, 7up, a&w, canada dry, crush, squirt, peñafiel and schweppes, and ncb brands such as snapple, mott's, hawaiian punch, clamato, rose's and mr & mrs t mixers. our largest brand, dr pepper, is a leading flavored csd in the u.s. according to nielsen. we have some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america, with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers.
we operate as an integrated brand owner, manufacturer and distributor through our three segments. we believe our integrated business model strengthens our route-to-market and provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses through both our dsd system and our wd delivery system. our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage.
we operate primarily in the u.s., mexico and canada and we also distribute our products in the caribbean. in 2014, 88% of our net sales were generated in the u.s., 4% in canada and 8% in mexico and the caribbean.
uncertainties and trends affecting our business we believe the north american lrb market is influenced by certain key trends and uncertainties. some of these items, such as increased health consciousness and changes in economic factors, have created continued category headwinds for our csds during the year ended december 31, 2014 and have unfavorably impacted our sales volumes, excluding the impact of recent product innovations and acquisitions, compared to the prior year. the key trends and uncertainties that could affect our business include:
•   increased health consciousness. consumers are increasingly becoming more concerned about health and wellness, focusing on caloric intake and sugar content in both regular csds and juices and the use of artificial sweeteners in diet csds. we believe the main beneficiaries of this trend include naturally sweetened, low calorie drinks, all natural and organic beverages, ready-to-drink teas and bottled waters.
•   increased government regulation. government agencies, as a result of concerns about the public health consequences and health care costs associated with obesity, have been proposing and, in some cases, enacting new taxes or regulations on sugar-sweetened beverages. any changes of regulations or imposed taxes could reduce demand and/or cause us to raise our prices.
24
•   changes in consumer preferences. we are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs. we believe marketing and product innovations that target fast growing population segments, such as the hispanic community in the u.s., could drive market growth. additionally, as more consumers are faced with a busy and on-the-go lifestyle, sales of single-serve beverages could increase, which typically have higher margins.
•   increased competition in the lrb market. a number of our competitors are large corporations with significant financial resources. these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities, which could reduce the demand for our products.
•   product and packaging innovation. we believe brand owners and bottling companies will continue to create new products and packages, such as beverages with new ingredients and new premium flavors and innovative convenient packaging, that address changes in consumer tastes and preferences.
•   changing retailer landscape. as retailers continue to consolidate, we believe retailers will support consumer product companies that can provide an attractive portfolio of products, a strong value proposition and efficient delivery.
•   volatility in the costs of raw materials. the costs of a substantial portion of the raw materials used in the beverage industry are dependent on commodity prices for aluminum, corn, resin, diesel, natural gas, pulp and other commodities. we are also dependent on commodity prices for apples related to our applesauce production. commodity price volatility has, from time to time, exerted pressure on industry margins and operating results.
as a result of these uncertainties and other factors, we believe net sales for the year ending december 31, 2015 could be up approximately 1% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. commodity costs for the year ending december 31, 2015 could be down approximately 1% on a constant volume/mix basis as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.
refer to item 1a, "risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company.
seasonality the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations. our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations.
segments we report our business in three operating segments:
•   the beverage concentrates segment reflects sales of our branded concentrates and syrup to third party bottlers primarily in the u.s. and canada. most of the brands in this segment are csd brands.
•   the packaged beverages segment reflects sales in the u.s. and canada from the manufacture and distribution of finished beverages and other products, including sales of our own brands and third party brands, through both dsd and wd.
•   the latin america beverages segment reflects sales in the mexico, caribbean and other international markets from the manufacture and distribution of concentrates, syrup and finished beverages.
segment results are based on management reports. net sales and sop are the significant financial measures used to assess the operating performance of our operating segments.
volume in evaluating our performance, we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates or finished beverages.
beverage concentrates sales volume in our beverage concentrates segment, we measure our sales volume in two ways: (1) "concentrate case sales" and (2) "bottler case sales." the unit of measurement for both concentrate case sales and bottler case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage, the equivalent of 24 twelve ounce servings.
25
concentrate case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors. a concentrate case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage. it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate. our net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on our sales of concentrate cases.
although net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on concentrate case sales, we believe that bottler case sales are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales of packaged beverages into retail channels.
packaged beverages sales volume in our packaged beverages segment, we measure volume as case sales to customers. a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us. case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to and/or distributed by us.
volume in bottler case sales in addition to sales volume, we measure volume in bottler case sales ("volume (bcs)") as sales of packaged beverages, in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases, sold by us and our bottling partners to retailers and independent distributors. our contract manufacturing sales are not included or reported as part of volume (bcs).
bottler case sales and concentrates and packaged beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels, which can be affected by seasonality, bottler inventory and manufacturing practices and the timing of price increases and new product introductions.

volume (bcs). volume (bcs) increased 1% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. in the u.s. and canada, volume was flat, and in mexico and the caribbean, volume increased 5%, compared with the year ago period. branded csd volume increased 1% while branded ncb volume declined 1%.
in branded csds, peñafiel grew 21% in our latin america beverages segment as a result of product and package innovation. our core 4 brands increased 2% compared to the year ago period, driven by an 8% increase in canada dry partially offset by a 1% decline in 7up. a&w and sunkist soda were both flat for the period. schweppes grew 10% reflecting distribution gains in our seltzer water and growth in the ginger ale category. these gains were partially offset by a 2% decrease in dr pepper, driven primarily by declines in our diet products, and a 5% decrease in our other csd brands in total. crush, squirt and rc cola declined 1%, 1% and 2%, respectively.
in branded ncbs, decreases were driven by a 7% decrease in hawaiian punch as a result of category declines and increased competitive activity, a 1% decline in our other ncb brands in total, and a 1% decrease in mott's as a result of declines in apple sauce. the decline was partially offset by a 7% increase in clamato, driven by increased promotional activity, and 3% growth in our water category primarily driven by new distribution arrangements for bai 5 and sparkling fruit2o and distribution gains in fiji and vita coco. snapple increased 1% for the current period as growth in our higher margin snapple premium products was partially offset by our de-emphasis on our value products.
28
net sales. net sales increased $124 million, or approximately 2%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. the primary drivers of the increase were favorable product and package mix, increased branded sales volume, higher pricing driven by the mexican sugar tax and an increase in contract manufacturing. these drivers were partially offset by $35 million in unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher discounts, driven primarily by the annual true-up of our prior year estimated customer liability.
gross profit. gross profit increased $132 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. gross margin was 59.3% and 58.3% for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the drivers of the favorable change in gross margin were lower commodity costs, net of the change in our last-in, first-out ("lifo") inventory provision, ongoing productivity improvements and mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts, which increased gross margin 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. these drivers were partially offset by unfavorable product, package and segment mix, the net impact of the mexican sugar tax, unfavorable foreign currency effects and an increase in other manufacturing costs, which decreased gross margin by 0.5%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.2%, respectively.
the favorable mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $11 million in unrealized gains versus $15 million in unrealized losses in the prior year. the unfavorable comparison in our lifo inventory provision was the result of a $3 million increase in the provision for the year ended december 31, 2014 versus a $39 million decrease in the provision for the year ended december 31, 2013 driven primarily by apple prices.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses increased $62 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the prior year. the increase was primarily driven by the following items:
•   increased people costs, primarily driven by performance-based incentive compensation;
•   a $23 million unfavorable comparison in the mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts;
•   higher logistics costs from our third party carriers partially driven by tighter than expected overall system capacity; and
•   pension settlement charges of $16 million, of which $14 million related to the purchase of annuities for certain participants receiving benefits in our u.s. defined benefit pension plans.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized $24 million in unrealized losses related to the mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts versus $1 million in unrealized losses in the year ago period.
these items were partially offset by a planned reduction of $13 million for our marketing investments, the favorable impact of foreign currency and the favorable comparison of the $7 million in workforce reduction costs related to certain restructuring activities in the prior year.
multi-employer pension plan withdrawal. we recognized a non-cash charge of $56 million related to our withdrawal from local 710 during the year ended december 31, 2013. refer to note 14 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information on this charge.
income from operations. income from operations increased $134 million to $1,180 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, due primarily to the increase in gross profit and the favorable comparison to the non-cash charge for the multi-employer pension plan withdrawal taken in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in our sg&a expenses.
interest expense. interest expense decreased $14 million, or approximately 11%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared with the year ago period primarily due to the favorable impact of our fair value hedges and the repayment of our 6.12% senior unsecured notes in may 2013 (the "2013 notes").
other expense (income), net and (benefit) provision for income taxes. through the second quarter of 2013, we recorded indemnification income from mondelēz under the tax indemnity agreement as other expense, net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. due to the completion of the irs audit for our 2006-2008 federal income tax returns in august 2013, we recognized an income tax benefit of $463 million primarily related to decreasing our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and $430 million of other expense, net, as we no longer anticipate collecting amounts from mondelēz. in june 2013, a bill was enacted by the canadian government, which reduced amounts amortized for income tax purposes. we recognized $38 million of indemnity income due to the reduction of our long-term liability to mondelēz and $50 million of income tax expense for the reduction of our tax assets.

the following table excludes these amounts discussed above from our other expense (income), net, income before provision (benefit) for income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and provision (benefit) for income taxes lines within our consolidated statements of income. we have presented this table as we believe the effect of those items on these lines and on our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 are not meaningful as reported.

net sales. net sales decreased $1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease was due to higher discounts and unfavorable foreign currency translation, largely offset by an increase in concentrate prices, a slight increase in sales volumes and higher licensing revenue. the higher discounts were primarily driven by the annual true-up of our prior year estimated customer liability.
sop. sop increased $12 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared with the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily driven by decreases in sg&a expenses and favorability in cost of sales. the decrease in cost of sales was primarily driven by lower commodity costs, led by sweeteners, and ongoing productivity improvements, partially offset by an unfavorable lifo comparison of $3 million and higher costs associated with increased sales volumes. the decrease in sg&a expenses was the result of $15 million in planned lower marketing investments, partially offset by increased people costs.
volume (bcs).  volume (bcs) was flat for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. dr pepper decreased 2%, driven primarily by declines in our diet products. our other brands decreased 10%, primarily due to the discontinuation of welch's. these decreases were partially offset by growth in schweppes, our core 4 brands and crush. schweppes had a 10% increase driven by distribution gains in our seltzer water and growth in the ginger ale category. our core 4 brands increased 3% compared to the prior year as a result of a 6% increase in canada dry and 3% increase in sunkist soda partially offset by a 4% decrease in 7up and a 1% decline in a&w. crush grew 1% for the current year.

volume. branded csd volumes increased 1% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. volume for our core 4 brands increased 2% compared to the prior year period, led by a 11% increase in canada dry, partially offset by a 2% decline in sunkist soda. 7up and a&w volumes were flat in the current year. squirt increased 7% compared to the prior year period due to higher promotional activity and package innovation. rc cola increased 6%. our other csd brands increased 1% in the current year. these increases were partially offset by a 2% decrease in dr pepper, driven primarily by declines in our diet products.
branded ncb volumes decreased 1%, driven primarily by a 6% decline in hawaiian punch as a result of increased competitive activity and category declines. our other ncb brands decreased 2%, while mott's decreased 1% due to declines in apple sauce. these decreases were partially offset by a 12% increase in our water category and a 7% increase in clamato as a result of increased promotional activity. growth in our water category was primarily driven by new distribution arrangements for bai 5 and sparkling fruit2o and distribution gains in fiji and vita coco. snapple volumes were flat for the current period as growth in our higher margin snapple premium products was fully offset by our de-emphasis on our value products.
net sales. net sales increased $55 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. net sales increased due to favorable product mix, higher branded sales volumes, an increase in contract manufacturing and lower discounts, partially offset by increased promotional activity and unfavorable foreign currency translation.

sop. sop increased $111 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared with the year ended december 31, 2013 as a result of the favorable comparison to the $56 million multi-employer pension plan withdrawal recorded in the prior year and increases in net sales. increases in sg&a expenses were fully offset by a reduction in cost of sales.
cost of sales declined as favorable commodity costs, net of the $39 million unfavorable lifo comparison, and ongoing productivity improvements were partially offset by increased costs associated with product and package mix, increased costs associated with higher branded sales volumes and higher other manufacturing costs.
the unfavorable comparison in our lifo inventory provision was the result of a $2 million increase in the provision for the year ended december 31, 2014 versus a $37 million decrease in the provision for the year ended december 31, 2013 driven primarily by apple prices.
the increase in sg&a expenses for the current year were the result of the following significant drivers:
•   higher logistics costs from our third party carriers driven by tighter than expected overall transportation system capacity;
•   additional operating costs associated with the acquisitions of dp/7up west and davis; and
•   the $4 million unfavorable comparison of activity related to a case against the american bottling company ("abc litigation") as we recorded a $2 million decrease in our legal provision in the current year versus a $6 million reduction in our legal provision in the prior year.

net sales. net sales increased $70 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. net sales increased as a result of higher pricing driven by the impact of the mexican sugar tax, favorable mix and increased sales volume, partially offset by $19 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.
sop. sop increased $17 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013, driven by increases in net sales, partially offset by increases in cost of sales and sg&a expenses. cost of sales grew in the current year primarily as a result of the mexican sugar tax. other drivers of the change in cost of sales included higher costs associated with increased sales volumes and product and package mix, partially offset by lower commodity costs, led by packaging and sweeteners, and ongoing productivity improvements. sg&a expenses increased primarily due to higher logistics costs and increased people costs as a result of higher commissions, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation. the benefit of higher pricing was offset by increased costs due to the mexican sugar tax.

volume (bcs). volume (bcs) decreased 2% for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared with the year ended december 31, 2012. in the u.s. and canada, volume declined 2%, and in mexico and the caribbean, volume increased 3%, compared with the year ago period. both csd volume and ncb volume declined 2%.
in csds, volumes were unfavorably impacted by continued category headwinds which included increased consumer concerns about health and wellness. dr pepper volume declined 2%. our core 4 brands, which included the impact of the launch of our core 4 ten products, decreased 1% compared to the year ago period. this result was driven by a a 5% decrease in 7up, a 7% decline in sunkist soda and a 2% decrease in a&w, partially offset by a 6% increase in canada dry. crush, squirt and rc cola declined 7%, 4% and 4%, respectively. sun drop declined double-digits. other brands in total declined 3%. these decreases were partially offset by growth of 11% in peñafiel as a result of product and package innovation and a 6% increase in schweppes reflecting distribution gains in our seltzer water and growth in the ginger ale category.
in ncbs, decreases were driven by a 9% decrease in hawaiian punch as a result of lower promotional activity and declines within the category and an 8% decline in other brands. the decline was partially offset by a 2% increase in snapple as a result of package and product innovation and a 3% increase in mott's due to distribution gains in our juice and sauce categories. our water category increased 3%, led by aguafiel. clamato increased 6%.
net sales. net sales increased $2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared with the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase was attributable to favorable mix, net pricing increases and favorable foreign currency translation, substantially offset by lower branded sales volumes and an unfavorable comparison of trade adjustments.
33
gross profit. gross profit increased $3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared with the year ended december 31, 2012. gross margin was 58.3% for both years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012. significant activity within the gross margin included the $58 million favorable comparison in our lifo inventory provision, driven by the higher prices of apples in the prior year, and increases in our net price realization. these favorable changes were offset by increases in our commodity costs, led by apples and sweeteners, the $30 million unfavorable comparison for the mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts and unfavorable mix due to a higher mix of finished goods rather than concentrates, as well as package and product mix. the change in our lifo inventory provision for the year ended december 31, 2013 was a $39 million reduction in the provision versus a $19 million increase in the provision for the year ended december 31, 2012. the mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $15 million in unrealized losses versus $15 million in unrealized gains in the year ago period.
selling, general and administrative expenses. sg&a expenses increased $4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared with the prior period. the increase was primarily the result of $7 million in workforce reduction costs, incremental operating costs associated with the acquisition of certain assets of dp/7up west, increased marketing investments and the unfavorable comparison for the mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts. these increases were partially offset by lower labor and benefit costs, a $6 million favorable adjustment in 2013 to the legal provision associated with the abc litigation and lower logistics costs.
multi-employer pension plan withdrawal. we recognized a non-cash charge of $56 million related to our intention to withdraw from local 710. refer to note 14 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information on this charge.
income from operations. income from operations decreased $46 million to $1,046 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, principally due to the non-cash charge for the multi-employer pension plan withdrawal and an increase in sg&a expenses partially offset by the decline in depreciation and amortization driven by the favorable comparison to the $8 million depreciation adjustment recorded in the prior year.
other expense (income), net and (benefit) provision for income taxes. we have historically recorded indemnification income from mondelēz under the tax indemnity agreement as other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of income. due to the completion of the irs audit for our 2006-2008 federal income tax returns in august 2013, we recognized an income tax benefit of $463 million primarily related to decreasing our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and $430 million of other expense, net, as we no longer anticipate collecting amounts from mondelēz. additionally, in june 2013, a bill was enacted by the canadian government, which reduced amounts amortized for income tax purposes. as a result, we recognized $38 million of indemnity income due to the reduction of our long-term liability to mondelēz and $50 million of income tax expense for the reduction of our tax assets.
the following table excludes these amounts discussed above from our other expense (income), net, (loss) income before (benefit) provision for income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and (benefit) provision for income taxes lines within our consolidated statements of income. we have presented this table as we believe the effect of those items on these lines and on our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 are not meaningful as reported.

net sales. net sales increased $8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared with the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase was due to an increase in concentrate prices, favorable product mix and lower discounts, which were largely offset by a 4% decline in concentrate case sales.
sop. sop increased $4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared with the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily due to the gross margin impact of higher net sales and lower labor and benefit costs, partially offset by a higher transfer pricing allocation and $5 million of higher marketing investments.

volume (bcs). volume (bcs) decreased 2% as a result of continued category headwinds for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared with the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily driven by a 2% decline in dr pepper and a 7% decrease in crush. other drivers of the decline include a 7% decline in rc cola, a 6% decrease in sun drop and a 6% decline in squirt. these declines were partially offset by a 6% increase in schweppes reflecting distribution gains in our seltzer water and growth in the ginger ale category. our core 4 brands, which included the impact of the launch of our core 4 ten products, were flat compared to the prior year as a result of a 7% decline in sunkist soda, a 4% decrease in 7up and a 3% decline in a&w, offset by a 4% increase in canada dry.

volume. total sales volume decreased 3% for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared with the year ended december 31, 2012. lower ncb volumes, csd volumes and contract manufacturing each decreased our total segment sales volume by 1%.
within csds, volume declined 2% for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared with the year ended december 31, 2012, as a result of continued category headwinds. volume for our core 4 brands, which includes the impact of the launch of our core 4 ten products, decreased 1% for the year ended december 31, 2013, led by a 7% decline in sunkist soda, a 3% decrease in 7up and an 1% decline in a&w, partially offset by a double digit increase in canada dry. dr pepper volumes decreased 3% for the year ended december 31, 2013. sun drop declined by double-digits, while squirt declined 2%. our other brands decreased 6% for the year ended december 31, 2013. these declines were partially offset by a 3% increase in rc cola which included the launch of the rc ten product.
within ncbs, volume decreased 4%, driven primarily by a 10% decline in hawaiian punch as a result of declines within the category and lower promotional activity. our other brands decreased 8%, led by distribution losses in arizona. these decreases were partially offset by a 3% increase in mott's as a result of distribution gains in our juice and sauce categories and increased promotional activity, a 2% increase in our water category and a 2% increase in clamato. snapple was flat for the period.
net sales. net sales decreased $52 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared with the year ended december 31, 2012. net sales decreased due to a decline in our sales volumes and an unfavorable comparison of trade adjustments, which were partially offset by favorable mix and net pricing increases led by mott's.
sop. sop decreased $14 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared with the year ended december 31, 2012. the primary factors driving the decrease in sop included a $56 million non-cash charge related to our intention to withdraw from the local 710 multi-employer pension plan and higher commodity costs, led by apples, which were partially offset by a $56 million favorable comparison in our lifo inventory provision. other drivers of sop include the gross margin impact of lower net sales, partially offset by ongoing productivity improvements, lower labor and benefit costs, the favorable comparison to the $8 million depreciation adjustment recorded in the prior year, lower logistics costs and a $6 million favorable adjustment in 2013 to the legal provision associated with the abc litigation.

volume. sales volume increased 3% for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared with the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase in volume was led by a double-digit increase in peñafiel as a result of product and package innovation and a 6% increase in aguafiel due to increased promotional activity. clamato increased 8% while dr pepper increased by double-digits. our other brands in total increased 7%. these increases in sales volume were partially offset by a 4% decline in squirt as a result of higher pricing and inventory reductions by third party bottlers, a double-digit decline in 7up and a 5% decrease in crush.
net sales. net sales increased $46 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared with the year ended december 31, 2012. net sales increased as a result of favorable product mix, increased sales volumes and $12 million of favorable foreign currency translation.
sop. sop increased $10 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared with the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily due to the gross margin impact of favorable product mix, increased sales volumes and ongoing productivity improvements. these favorable drivers were partially offset by increases in people costs, marketing investments, other manufacturing costs, commodity costs, which were led by sweeteners, and higher logistics costs.
liquidity and capital resources trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by various risk factors discussed in item 1a, "risk factors", including recession or other economic downturn in the u.s., canada, mexico or the caribbean, which could result in a reduction in our sales volume. similarly, disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us, thus reducing our cash flow, or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials.
we believe that the following trends and uncertainties may also impact liquidity:
•   our continued repurchases of our outstanding common stock pursuant to our repurchase programs;
•   continued payment of dividends;
•   continued capital expenditures;
•   seasonality of our operating cash flows could impact short-term liquidity;
•   our ability to issue unsecured commercial paper notes ("commercial paper") on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $500 million;
•   acquisitions of regional bottling companies, distributors and distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage or access to new products; and
•   our ability to refinance $500 million of our outstanding 2.90% senior notes due january 15, 2016 (the "2016 notes"). we intend to issue senior notes to refinance the 2016 notes before the due date.

financing arrangements the following descriptions represent our available financing arrangements as of december 31, 2014. as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all covenant requirements for our senior unsecured notes, unsecured credit agreement and commercial paper program.
commercial paper program on december 10, 2010, we entered into a commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $500 million. the maturities of the commercial paper will vary, but may not exceed 364 days from the date of issuance. we issue commercial paper for general corporate purposes as commercial paper is now a more significant part of our overall cash management strategy. the program is supported by the revolver (as defined below). outstanding commercial paper reduces the amount of borrowing capacity available under the revolver and outstanding amounts under the revolver reduce the commercial paper availability. under this program, we had weighted average outstanding commercial paper of $67 million and $62 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively, with maturities of 90 days or less and a weighted average rate of 0.23% and 0.28% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, we had no commercial paper outstanding. we had $65 million of outstanding commercial paper as of december 31, 2013.
unsecured credit agreement on september 25, 2012, we entered into a five-year unsecured credit agreement (the "credit agreement"), which provides for a $500 million revolving line of credit (the "revolver"). borrowings under the revolver bear interest at a floating rate per annum based upon the alternate base rate ("abr") or the eurodollar rate, in each case plus an applicable margin which varies based upon our debt ratings. rates range from 0.000% to 0.300% for abr loans and from 0.795% to 1.300% for eurodollar loans. the abr is defined as the greater of (a) jpmorgan chase bank's prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.500% and (c) the adjusted libor for a one month interest period. the adjusted libor is the london interbank offered rate for dollars adjusted for a statutory reserve rate set by the board of governors of the u.s. federal reserve system.
additionally, the revolver is available for the issuance of letters of credit and swingline advances not to exceed $75 million and $50 million, respectively. swingline advances will accrue interest at a rate equal to the abr plus the applicable margin. letters of credit and swingline advances will reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis, the amount available under the revolver.
the following table provides amounts utilized and available under the revolver and each sublimit arrangement type as of december 31, 2014 (in millions):
amount utilized                  balances available revolver             $-                                    $499
letters of credit    1                                       74
swingline advances   -                                       50
the credit agreement further provides that we may request at any time, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, that the aggregate commitments under the facility be increased by a total amount not to exceed $250 million.
the credit agreement's representations, warranties, covenants and events of default are generally customary for investment grade credit and include a covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt (as defined in the credit agreement) to annualized consolidated ebitda (as defined in the credit agreement) of no more than 3.00 to 1.00, tested quarterly. upon the occurrence of an event of default, among other things, amounts outstanding under the credit agreement may be accelerated and the commitments may be terminated. our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries on the terms set forth in the credit agreement. the credit agreement has a maturity date of september 25, 2017; however, with the consent of lenders holding more than 50% of the total commitments under the credit agreement and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, we may extend the maturity date for up to two additional one-year terms.
an unused commitment fee is payable quarterly to the lenders on the unused portion of the commitments available under the revolver equal to 0.08% to 0.20% per annum, depending upon our debt ratings.

shelf registration statement on february 7, 2013, our board authorized us to issue up to $1,500 million of securities from time to time. subsequently, we filed a "well-known seasoned issuer" shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission, effective may 23, 2013, which registers an indeterminable amount of securities for future sales. as of december 31, 2014, we had not issued any securities under this shelf registration statement.
letters of credit facilities we currently have letters of credit facilities available in addition to the portion of the revolver reserved for issuance of letters of credit. under these incremental letters of credit facilities, $140 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit, $63 million of which was utilized as of december 31, 2014 and $77 million of which remains available for use.
liquidity based on our current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months. to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements, if necessary.
the following table summarizes our cash activity for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in millions):
for the year ended december 31,
2014                                                        2013              2012
net cash provided by operating activities      $1,022              $866              $482
net cash used in investing activities            (185   )          (195   )          (217   )
net cash used in financing activities            (747   )          (880   )          (603   )
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased $156 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to the increase in net income and the favorable working capital comparisons to the prior year.
net cash provided by operating activities increased $384 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily due to the favorable comparison of the 2012 tax payments of $531 million resulting from the licensing agreements with pepsico and coca-cola, partially offset by unfavorable working capital comparisons to the prior year.
net cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014, consisted primarily of purchases of property, plant and equipment of $170 million and $19 million paid in connection with the acquisition of davis. purchases of property, plant and equipment have decreased over the prior period in line with our focus on reducing our purchases, net of proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment, in an amount below 3.00% of our current year net sales.
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2013, consisted primarily of purchases of property, plant and equipment of $179 million and cash paid to liquidate the liabilities assumed and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of dp/7up west of $10 million. purchases of property, plant and equipment have decreased over the prior period in line with our focus on reducing our purchases, net of proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment, in an amount slightly below 3.00% of our net sales in 2013.

net cash used in financing activities
2014
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily consisted of stock repurchases of $400 million and dividend payments of $317 million.
2013
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily consisted of stock repurchases of $400 million and dividend payments of $302 million.
on may 1, 2013, we repaid $250 million of our 6.12% senior notes due may 1, 2013 at maturity.
2012
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2012 primarily consisted of stock repurchases of $400 million and dividend payments of $284 million.
on november 20, 2012, we completed the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.00% senior notes due january 15, 2020 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.70% senior notes due november 15, 2022.
on december 21, 2012, we repaid $450 million of our 2.35% senior notes due december 21, 2012 at maturity.
debt ratings as of december 31, 2014, our debt ratings were baa1 with a stable outlook from moody's and bbb+ with a stable outlook from s&p. our commercial paper ratings were p-2/a-2 from moody's and s&p, respectively.
these debt and commercial paper ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangements. a downgrade of one or both of our debt and commercial paper ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations.
cash management we fund our liquidity needs from cash flow from operations, cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements, as commercial paper is now a more significant part of our overall cash management strategy.
capital expenditures capital expenditures were $170 million, $179 million and $217 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. capital expenditures have reduced over the last three years as a result of a stronger focus on the return on our discretionary capital expenditures, the result of our rci initiatives and reduced infrastructure investments required after our separation from cadbury. capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily related to machinery and equipment including production improvements in our mexico facilities, our distribution fleet, it investments and expansion and replacement of existing cold drink equipment. for the year ended december 31, 2013, capital expenditures primarily related to machinery and equipment, it investments, expansion and replacement of existing cold drink equipment and our distribution fleet. capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2012 primarily related to machinery and equipment, expansion and replacement of existing cold drink equipment, our distribution fleet and it investments.
in 2015, we expect to incur annual capital expenditures, net of proceeds from disposals, in an amount approximately 3.00% of our net sales, which we expect to fund through cash provided by operating activities.
40
cash and cash equivalents as a result of the above items, cash and cash equivalents increased $84 million since december 31, 2013 to $237 million as of december 31, 2014 primarily driven by higher operating cash flows, lower capital expenditures and lower scheduled debt payments, partially offset by increased returns to our shareholders.
our cash balances are used to fund working capital requirements, scheduled debt and interest payments, income tax obligations, repurchases of our common stock, dividend payments and capital expenditures. cash generated by our foreign operations is generally repatriated to the u.s. annually except when required to fund working capital requirements in those jurisdictions. foreign cash balances were $51 million and $65 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we accrue tax costs for repatriation, as applicable, as cash is generated in those foreign jurisdictions.
acquisitions we have made acquisitions to strengthen our route to market in the u.s. and support efforts to build and enhance our leading brands. on october 31, 2014, we acquired certain assets of davis in exchange for $19 million in cash and a $2 million holdback liability to satisfy any working capital adjustments and applicable indemnification claims, pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement. on february 25, 2013, we acquired certain assets of dp/7up west in exchange for $23 million consisting of the issuance by us of 313,105 shares of common stock to dp/7up west and the assumption of certain liabilities of dp/7up west to consummate the transaction.
during the first quarter of 2013, we also reacquired the distribution rights for snapple and several other ncb brands in parts of asia-pacific from mondelēz.
we may continue to make future acquisitions, such as acquisitions of regional bottling companies, distributors and/or distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage. any acquisitions may require additional funding for future capital expenditures and possibly restructuring expenses.
dividends our board declared aggregate dividends aggregating of $1.64, $1.52 and $1.36 per share on outstanding common stock during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
our fourth quarter 2014 dividend was paid on january 7, 2015, to shareholders of record on december 15, 2014.
common stock repurchases as previously disclosed, our board has authorized us to purchase an aggregate amount of up to $3,000 million of our outstanding common stock. we repurchased and retired 6.8 million shares of common stock valued at approximately $400 million, 8.7 million shares of common stock valued at approximately $400 million and 9.5 million shares of common stock valued at approximately $400 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. refer to part ii, item 5 "market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding these repurchases.
41
contractual commitments and obligations we enter into various contractual obligations that impact, or could impact, our liquidity. based on our current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations. to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements, if necessary. refer to note 9 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the senior unsecured notes payments described in this table.
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and contingencies as of december 31, 2014 (in millions):

____________________________
(1)   amounts represent payment for the senior unsecured notes issued by us. please refer to note 9 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information.
(2)   amounts represent our contractual payment obligations for our lease arrangements classified as capital leases. these amounts exclude renewal options not yet executed but were included in the lease term to determine the capital lease obligation as the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that the renewal appeared reasonably assured at lease inception. additionally, we changed our leasing strategy during the year ended december 31, 2014. as a result of this change, the company converted a number of operating leases with a term less than twelve months into capital leases, which increased our contractual obligations.
(3)   amounts represent minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(4)   amounts represent payments under agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including capital obligations and long-term contractual obligations.
(5)   amounts represent our estimated interest payments based on specified interest rates for fixed rate debt and the impact of interest rate swaps which convert fixed interest rates to variable interest rates.
amounts excluded from our table as of december 31, 2014, we had $12 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, related interest and penalties classified as a long-term liability. the table above does not reflect any payments related to these amounts as it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or timing of the payment. refer to note 12 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements.
the total accrued benefit liability representing the underfunded position for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december 31, 2014 was approximately $44 million. this amount is impacted by, among other items, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan assumptions and the investment return on plan assets. we did not include estimated payments related to our total accrued benefit liability in the table above.
the pension protection act of 2006 was enacted in august 2006 and established, among other things, new standards for funding of u.s. defined benefit pension plans. we generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities. our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. we did not include our estimated contributions to our various single employer plans in the table above.
42
additionally, we recorded an estimated $57 million withdrawal liability during 2013 for certain multi-employer pension plans we have withdrawn from. as we can not estimate the timing or actual amount of payments until the plan formally assesses us with the withdrawal liability, those payments have been excluded from the table above.
refer to note 14 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our single employer and multi-employer plans discussed above.
we have a deferred compensation plan where the assets are maintained in a rabbi trust and the corresponding liability related to the plan is recorded in other non-current liabilities. we did not include estimated payments related to the deferred compensation liability as the timing and payment of these amounts are determined by the participants and outside our control. refer to note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements.
in general, we are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims. our insurance liability for our losses related to these programs are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history. as of december 31, 2014, our insurance liability totaled approximately $136 million. refer to notes 8 and 11 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements. we did not include estimated payments related to our insurance liability in the table above.
off-balance sheet arrangements we currently participate in three multi-employer pension plans. in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, the plan will ultimately assess us a withdrawal liability for exiting the plan, and u.s. gaap would require us to record the withdrawal charge as an expense in our consolidated statements of income and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets once the multi-employer pension withdrawal charge is probable and estimable. there are no other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources other than letters of credit outstanding.
refer to note 9 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding outstanding letters of credit.
other matters agreements with pepsico and coca-cola on february 26, 2010, we completed the licensing of certain brands to pepsico following pepsico's acquisitions of pepsi bottling group and pepsiamericas, inc. under the agreements, we received a one-time nonrefundable cash payment of $900 million. the agreements have an initial period of 20 years with automatic 20-year renewal periods, and require pepsico to meet certain performance conditions.
on october 4, 2010, we completed the licensing of certain brands to coca-cola following coca-cola's acquisition of coca-cola enterprises' north american bottling business and executed separate agreements pursuant to which coca-cola began offering dr pepper and diet dr pepper in local fountain accounts and its freestyle fountain program. under the agreements, we received a one-time nonrefundable cash payment of $715 million. the agreements have an initial period of 20 years with automatic 20-year renewal periods, and require coca-cola to meet certain performance conditions.
under a separate agreement, coca-cola has agreed to include dr pepper and diet dr pepper brands in its freestyle fountain program. the freestyle fountain program agreement has a period of 20 years.
these payments were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as net sales ratably over the estimated 25-year life of the customer relationships.
43
critical accounting estimates the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results and require difficult, subjective or complex estimates and assessments. these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary. we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess or measure our critical accounting estimates. we have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements. see note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies.

the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, impairment is recorded. the impairment tests for goodwill include comparing a fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill and considering any indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges ("step 1"). if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, impairment is indicated and a second step ("step 2") analysis must be performed.                                                                                                                                                                                                critical assumptions include revenue growth and profit performance, as well as an appropriate discount rate. discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt, adjusted with various risk premiums. for 2014, such discount rates ranged from 5.10% to 11.85%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               we have not identified any impairments in goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets during the past three years. the effect of a 1% increase or decrease in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit or the indefinite lived intangible asset does not change our conclusion regarding the identification of any impairments in goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue, net of the costs of our customer incentives, at the time risk of loss has been transferred to our customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      our customer incentives and marketing accrual methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate our customer participation and volume performance levels which impact the expense recognition. our estimate of the amount and timing of customer participation and volume performance levels is based primarily on a combination of known or historical transaction experience and forecasted volumes. differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized to earnings in the period differences are determined.   a 10% change in the accrual for our customer incentives and marketing programs as of december 31, 2014, would have affected our net sales and sg&amp;a expenses by $23 million and $2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
accruals for customer incentives and marketing programs are established for the expected payout based on contractual terms, volume-based metrics and/or historical trends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             further judgment is required to ensure the classification of the spend is correctly recorded as either a reduction from gross sales or advertising and marketing expense.

our largest u.s. defined benefit pension plan, which is a cash balance plan, was suspended and the accrued benefit was frozen effective december 31, 2008. participants in this plan no longer earn additional benefits for future services or salary increases.                                                                                                                                                                 the key assumptions we use in the actuarial methods to determine the plan obligations and related expenses include: (1) the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the plan liabilities; (2) retirement age and mortality; and (3) the expected return on plan assets. our assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best judgment regarding future performance.
employee benefit plan obligations and expenses included in our consolidated financial statements are determined from actuarial analyses based on plan assumptions, employee demographic data, years of service, compensation, benefits and claims paid and employer contributions.                                                                                                                                               refer to note 14 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information about the key assumptions.
multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liability we contribute to a number of multi-employer defined benefit plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover its union-represented employees. we record liabilities to exit a participating plan when an exit becomes both probable and estimable. the estimated withdrawal liability is determined from actuarial analyses based on historical and anticipated employer contributions.                      the calculation of the multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liability and related expense is dependent on several assumptions used to estimate the present value of the estimated withdrawal liability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           the effect of a 10% increase or decrease in the anticipated contributions used by the trustee to assess the withdrawal liability would change the withdrawal liability as of december 31, 2014 by approximately $6 million.
the key assumptions we use in the actuarial methods to determine the estimated withdrawal liability and related expenses include: (1) the amount of the anticipated contributions, which is based upon the timing of the withdrawal liability assessment provided by the trustee; (2) the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the estimated withdrawal liability; and (3) the expected return on plan assets. our assumptions reflect our best judgment regarding the outcome of the assessment.
risk management programs we retain selected levels of property, casualty, workers' compensation, health and other business risks. many of these risks are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or self-insured retentions.                                                                                                                                                                                                 we believe the use of actuarial methods to estimate our future losses provides a consistent and effective way to measure our self-insured liabilities. however, the estimation of our liability is judgmental and uncertain given the nature of claims involved and length of time until their ultimate cost is known.                                                                                                                                                                                              we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self-insured liabilities. the final settlement amount of claims can differ materially from our estimate as a result of changes in factors such as the frequency and severity of accidents, medical cost inflation, legislative actions, uncertainty around jury verdicts and awards and other factors outside of our control.
accrued liabilities related to the retained casualty and health risks are calculated based on loss experience and development factors, which contemplate a number of variables including claim history and expected trends. these loss development factors are established in consultation with actuaries.                                                                                                                                                                                                          a 10% change in our accrued liabilities related to the retained risks as of december 31, 2014 would have affected income from operations by approximately $14 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.

we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets. valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset primarily on historical earnings, our estimate of current and expected future earnings and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.    to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for uncertain tax positions has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.
if results differ from our assumptions, a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may be increased or decreased which would impact our effective tax rate.

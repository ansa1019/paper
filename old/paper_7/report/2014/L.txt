overview we are a holding company. our subsidiaries are engaged in the following lines of business:
   commercial property and casualty insurance (cna financial corporation (cna), a 90% owned subsidiary);

   operation of offshore oil and gas drilling rigs (diamond offshore drilling, inc. (diamond offshore), a 52.5% owned subsidiary);

   transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids and gathering and processing of natural gas (boardwalk pipeline partners, lp
(boardwalk pipeline), a 53% owned subsidiary); and

   operation of a chain of hotels (loews hotels holding corporation (loews hotels), a wholly owned subsidiary).

see below for a discussion of discontinued operations.
unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to loews corporation, the company, parent company, we, our, us or like terms refer to the business of loews corporation excluding its subsidiaries.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item 1a, risk factors, and item 8, financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k.
consolidated financial results income from continuing operations for 2014 was $962 million, or $2.52 per share, compared to $1.1 billion, or $2.95 per share, in 2013. consolidated net income for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $591 million, or $1.55 per share, compared to $595 million, or $1.53 per share, in 2013. net income includes discontinued operations reflecting the sale of highmount exploration & production, llc (highmount) and cnas annuity and pension deposit business.
income from continuing operations decreased primarily due to lower earnings at cna, diamond offshore and boardwalk pipeline.
cnas earnings declined due to lower net investment income as a result of reduced limited partnership income and lower favorable net prior year development as well as a $31 million loss (after tax and noncontrolling interests) on a coinsurance transaction related to the august 1, 2014 sale of cnas annuity and pension deposit business. these decreases were partially offset by improved current accident year underwriting results, lower catastrophe losses and the prior year impact of a $111 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance accounting related to the loss portfolio transfer (lpt). see the results of operations by business segment  cna financial  property and casualty claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for further information on the lpt transaction.
diamond offshores earnings decreased primarily due to lower utilization, an impairment loss of $55 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the carrying value of six semisubmersible rigs, and higher depreciation and interest expense. these decreases were partially offset by the absence of a prior year tax provision of $27 million (after noncontrolling interests) for an uncertain tax position related to its egyptian operations.
boardwalk pipelines earnings decreased primarily due to a $55 million charge (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the write-off of all previously capitalized costs incurred by the company and boardwalk pipeline for the proposed bluegrass project as well as higher operations, maintenance and depreciation expense in 2014. the prior year included a goodwill impairment charge of $16 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) partially offset by a gain on the sale of storage gas of $13 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests).
46
discontinued operations in 2014 include impairment charges related to the sale of highmount and cnas annuity and pension deposit business as well as the operations of those businesses. additionally, discontinued operations in 2013 included a goodwill impairment charge of $382 million (after tax), a ceiling test impairment charge of $186 million (after tax) and an impairment charge of $22 million (after tax) related to gathering pipelines at highmount.
book value per share increased to $51.70 at december 31, 2014 from $50.25 at december 31, 2013. book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) increased to $50.95 at december 31, 2014 from $49.38 at december 31, 2013.
discontinued operations on august 1, 2014, cna completed the sale of continental assurance company (cac), its life insurance subsidiary. in connection with the sale, we recorded a loss of $189 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests), which is reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income.
in may of 2014, the company announced that highmount, its natural gas and oil exploration and production subsidiary, was pursuing strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the business. on august 7, 2014, the company entered into an agreement to sell highmount to privately held affiliates of enervest, ltd. and on september 30, 2014, highmount was sold for net proceeds of $787 million. highmounts bank debt of $480 million was repaid from proceeds of the sale. we recorded a loss of $138 million (after tax) in connection with the sale which is reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income.
parent company structure we are a holding company and derive substantially all of our cash flow from our subsidiaries. we rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to our shareholders. the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of cna, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies (see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8) and compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements. claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and those of our creditors and shareholders.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. actual results could differ from those estimates.
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap, applied on a consistent basis. we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. in general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the known facts and circumstances.
we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of judgments, actual results could differ significantly from estimates, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or equity.
47
insurance reserves insurance reserves are established for both short and long-duration insurance contracts. short-duration contracts are primarily related to property and casualty insurance policies where the reserving process is based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss, including amounts for known and unknown claims. long-duration contracts are primarily related to long term care and are estimated using actuarial estimates about morbidity and persistency as well as assumptions about expected investment returns and future rate increases. the reserve for unearned premiums on property and casualty contracts represents the portion of premiums written related to the unexpired terms of coverage. the reserving process is discussed in further detail in the reserves  estimates and uncertainties section below.
reinsurance and other receivables an exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of ceded property and casualty and life reinsurance to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities cna has ceded under reinsurance agreements. an allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, cnas past experience and current economic conditions. further information on cnas reinsurance receivables is included in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
additionally, an exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of amounts due from customers on other receivables. an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due currently or in the future, managements experience and current economic conditions.
if actual experience differs from the estimates made by management in determining the allowances for doubtful accounts on reinsurance and other receivables, net receivables as reflected on our consolidated balance sheets may not be collected. therefore, our results of operations and/or equity could be materially adversely affected.
valuation of investments and impairment of securities we classify fixed maturity securities and equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading which are both carried at fair value. fair value represents the price that would be received in a sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date, the determination of which requires us to make a significant number of assumptions and judgments. securities with the greatest level of subjectivity around valuation are those that rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value and that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. these unobservable inputs are based on assumptions consistent with what we believe other market participants would use to price such securities. further information on fair value measurements is included in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
cnas investment portfolio is subject to market declines below amortized cost that may be other-than-temporary and therefore result in the recognition of impairment losses in earnings. factors considered in the determination of whether or not a decline is other-than-temporary include a current intention or need to sell the security or an indication that a credit loss exists. significant judgment exists regarding the evaluation of the financial condition and expected near-term and long term prospects of the issuer, the relevant industry conditions and trends, and whether cna expects to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. cna has an impairment committee which reviews the investment portfolio on at least a quarterly basis, with ongoing analysis as new information becomes available. further information on cnas process for evaluating impairments is included in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
long term care policies future policy benefit reserves for cnas long term care policies are based on certain assumptions including morbidity, persistency, discount rates and future rate increases. the adequacy of the reserves is contingent on actual experience related to these key assumptions, which were generally established at time of issue. if actual experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring cna to add to reserves.
48
a prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in cnas reserving discount rate assumption could result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting cnas obligations under long term care policies, which may also require an increase to cnas reserves. in addition, cna may not receive regulatory approval for the rate increases it requests.
these changes to cnas reserves could materially adversely impact our results of operations and equity. the reserving process is discussed in further detail in the reserves  estimates and uncertainties section below.
pension and postretirement benefit obligations we make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations under our benefit plans. the assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. these assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors such as inflation, interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies. changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.
in determining the discount rate assumption, we utilized current market information and liability information, including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations. in particular, the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities. the yield curve was applied to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans. the yield curves and indices evaluated in the selection of the discount rate are comprised of high quality corporate bonds that are rated aa by an accepted rating agency.
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we considered the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio.
further information on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations is in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
impairment of long-lived assets the company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. the company uses a probability-weighted cash flow analysis to test property and equipment for impairment based on relevant market data. if an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the fair value of the asset. managements cash flow assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from the reported amounts.
goodwill goodwill is required to be evaluated on an annual basis and whenever, in managements judgment, there is a significant change in circumstances that would be considered a triggering event. management must apply judgment in assessing qualitatively whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. factors such as a reporting units planned future operating results, long term growth outlook and industry and market conditions are considered. judgment is also applied in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units assets and liabilities for purposes of performing quantitative goodwill impairment tests. management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples.
49
income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities. any resulting future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes may not be realized. the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations. in addition, the ability to record deferred tax assets in the future could be limited resulting in a higher effective tax rate in that future period.
the company has not established deferred tax liabilities for certain of its foreign earnings as it intends to indefinitely reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities. however, if these earnings become subject to u.s. federal tax, any required provision could have a material impact on our financial results.
results of operations by business segment unless the context otherwise requires, references to net operating income (loss), net realized investment results and net income (loss) reflect amounts attributable to loews corporation shareholders.
cna financial reserves  estimates and uncertainties the level of reserves cna maintains represents its best estimate, as of a particular point in time, of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on cnas assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time. reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates that cna derives, generally utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, both internal and external, many of which are highly uncertain. as noted below, cna reviews its reserves for each segment of its business periodically and any such review could result in the need to increase reserves in amounts which could be material and could adversely affect its results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings. further information on reserves is provided in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
property and casualty claim and claim adjustment expense reserves cna maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for claims that have been reported but not yet settled (case reserves) and claims that have been incurred but not reported (ibnr). claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are reflected as liabilities and are included on the consolidated balance sheets under the heading insurance reserves. adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. the carried case and ibnr reserves as of each balance sheet date are provided in the discussion that follows and in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
cna is subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change. these issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on cnas business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include:
                      uncertainty in future medical costs in workers compensation. in particular, medical cost inflation could be greater than expected due to new treatments, drugs and devices; increased health care utilization; and/or the future costs of health care facilities. in addition, the relationship between workers compensation and

50
government and private health care providers could change, potentially shifting costs to workers compensation;

   increased uncertainty related to medical professional liability, medical products liability and workers compensation coverages resulting from the patient protection and affordable care act;

   significant class action litigation; and

   mass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to benzene, lead, noise induced hearing loss, injuries from various medical products including pharmaceuticals and various other chemical and radiation exposure claims.

the impact of these and other unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage issues is difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect the adequacy of cnas claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and could lead to future reserve additions.
cnas property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also have actual and potential exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (a&ep) claims. cnas experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating to a&ep claims and the related claim adjustment expenses are subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment reserves for a&ep. as a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported a&ep claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.
to mitigate the risks posed by cnas exposure to a&ep claims and claim adjustment expenses, as further discussed in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8, on august 31, 2010, cna completed a transaction with national indemnity company (nico), under which substantially all of cnas legacy a&ep liabilities were ceded to nico effective january 1, 2010 (loss portfolio transfer or lpt).
the loss portfolio transfer is a retroactive reinsurance contract. during the fourth quarter of 2013 the cumulative amounts ceded under the loss portfolio transfer exceeded the consideration paid, resulting in a $189 million deferred retroactive reinsurance gain. this deferred benefit will be recognized in earnings in future periods in proportion to actual recoveries under the loss portfolio transfer. over the life of the contract, there is no economic impact as long as any additional losses are within the limit under the contract. the fourth quarter of 2014 a&ep reserve review was not completed. additional information and analysis on inuring third party reinsurance recoveries are needed to finalize the review. cna expects to complete the review in the first half of 2015.
establishing property & casualty reserve estimates in developing claim and claim adjustment expense (loss or losses) reserve estimates, cnas actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses that are staggered throughout the year. the data is organized at a product level. a product can be a line of business covering a subset of insureds such as commercial automobile liability for small or middle market customers, it can encompass several lines of business provided to a specific set of customers such as dentists, or it can be a particular type of claim such as construction defect. every product is reviewed at least once during the year. the analyses generally review losses gross of ceded reinsurance and apply the ceded reinsurance terms to the gross estimates to establish estimates net of reinsurance. in addition to the detailed analyses, cna reviews actual loss emergence for all products each quarter.
the detailed analyses use a variety of generally accepted actuarial methods and techniques to produce a number of estimates of ultimate loss. cnas actuaries determine a point estimate of ultimate loss by reviewing the various estimates and assigning weight to each estimate given the characteristics of the product being reviewed. the reserve estimate is the difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the losses paid to date. the difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the case incurred loss (paid loss plus case reserve) is ibnr. ibnr calculated as such includes a provision for development on known cases (supplemental development) as well as a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported (pure ibnr).
51
most of cnas business can be characterized as long-tail. for long-tail business, it will generally be several years between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled. cnas long-tail exposures include commercial automobile liability, workers compensation, general liability, medical professional liability, other professional liability and management liability coverages, assumed reinsurance run-off and products liability. short-tail exposures include property, commercial automobile physical damage, marine, surety and warranty. specialty, commercial and international contain both long-tail and short-tail exposures. other contains long-tail exposures.
various methods are used to project ultimate loss for both long-tail and short-tail exposures including, but not limited to, the following:
   paid development;

   incurred development;

   loss ratio;

   bornhuetter-ferguson using paid loss;

   bornhuetter-ferguson using incurred loss;

   frequency times severity; and

   stochastic modeling.

the paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident or policy years with further expected changes in paid loss. selection of the paid loss pattern may require consideration of several factors including the impact of inflation on claims costs, the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes, the impact of large claim payments and other factors. claim cost inflation itself may require evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate, changes in any of these factors can impact the results. since the method does not rely on case reserves, it is not directly influenced by changes in the adequacy of case reserves.
for many products, paid loss data for recent periods may be too immature or erratic for accurate predictions. this situation often exists for long-tail exposures. in addition, changes in the factors described above may result in inconsistent payment patterns. finally, estimating the paid loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available in the data analyzed often involves considerable uncertainty for long-tail products such as workers compensation.
the incurred development method is similar to the paid development method, but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses. since the method uses more data (case reserves in addition to paid losses) than the paid development method, the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid patterns. however, selection of the incurred loss pattern typically requires analysis of all of the same factors described above. in addition, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place, and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available.
the loss ratio method multiplies earned premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident or policy year. this method may be useful for immature accident or policy periods or if loss development patterns are inconsistent, losses emerge very slowly, or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses. the selection of the expected loss ratio typically requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident or policy years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends, frequency trends, rate changes, underwriting changes and other applicable factors.
52
the bornhuetter-ferguson method using paid loss is a combination of the paid development method and the loss ratio method. this method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the approach used to estimate the expected loss ratio for the loss ratio method and typically requires analysis of the same factors described above. this method assumes that future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level. the percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid. the use of the pattern from the paid development method typically requires consideration of the same factors listed in the description of the paid development method. the estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year. for long-tail lines, this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation.
the bornhuetter-ferguson method using incurred loss is similar to the bornhuetter-ferguson method using paid loss except that it uses case incurred losses. the use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns. however, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving have taken place, and the method typically requires analysis of the same factors that need to be reviewed for the loss ratio and incurred development methods.
the frequency times severity method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for each accident or policy year to produce ultimate loss estimates. since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate loss, this method can provide more reliable results for products where loss development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on exclusively. in addition, this method can more directly account for changes in coverage that impact the number and size of claims. however, this method can be difficult to apply to situations where very large claims or a substantial number of unusual claims result in volatile average claim sizes. projecting the ultimate number of claims may require analysis of several factors including the rate at which policyholders report claims to cna, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes and other factors. estimating the ultimate average loss may require analysis of the impact of large losses and claim cost trends based on changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors.
stochastic modeling produces a range of possible outcomes based on varying assumptions related to the particular product being modeled. for some products, cna uses models which rely on historical development patterns at an aggregate level, while other products are modeled using individual claim variability assumptions supplied by the claims department. in either case, multiple simulations are run and the results are analyzed to produce a range of potential outcomes. the results will typically include a mean and percentiles of the possible reserve distribution which aid in the selection of a point estimate.
for many exposures, especially those that can be considered long-tail, a particular accident or policy year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses. in such a case, cnas actuaries typically assign more weight to the incurred development method than to the paid development method. as claims continue to settle and the volume of paid loss increases, the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method. for most of cnas products, even the incurred losses for accident or policy years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses. in these cases, cna will not assign any weight to the paid and incurred development methods. cna will use the loss ratio, bornhuetter-ferguson and frequency times severity methods. for short-tail exposures, the paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner primarily because cnas history includes a sufficient number of years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change. however, cna may also use the loss ratio, bornhuetter-ferguson and frequency times severity methods for short-tail exposures.
for other more complex products where the above methods may not produce reliable indications, cna uses additional methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation.
53
periodic reserve reviews the reserve analyses performed by cnas actuaries result in point estimates. each quarter, the results of the detailed reserve reviews are summarized and discussed with cnas senior management to determine the best estimate of reserves. cnas senior management considers many factors in making this decision. the factors include, but are not limited to, the historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial indications, the sensitivity of the actuarial indications to changes in paid and incurred loss patterns, the consistency of claims handling processes, the consistency of case reserving practices, changes in cnas pricing and underwriting, pricing and underwriting trends in the insurance market and legal, judicial, social and economic trends.
cnas recorded reserves reflect its best estimate as of a particular point in time based upon known facts, consideration of the factors cited above and its judgment. the carried reserve may differ from the actuarial point estimate as the result of cnas consideration of the factors noted above as well as the potential volatility of the projections associated with the specific product being analyzed and other factors affecting claims costs that may not be quantifiable through traditional actuarial analysis. this process results in managements best estimate which is then recorded as the loss reserve.
currently, cnas recorded reserves are modestly higher than the actuarial point estimate. for commercial, specialty and international, the difference between cnas reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by uncertainty with respect to immature accident years, claim cost inflation, changes in claims handling, changes to the tort environment which may adversely impact claim costs and the effects from the economy. for cnas legacy a&ep liabilities, the difference between cnas reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by the potential tail volatility of run-off exposures.
the key assumptions fundamental to the reserving process are often different for various products and accident or policy years. some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a particular method, but most of the assumptions are implicit and cannot be precisely quantified. an example of an explicit assumption is the pattern employed in the paid development method. however, the assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions such as the impact of inflation on medical costs and the rate at which claim professionals close claims. as a result, the effect on reserve estimates of a particular change in assumptions typically cannot be specifically quantified, and changes in these assumptions cannot be tracked over time.
cnas recorded reserves are managements best estimate. in order to provide an indication of the variability associated with cnas net reserves, the following discussion provides a sensitivity analysis that shows the approximate estimated impact of variations in significant factors affecting cnas reserve estimates for particular types of business. these significant factors are the ones that cna believes could most likely materially affect the reserves. this discussion covers the major types of business for which cna believes a material deviation to its reserves is reasonably possible. there can be no assurance that actual experience will be consistent with the current assumptions or with the variation indicated by the discussion. in addition, there can be no assurance that other factors and assumptions will not have a material impact on cnas reserves.
cna believes a material deviation to its net reserves is reasonably possible for professional liability and management liability products and surety products. this includes professional liability coverages provided to various professional firms, including architects, real estate agents, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law firms and other professional firms. this also includes d&o, employment practices, fiduciary, fidelity and surety coverages, as well as insurance products serving the health care delivery system. the most significant factor affecting reserve estimates for these products is claim severity. claim severity is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, legal fees, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. underwriting and claim handling decisions such as the classes of business written and individual claim settlement decisions can also impact claim severity. if the estimated claim severity increases by 9%, cna estimates that the net reserves would increase by approximately $500 million. if the estimated claim severity decreases by 3%, cna estimates that net reserves would decrease by approximately $150 million. cnas net reserves for these products were approximately $5.4 billion at december 31, 2014.

the two types of business for which cna believes a significant deviation to its net reserves is reasonably possible are workers compensation and general liability.
for workers compensation, since many years will pass from the time the business is written until all claim payments have been made, claim cost inflation on claim payments is the most significant factor affecting workers compensation reserve estimates. workers compensation claim cost inflation is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, expected claimant lifetimes, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. if estimated workers compensation claim cost inflation increases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, cna estimates that its net reserves would increase by approximately $400 million. if estimated workers compensation claim cost inflation decreases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, cna estimates that its net reserves would decrease by approximately $400 million. net reserves for workers compensation were approximately $4.5 billion at december 31, 2014.
for general liability, the most significant factor affecting reserve estimates is claim severity. claim severity is driven by changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislation and other factors. if the estimated claim severity for general liability increases by 6%, cna estimates that its net reserves would increase by approximately $200 million. if the estimated claim severity for general liability decreases by 3%, cna estimates that its net reserves would decrease by approximately $100 million. net reserves for general liability were approximately $3.7 billion at december 31, 2014.
given the factors described above, it is not possible to quantify precisely the ultimate exposure represented by claims and related litigation. as a result, cna regularly reviews the adequacy of its reserves and reassesses its reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled and additional information becomes available in subsequent periods.
in light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, cna reviews its reserve estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. these reviews have resulted in cnas identification of information and trends that have caused cna to change its reserves in prior periods and could lead to the identification of a need for additional material increases or decreases in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, which could materially affect our results of operations and equity and cnas business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings positively or negatively. see the ratings section of this md&a for further information regarding cnas financial strength and corporate debt ratings.

life & group non-core policyholder reserves cna calculates and maintains reserves for policyholder benefits for life & group non-core, which primarily includes long term care, based on actuarial assumptions. the determination of these reserves is fundamental to its financial results and requires management to make assumptions about expected investment and policyholder experience over the life of the contract. since many of these contracts may be in force for several decades, these assumptions are subject to significant estimation risk.
the actuarial assumptions represent managements best estimates at the date the contract was issued plus a margin for adverse deviation. actuarial assumptions include estimates of morbidity, persistency, discount rates and expenses over the life of the contracts. under gaap, these assumptions are locked in throughout the life of the contract unless a premium deficiency develops. the impact of differences between the actuarial assumptions and actual experience is reflected in results of operations each period.
long term care policies provide benefits for nursing home, assisted living and home health care subject to various daily and lifetime caps. policyholders must continue to make periodic premium payments to keep the policy in force. generally cna has the ability to increase policy premiums, subject to state regulatory approval.
cnas long term care reserves consist of an active life reserve, a liability for due and unpaid claims, claims in the course of settlement and incurred but not reported claims. the active life reserve represents the present value of expected future benefit payments and expenses less expected future premium.
the actuarial assumptions that management believes are subject to the most variability are discount rate, morbidity and persistency. persistency can be affected by policy lapses and death. discount rate is influenced by the investment yield on assets supporting long term care reserves which is subject to interest rate and market volatility. there is limited historical company and industry data available to cna for long term care morbidity and mortality, as only a small portion of the policies written to date are in claims paying status. as a result of this variability, cnas long term care reserves may be subject to material increases if actual experience develops adversely to its expectations.
annually, management assesses the adequacy of its gaap reserves by product group by performing a gross premium valuation (gpv) to determine if there is a premium deficiency. under the gpv, management estimates required reserves using best estimate assumptions, including anticipated future rate increases, as of the date of the assessment without provisions for adverse deviation. the gpv reserves are then compared to the recorded reserves. if the gpv reserves are greater than the existing net gaap reserves (i.e. reserves net of any deferred acquisition costs asset), the existing net gaap reserves are unlocked and are increased to the greater amount. any such increase would be reflected in cnas results of operations in the period in which the need for such adjustment is determined, and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and equity and cnas business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.

the level of margin in cnas long term care reserves at december 31, 2014 was approximately $100 million, a decrease of approximately $250 million from the prior year end. a summary of the changes in the margin is presented in the table below:
(in millions)
long term care active life reserve margin december 31, 2013 margin                               $350
investment assumptions:

updated investment strategy/assumptions                 325
operating assumptions:

december 31, 2014 margin                               $100
the decrease in the margin from the updated investment rate and spread assumptions reflects the impact of the decline in interest rates in 2014 and the expectation of a lower interest rate environment on the current year gpv. this margin reduction was somewhat offset by actual investment yields achieved during the year and planned changes in cnas investment strategy.
the decline in the margin related to liability assumptions was driven by morbidity. this was more than offset by an increase in planned rate increase actions.
the table below summarizes the estimated pretax impact on cnas results of operations from various hypothetical revisions to its assumptions. cna has assumed that revisions to such assumptions would occur in each policy type, age and duration within each policy group and would occur absent any changes, mitigating or otherwise, in the other assumptions. although such hypothetical revisions are not currently required or anticipated, cna believes they could occur based on past variances in experience and its expectations of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur.
any required increase in the net gaap reserves resulting from the hypothetical revisions in the table below would first reduce the margin in cnas carried reserves before it would affect results of operations. the estimated impacts to results of operations in the table below are after consideration of the existing margin.

2014 compared with 2013
income from continuing operations decreased $27 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 due to lower net investment income of $215 million, primarily driven by reduced limited partnership results, lower favorable net prior year development and a $31 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) loss on the coinsurance transaction related to the sale of cnas annuity and pension deposit business. these decreases were partially offset by an increase of $38 million ($22 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) in investment gains, improved current accident year underwriting results and the prior year impact of a $111 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance accounting related to the loss portfolio transfer. see the investments section of this md&a for further discussion of net realized investment results and net investment income. further information on net prior year development for 2014 and 2013 is included in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
2013 compared with 2012
income from continuing operations increased $295 million in 2013 as compared with 2012. net investment income increased $172 million, primarily driven by a significant increase in limited partnership results. this increase was partially offset by a decrease of $35 million ($20 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) in investment gains. see the investments section of this md&a for further discussion of net realized investment results and net investment income. insurance premiums increased $390 million, including an increase of $241 million related to hardy, which was acquired in july of 2012. insurance claims and policyholders benefits increased $77 million, primarily due to the impact of the $111 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance accounting related to the loss portfolio transfer and lower aggregate favorable net prior year development, partially offset by lower catastrophe impacts. further information on net prior year development for 2013 and 2012 is included in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.

as a result of realigned management responsibilities at cna, we revised the cna related segments in the fourth quarter of 2014 to specialty, commercial, international and other non-core. results of cna europe and canada that were previously included in the specialty and commercial segments and results of hardy that were previously included in the other non-core segment are now included in the international segment. prior period segment disclosures have been conformed to the current year presentation.
cna property and casualty insurance operations cnas property and casualty insurance operations consist of professional, financial, specialty property and casualty products and services and commercial insurance and risk management products.
in evaluating the results of the property and casualty businesses, cna utilizes the loss ratio, the expense ratio, the dividend ratio and the combined ratio. these ratios are calculated using gaap financial results. the loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. the expense ratio is the percentage of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. the dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholders dividends incurred to net earned premiums. the combined ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend ratios.
the following table summarizes the results of cnas property and casualty operations for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

2014 compared with 2013
net written premiums decreased $263 million in 2014 as compared with 2013. the decrease in net written premiums was primarily driven by a lower level of new business, reflecting competitive market conditions in commercial and specialty, underwriting actions taken in certain business classes in commercial and a 2013 commutation by hardy, partially offset by continued rate increases in commercial. net earned premiums decreased $58 million in 2014 as compared with 2013, consistent with decreases in net written premiums.
specialtys average rate increased 3% in 2014 as compared with an increase of 6% in 2013, for the policies that renewed in each period. retention of 86% and 85% was achieved in each period. commercials average rate increased 5% in 2014 as compared with an increase of 9% in 2013, for the policies that renewed in each period. retention of 74% was achieved in each period. internationals average rate decreased 1% in 2014 as compared with an increase of 1% in 2013, for the policies that renewed in each period. retention of 74% and 79% was achieved in each period.
net operating income decreased $157 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to lower net investment income, less favorable net prior year development and a legal settlement benefit of $28 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2013 for commercial, partially offset by improved current accident year underwriting results in specialty and commercial. catastrophe losses were $92 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2014 as compared to $100 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2013.
favorable net prior year development decreased by $105 million, from $155 million in 2013 to $50 million in 2014. further information on net prior year development is included in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
specialtys combined ratio increased 0.5 points in 2014 as compared with 2013. the loss ratio increased 0.3 points due to less favorable net prior year development, partially offset by improvement in the current accident year loss ratio.
commercials combined ratio and loss ratio in 2014 were largely consistent with 2013. the expense ratio improved 0.3 points in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to the favorable impact of recoveries on insurance receivables written off in prior years.
internationals combined ratio improved 0.7 points in 2014 as compared with 2013. the loss ratio increased 0.1 points, due to the higher current accident year loss ratio, substantially offset by the impact of commutations. the expense ratio improved 0.8 points in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to decreased acquisition expenses.

2013 compared with 2012
net written premiums increased $385 million in 2013 as compared with 2012, including an increase of $279 million in international related to hardy. excluding hardy, the increase in net written premiums was primarily driven by increased rate, partially offset by underwriting actions taken in certain business classes in commercial. net earned premiums increased $391 million in 2013 as compared with 2012, including $241 million in international related to hardy. excluding hardy, the increase in net earned premiums was consistent with increases in net written premiums.
specialtys average rate increased 6% in 2013 as compared with an increase of 5% in 2012, for the policies that renewed in each period. retention of 85% and 86% was achieved in each period. commercials average rate increased 9% in 2013 as compared with an increase of 7% in 2012, for the policies that renewed in each period. retention of 74% and 77% was achieved in each period. internationals average rate increased 1% in 2013 as compared with an increase of 2% in 2012 for the policies that renewed in each period. retention of 79% and 80% was achieved in each period.
net operating income increased $383 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to improved underwriting results, higher net investment income and a legal settlement benefit of $28 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2013 for commercial. these favorable impacts were partially offset by unfavorable net prior year development in 2013 for commercial. catastrophe losses were $100 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2013 as compared to $243 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2012.
the combined ratio improved 7.1 points in 2013 as compared to 2012. the loss ratio improved 6.2 points in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to an improved current accident year non-catastrophe loss ratio and decreased catastrophe losses in commercial and international. the expense ratio improved by 0.9 points, primarily due to the impact of lower underwriting expenses and a higher net earned premium base in specialty and decreased expenses including favorable changes in estimates of insurance assessment liabilities in commercial, partially offset by increased expenses in international.
favorable net prior year development decreased by $84 million, from $239 million in 2012 to $155 million in 2013. further information on net prior year development is included in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.

2014 compared with 2013
results from continuing operations increased $107 million in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily driven by the prior year impact of a $111 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance accounting related to the loss portfolio transfer, as further discussed in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8. results in 2014 included a $50 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) benefit related to a postretirement plan curtailment, substantially offset by a $49 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) lump sum pension plan settlement, as further discussed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
results in cnas long term care and life settlement business improved in 2014, but that improvement was substantially offset by the $31 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) loss on the coinsurance transaction related to the sale of cnas annuity and pension deposit business and results for cnas remaining structured settlements. the improved results in long term care were driven by higher net investment income attributable to a higher invested asset base and portfolio allocation of tax-exempt bonds, rate increase actions and the slightly more favorable net morbidity and persistency.
2013 compared with 2012
results from continuing operations decreased $76 million in 2013 as compared with 2012, primarily driven by the impact of the deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance accounting related to the loss portfolio transfer, as discussed above, partially offset by higher net investment income.
cnas long term care business was positively impacted in 2013 by the effect of rate increase actions and long term care claim reserve strengthening in 2012, partially offset by unfavorable morbidity.

diamond offshore diamond offshores pretax income is primarily a function of contract drilling revenue earned less contract drilling expenses incurred or recognized. the two most significant variables affecting diamond offshores revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates, each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace. these factors are not within diamond offshores control and are difficult to predict. revenue from dayrate drilling contracts are generally recognized as services are performed, consequently, when a rig is idle, no dayrate is earned and revenue will decrease as a result. revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, rig mobilizations, required surveys and shipyard projects. in connection with certain drilling contracts, diamond offshore may receive fees for the mobilization of equipment. in addition, some of diamond offshores drilling contracts require downtime before the start of the contract to prepare the rig to meet customer requirements for which it may or may not be compensated.
diamond offshores pretax income is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses. operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates, and short term reductions in utilization do not necessarily result in lower operating expenses. for instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or warm stacked state with a full crew. in addition, when a rig is idle, diamond offshore is responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract. however, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, diamond offshore may reduce the size of a rigs crew and take steps to cold stack the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on pretax income.
operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of diamond offshores drilling equipment. the principal components of diamond offshores operating costs are, among other things, direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and helicopter rentals and insurance. labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most significant components of diamond offshores operating expenses. in general, labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels, rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which diamond offshores rigs operate. in addition, the costs associated with training new and seasoned employees can be significant. costs to repair and maintain equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling rig is performing, as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which diamond offshores rigs are working.
pretax income is negatively impacted when diamond offshore performs certain regulatory inspections, which it refers to as a 5-year survey, or special survey, that are due every five years for each of diamond offshores rigs. operating revenue decreases because these special surveys are generally performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard. operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs which are recognized as incurred. repair and maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. the number of rigs undergoing a 5-year survey will vary from year to year, as well as from quarter to quarter.
in addition, pretax income may also be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between 5-year surveys. intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a 5-year survey. although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the drilling rig, it normally does not require dry-docking or shipyard time, except for rigs, generally older than 15 years that are located in the united kingdom (u.k.) and norwegian sectors of the north sea.
during 2015, two of diamond offshores rigs will require 5-year surveys, which it expects to result in approximately 120 days of downtime in the aggregate. diamond offshore expects to spend an additional approximately 980 days for intermediate surveys, the mobilization of rigs, contract acceptance testing and extended maintenance projects, including days associated with mobilization and acceptance testing for the recently delivered ocean blackhornet and ocean blackrhino (approximately 195 days in the aggregate) and the ocean blacklion (approximately 240 days), which is under construction and expected to be delivered late in the first quarter of 2015. diamond offshore expects the ocean confidence to be unavailable through the first quarter of 2015 (approximately 90 days) as it completes its service-life-extension project. diamond offshore can provide no assurance as to the

exact timing and/or duration of downtime associated with regulatory inspections, planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects.
diamond offshore is self-insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the u.s. gulf of mexico (gom). if a named windstorm in the gom causes significant damage to diamond offshores rigs or equipment, it could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. under its insurance policy that expires on may 1, 2015, diamond offshore carries physical damage insurance for certain losses other than those caused by named windstorms in the gom for which its deductible for physical damage is $25 million per occurrence. diamond offshore does not typically retain loss-of-hire insurance policies to cover its rigs.
in addition, under its current insurance policy, diamond offshore carries marine liability insurance covering certain legal liabilities, including coverage for certain personal injury claims, and generally covering liabilities arising out of or relating to pollution and/or environmental risk. diamond offshore believes that the policy limit for its marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of its size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for diamond offshores business. diamond offshores deductibles for marine liability coverage, including for personal injury claims, are $25 million for the first occurrence and vary in amounts ranging between $5 million and, if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up to $100 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims that might arise during the policy year.
recent developments market fundamentals in the oil and gas industry continued to deteriorate in the fourth quarter of 2014 and into 2015. the dramatic decline in oil prices since the summer of 2014 has led many of diamond offshores customers or potential customers to announce significant cutbacks to their 2015 capital spending plans. these adverse market conditions have resulted in reduced demand for offshore drilling rigs by diamond offshores customers and an oversupply of rigs available for charter. based on these factors, industry analysts predict dayrates to decline further as competition to keep rigs active continues to intensify. as of february 9, 2015, eight of diamond offshores rigs were not subject to a drilling contract with a customer, including six rigs that have been cold stacked or are in the process of being cold stacked.
in declining markets, rig tenders by diamond offshores customers may be for shorter terms or on a well-to-well basis and increased competition for the tenders may drive down contract dayrates. it is also not unusual for adverse market conditions to result in the migration of some ultra-deepwater rigs to work in deepwater and, likewise, some deepwater rigs to compete against mid-water rigs, or even ultra-deepwater rigs to work in some mid-water markets. this has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on diamond offshores fleet, and particularly lower specification mid-water rigs, as indicated by the retirement of six of diamond offshores mid-water semisubmersible rigs during 2014, three of which have since been scrapped.
another characteristic of the depressed market conditions in the offshore drilling industry is that certain customers may attempt to renegotiate or terminate drilling contracts. some of diamond offshores drilling contracts, particularly contracts with national oil companies or government-controlled entities, permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods, sometimes resulting in no payment to diamond offshore or sometimes resulting in a contractually specified termination amount, which may not fully compensate diamond offshore for the loss of the contract. during depressed market conditions, certain customers may be more motivated to utilize such contract clauses to seek to renegotiate or terminate a drilling contract. in addition, in depressed conditions certain customers may be motivated to claim that diamond offshore has breached provisions of its drilling contracts in order to avoid their obligations to diamond offshore under circumstances where it believes it is in compliance with the contracts. the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could adversely affect diamond offshores business. when a customer terminates a contract prior to the contracts scheduled expiration, the contract backlog is adversely impacted.
on february 20, 2015, a representative of pemexexploración y producción, (pemex), verbally informed diamond offshore of pemexs intention to exercise its contractual right to terminate its drilling contracts on the ocean ambassador, the ocean nugget and the ocean summit, and to cancel its drilling contract on the ocean
65
lexington, which contract was scheduled to begin in september 2015. diamond offshore has not received written notice of termination or cancellation. diamond offshore is in discussions with pemex regarding the rigs.
in addition, petróleo brasileiro s.a., (petrobras), recently notified diamond offshore that it has a right to terminate the drilling contract on the ocean baroness and has verbally informed diamond offshore that it does not intend to continue to use the rig. diamond offshore is currently in discussions with petrobras regarding the rig.
the impact of the depressed market conditions in the offshore drilling industry has materially impacted diamond offshores results of operations and cash flows in 2014. diamond offshore currently expects that these adverse conditions will continue through 2015 and likely into 2016 or even longer. the continuation of these conditions could result in more of diamond offshores rigs being without contracts and/or cold stacked and could further materially and adversely affect its business. when diamond offshore cold stacks a rig, they evaluate the rig for impairment.
although these general market conditions impact all segments of the offshore drilling market, the following discussion addresses market conditions within segments of the floater market.
globally, the ultra-deepwater and deepwater floater markets continue to weaken. the continuing oversupply of rigs, combined with diminished demand, has resulted in further declines in dayrates and the stacking of rigs in all asset classes, and industry reports expect offshore drillers to continue to scrap older, lower specification rigs. during 2014, there were few bidding opportunities, and the outlook for 2015 is pessimistic. competition for a limited number of jobs has been intense, with numerous offshore drillers vying for the same opportunities, including some competitors bidding multiple rigs on the same bid, and operators attempting to sublet previously contracted rigs for which capital spending programs have been delayed and/or canceled.
the influx of newbuilds into the market, combined with established rigs that came off contract in 2014 or are expected to complete contracts during 2015 and 2016, is expected to contribute to the further weakening of the ultra-deepwater and deepwater floater markets. based on industry data, there are approximately 59 competitive, or non-owner-operated, newbuild floaters on order, and an estimated 29 additional rigs potentially to be built on behalf of petrobras, which is currently diamond offshores largest single customer based on annual consolidated revenues. based on industry reports, of the competitive rigs, 16 of the 31 newbuilds scheduled for delivery in 2015, as well as nine of the 14 newbuilds scheduled for delivery in 2016, are not yet contracted for future work.
conditions in the mid-water market have varied by region, but have generally been adversely impacted by lower demand, the waterfall effect of declining dayrates in the ultra-deepwater and deepwater markets, the challenges experienced by lower specification rigs in this segment as a result of growing regulatory demands and more complex customer specifications, and the intensified competition resulting from the migration of some deepwater and ultra-deepwater rigs to compete against mid-water rigs. as higher specification rigs take the place of lower specification rigs, some lower specification rigs are expected to be cold stacked or ultimately scrapped.
impact of changes in tax laws or their interpretation diamond offshore operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. as a result, it is subject to highly complex tax laws, treaties and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, which may change and are subject to interpretation. changes in laws, treaties and regulations and the interpretation of such laws, treaties and regulations may put diamond offshore at risk for future tax assessments and liabilities which could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows. further information is provided in notes 11 and 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
contract drilling backlog the following table reflects diamond offshores contract drilling backlog as of february 9, 2015, october 21, 2014 (the date reported in our quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 2014) and february 5, 2014 (the date reported in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2013). contract drilling backlog as presented below includes only firm commitments (typically represented by signed
66
contracts) and is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period and adding one-half of any potential rig performance bonuses. diamond offshores calculation also assumes full utilization of its drilling equipment for the contract period (excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days); however, the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors. utilization rates, which generally approach 92% - 98% during contracted periods, can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including, but not limited to, weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance. contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. no revenue is generally earned during periods of downtime for regulatory surveys. changes in diamond offshores contract drilling backlog between periods are generally a function of the performance of work on term contracts, as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts. in addition, under certain circumstances, diamond offshores customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate their contracts.

contract drilling revenue decreased $107 million in 2014 as compared with 2013. contract drilling revenue decreased primarily due to fewer overall revenue earning days, partially offset by higher average daily revenue primarily earned by ultra-deepwater floaters.
revenue generated by ultra-deepwater floaters increased $133 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 as a result of higher average daily revenue of $219 million, including the recognition of incremental mobilization and contract preparation fees of $51 million, partially offset by a decrease in utilization of $86 million. average daily revenue increased primarily due to several rigs operating under higher dayrates as compared to 2013. the reduction in revenue earning days is primarily due to incremental downtime for inspections and shipyard projects, including the ocean confidence life-extension project, downtime in between contracts and rig mobilizations, partially offset by a reduction in unscheduled downtime for repairs and incremental revenue earning days for the ocean blackhawk which was placed in service in 2014.
revenue generated by deepwater floaters decreased $123 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily due to lower utilization of $131 million, partially offset by higher average daily revenue of $8 million which reflected an increase in amortized mobilization and contract preparation revenue. the decrease in revenue earning days was the result of unplanned downtime associated with the warm stacking of rigs between contracts and incremental scheduled downtime for surveys and shipyard projects and rig mobilizations, partially offset by incremental revenue earning days for the ocean onyx which was placed into service during 2014.
revenue generated by mid-water floaters decreased $121 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily due to lower utilization of $62 million and lower average daily revenue of $59 million. the decrease in revenue earning days reflects the net impact of unplanned downtime associated with the cold stacking of rigs, unpaid equipment repairs and downtime between contracts, partially offset by a reduction in planned downtime for shipyard projects and regulatory inspections. the decrease in average daily revenue primarily reflects lower amortized mobilization and contract preparation revenue of $36 million and the ocean quest operating in vietnam at a lower dayrate in 2014 as compared with 2013, partially offset by higher dayrates earned by diamond offshores north sea rigs.
70
revenue generated by jack-up rigs increased $4 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily due to an increase in average daily revenue of $14 million as a result of higher dayrates earned by several jack-up rigs during 2014, partially offset by lower utilization of $9 million compared to the prior year period.
net income decreased $74 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily reflecting the decrease in revenue, the impact of a $109 million impairment loss ($55 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the carrying value of diamond offshores semisubmersible rigs, higher general and administrative expense and depreciation expense, as well as an increase in interest expense related to the $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in november of 2013. general and administrative costs for 2014 include higher employee compensation and termination benefits paid to certain current and former key executives. these increases were partially offset by a $9 million gain ($3 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) recognized on the sale of the previously held for sale jack-up rig ocean spartan in the second quarter of 2014. diamond offshore recognized a charge for an uncollectible receivable of $23 million ($9 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2013.
diamond offshores effective tax rate decreased in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily due to differences in the mix of diamond offshores domestic and international pretax earnings and losses. also contributing to the lower 2014 effective tax rate was the reversal of $55 million ($27 million after noncontrolling interests) of reserves for uncertain tax positions in various foreign jurisdictions which were settled in diamond offshores favor or for which the statute of limitations had expired. the 2013 period was negatively impacted by a provision of $57 million ($27 million after noncontrolling interests) related to an uncertain tax position in egypt, partially offset by the impact of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012, which reduced income tax expense by $28 million ($13 million after noncontrolling interests).
as diamond offshores rigs frequently operate in different tax jurisdictions as they move from contract to contract, its effective tax rate can fluctuate substantially and its historical effective tax rates may not be sustainable and could increase materially.
2013 compared with 2012
contract drilling revenue decreased $92 million in 2013 as compared with 2012, while contract drilling expense increased $36 million during the same period. contract drilling revenue was negatively impacted by a decrease in revenue earned by diamond offshores ultra-deepwater and mid-water fleets, partially offset by favorable revenue variances for its deepwater and jack-up rigs. the increase in contract drilling expense reflects higher labor and personnel related costs primarily as a result of mid-2013 pay increases and costs associated with additional crews for diamond offshores new rigs expected to be delivered in 2014 and for the ocean onyx delivered in the fourth quarter of 2013, higher repairs and maintenance and inspection costs, partially offset by decreased mobilization and freight costs.
revenue generated by ultra-deepwater floaters decreased $48 million in 2013 as compared with 2012, due to decreased utilization of $30 million and lower average daily revenue of $18 million. the decrease in revenue earning days is primarily due to incremental unplanned downtime, partially offset by a reduction in downtime for shipyard projects and inspections. the decrease in average daily revenue is primarily due to a contract extension for the ocean rover at a significantly lower dayrate than previously earned and an $18 million decrease in amortized mobilization revenue. however, average daily revenue for 2013 was favorably impacted by $25 million of revenue recognized in connection with a settlement agreement entered into with a customer. the settlement agreement related to amounts due to diamond offshore during 2013 for which revenue was not recognized due to the financial condition of the customer. amortized mobilization revenue decreased primarily due to the recognition of mobilization revenue in the 2012 period associated with the ocean monarchs mobilization to vietnam.
revenue generated by deepwater floaters increased $19 million in 2013 as compared with 2012, as a result of higher average daily revenue of $47 million, partially offset by a decrease in utilization of $28 million. average daily revenue increased in 2013 primarily due to the ocean valiant and ocean victory both working at significantly higher dayrates than those rigs earned in 2012, partially offset by lower amortized mobilization revenue of $5 million. the decline in revenue earning days is due to incremental unscheduled downtime for repairs, scheduled shipyard projects and mobilization of the ocean america.
71
revenue generated by mid-water floaters decreased $77 million in 2013 as compared with 2012, as a result of decreased utilization of $124 million, partially offset by higher average daily revenue of $47 million. revenue earning days decreased primarily due to an increase in planned downtime for shipyard inspections and projects, cold stacking of a rig and non-revenue earning days associated with two customer contracts, partially offset by fewer days for the mobilization of rigs. the increase in average daily revenue is primarily due to new contracts and contract renewals for four rigs at higher dayrates than previously earned.
revenue generated by jack-up rigs increased $14 million in 2013 as compared with 2012, primarily due to utilization of a rig which was warm stacked in 2012 earning $26 million of revenue in 2013, partially offset by the absence of revenue attributable to six jack-up rigs that diamond offshore sold in 2012. these rigs earned aggregate revenue of $5 million in 2012. revenues in 2013 were further reduced by scheduled downtime for repairs for two jack-up rigs.
net income decreased $80 million in 2013 as compared with 2012 reflecting the decline in revenue, increase in contract drilling expense and recognition of bad debt expense of $23 million ($9 million after tax and noncontrolling interests), partially offset by lower interest expense. the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in interest capitalized on eligible construction projects in 2013, partially offset by incremental interest expense for the $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in 2013 and interest expense associated with uncertain tax positions in the mexico tax jurisdiction. net income for 2012 also included a $76 million gain ($32 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) on the sale of six jack-up rigs and an impairment loss of $62 million ($19 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) recognized on three mid-water floaters.
diamond offshores effective tax rate in 2013 increased as compared with 2012. the higher effective tax rate in 2013 is primarily the result of differences in the mix of diamond offshores domestic and international pretax earnings and losses, as well as the international jurisdictions in which diamond offshore operates and a $57 million ($27 million after noncontrolling interests) charge related to an uncertain tax position for egyptian operations. the increase in the effective rate is partially offset by the recognition of the impact of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012, which reduced 2013 income tax expense by $28 million ($13 million after noncontrolling interests). the act, which was signed into law on january 2, 2013, extended through 2013 several expired temporary business provisions, commonly referred to as extenders which were retroactively extended to the beginning of 2012.
boardwalk pipeline boardwalk pipeline derives revenues primarily from the transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids (ngls) and gathering and processing of natural gas for third parties. transportation services consist of firm natural gas transportation, where the customer pays a capacity reservation charge to reserve pipeline capacity at receipt and delivery points along pipeline systems, plus a commodity and fuel charge on the volume of natural gas actually transported, and interruptible natural gas transportation, where the customer pays to transport gas only when capacity is available and used. boardwalk pipeline offers firm natural gas storage services in which the customer reserves and pays for a specific amount of storage capacity, including injection and withdrawal rights, and interruptible storage and parking and lending (pal) services where the customer receives and pays for capacity only when it is available and used. boardwalk pipeline also transports and stores ngls. boardwalk pipelines ngl contracts are generally fee-based and are dependent on actual volumes transported or stored, although in some cases minimum volume requirements apply. boardwalk pipelines ngl storage rates are market-based and contracts are typically fixed price arrangements with escalation clauses. boardwalk pipeline is not in the business of buying and selling natural gas and ngls other than for system management purposes, but changes in the level of natural gas and ngls prices may impact the volumes of natural gas or ngls transported and stored on its pipeline systems. boardwalk pipelines operating costs and expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount of products transported, with the exception of fuel consumed at its compressor stations.
72
market conditions and contract renewals boardwalk pipeline provides natural gas transportation services to customers that are directly connected to its pipeline system and, through interconnects with third-party pipelines, to customers that are not directly connected to its system. transportation rates that boardwalk pipeline is able to charge customers are heavily influenced by longer term trends in, for example, the amount and geographical location of natural gas production and demand for gas by end-users such as power plants, petrochemical facilities and liquefied natural gas (lng) export facilities. as a result of changes in longer term trends such as the development of gas production from the marcellus and utica production areas located in the northeastern u.s. and changes to related pipeline infrastructure, basis differentials corresponding to traditional flow patterns on boardwalk pipelines natural gas pipeline systems (generally south to north and west to east) have narrowed significantly in recent years, reducing the transportation rates and adversely impacting other contract terms that can be negotiated with customers for available transportation capacity and for contracts due for renewal for boardwalk pipelines transportation services. these conditions have had and are expected to continue to have a material adverse affect on boardwalk pipelines revenues, earnings and distributable cash flow.
a substantial portion of boardwalk pipelines transportation capacity is contracted for under firm transportation agreements. actual revenues recognized from capacity reservation and minimum bill charges for the year ended december 31, 2014 were $887 million. approximate projected revenues from capacity reservation and minimum bill charges under committed firm transportation agreements in place as of december 31, 2014, for each of the full years 2015 and 2016 are $910 million and $900 million. included in these revenues for 2015 and 2016 are $4 million and $25 million, which are anticipated under executed precedent transportation agreements for projects that are subject to regulatory approval to commence construction, and these projects are subject to the risk that they may not be completed, may be impacted by significant cost overruns or may be materially changed prior to completion as a result of future developments or circumstances that boardwalk pipeline cannot predict at this time. additional revenues boardwalk pipeline has recognized or may receive under firm transportation agreements based on actual utilization of the contracted pipeline facilities or any expected revenues for periods after the expiration dates of the existing agreements or execution of precedent agreements associated with growth projects or events that occurred subsequent to december 31, 2014 are not included in these amounts.
each year a portion of boardwalk pipelines firm transportation agreements expire and need to be renewed or replaced. due to the factors noted above, in recent periods boardwalk pipeline has generally seen the renewal of expiring transportation contracts at lower rates and for shorter terms than in the past which has materially adversely impacted transportation revenues. capacity not renewed and available for sale on a short term basis has been and continues to be sold at rates reflective of basis spreads, which generally have been lower than historical rates, under short term firm or interruptible contracts, or in some cases not sold at all. rates for short term and interruptible transportation services are influenced by the factors discussed above but can be more heavily affected by shorter term conditions such as current and forecasted weather. for a discussion of additional risks associated with boardwalk pipelines revenues, please see item 1a. risk factors  boardwalk pipeline  boardwalk pipeline may not be able to replace expiring gas transportation contracts at attractive rates or on a long term basis and may not be able to sell short term services at attractive rates or at all due to narrower basis differentials which adversely affect the value of its transportation services.
boardwalk pipeline is beginning to experience an increase in demand to transport gas from north to south instead of south to north as has been the traditional flow pattern. this demand is being driven by increases in gas production from primarily the marcellus and utica production areas and growing demand for natural gas primarily in the gulf coast area from new and planned power plants, petrochemical facilities and lng export facilities. this new flow pattern is resulting in potential growth project opportunities that require significant capital expenditures, among other things, to make parts of boardwalk pipelines system bi-directional, and in many instances, will utilize existing pipeline capacity made available by customers that have not renewed expiring contracts. these projects have lengthy planning and construction periods and as a result, will not contribute to boardwalk pipelines earnings and cash flows until they are placed into service over the next several years. in some instances the projects remain subject to regulatory approval to commence construction, and these projects are subject to the risk that they may not be completed, may be impacted by significant cost overruns or may be materially changed prior to completion as a result of future developments or circumstances that we cannot predict at this time.
73
in the second half of 2014, oil prices declined significantly and the outlook for oil prices indicated that prices could remain depressed for the foreseeable future. in 2014, approximately 51% of boardwalk pipelines revenues were generated from contracts with natural gas producers, a significant number of which are integrated oil companies. further, several of boardwalk pipelines growth projects are supported by contracts with oil companies. should the price of oil remain at its current level for a sustained period of time, boardwalk pipeline could be exposed to increased credit risk associated with the producer customer group.
the value of boardwalk pipelines storage and pal services (comprised of parking gas for customers and/or lending gas to customers) is affected by natural gas price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time period price spreads), price volatility of natural gas and other factors. boardwalk pipeline has seen the value of its storage and pal services adversely impacted by some of the market factors discussed above which have contributed to a narrowing of time period price spreads, which in turn has reduced the rates boardwalk pipeline can charge and the capacity it can sell under storage and pal services. boardwalk pipelines storage and parking services have greater value when the natural gas futures market is in contango (a positive time period price spread meaning that current price quotes for delivery of natural gas further in the future are higher than in the nearer term), while boardwalk pipelines lending service has greater value when the futures market is backwardated (a negative time period price spread, meaning that current price quotes for delivery of natural gas in the nearer term are higher than further in the future). during the first half of 2014, the futures market was significantly backwardated, partly reflecting the harsh weather conditions in late 2013 and early 2014 and boardwalk pipeline earned revenues from lending gas to customers under pal services. since then, the futures market has reverted to a contango market, although time period price spreads remain relatively narrow. storage market fundamentals can be volatile in a relatively short period of time. based on the current narrowing of time period price spreads and fewer market participants due to a decrease in the number of marketers taking storage positions, boardwalk pipeline is currently experiencing weakened demand for its storage and pal services.
pipeline system maintenance boardwalk pipeline incurs substantial costs for ongoing maintenance of its pipeline systems and related facilities, including those incurred for pipeline integrity management activities, equipment overhauls, general upkeep and repairs. these costs are not dependent on the amount of revenues earned from boardwalk pipelines natural gas transportation services. the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration (phmsa) has developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in highly populated areas. these regulations have resulted in an overall increase in boardwalk pipelines ongoing maintenance costs, including maintenance capital and maintenance expense. phmsa has proposed more stringent regulations, which if implemented, could require boardwalk pipeline to incur significant additional costs.
maintenance costs may be capitalized or expensed, depending on the nature of the activities. for any given reporting period, the mix of projects that boardwalk pipeline undertakes will affect the amounts recorded as property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets or recognize as expenses, which impacts its earnings.
in january of 2015, boardwalk pipeline experienced a pipeline rupture on its gulf south pipeline in a remote area north of jackson, mississippi. as a result, boardwalk pipeline took that pipeline out of service and reduced operating pressures on certain other pipeline sections. the ruptured pipeline has been repaired, though it will not be returned to service until approval has been received from phmsa. the pipeline rupture occurred at a time when boardwalk pipeline was beginning to reassess its pipeline integrity plans, particularly in light of new project opportunities. to accommodate these opportunities and otherwise ensure the integrity of boardwalk pipelines pipeline systems, over the next four years, boardwalk pipeline will upgrade sections of its pipeline systems, resulting in additional capital expenditures.
74
acquisition of the evangeline pipeline system in october of 2014, boardwalk pipeline acquired boardwalk petrochemical, formerly known as chevron petrochemical pipeline, llc, which owns and operates the evangeline ethylene pipeline system (evangeline) for $295 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments. the purchase price was funded through borrowings under the revolving credit facility. the evangeline system is an approximately 180-mile interstate pipeline, that when fully operational, is expected to be capable of transporting approximately 2.6 billion pounds of ethylene per year between port neches, texas, and baton rouge, louisiana, and is supported by long term, fee-based contracts. the acquisition was made as part of boardwalk pipelines long term growth and diversification strategy and to complement boardwalk pipelines existing ngls and ethylene midstream assets. shortly after the acquisition, a leak was discovered on the pipeline. boardwalk pipeline has taken the pipeline out of service while it inspects the pipeline and works to comply with a corrective action order issued by phmsa. the inspection process is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2015, although boardwalk pipeline is uncertain at this time when the remedial work will be completed or this pipeline will be returned to service, which is subject to approval by phmsa.
gulf south rate case in october of 2014, boardwalk pipelines gulf south subsidiary filed a rate case with the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) pursuant to section 4 of the natural gas act of 1938 (docket no. rp15-65), requesting, among other things, a reconfiguration of the transportation rate zones on its system and, in general, an increase in its tariff rates. the new tariff rates are expected to become effective may 1, 2015, subject to refund, which means that boardwalk pipeline will be responsible for refunds if the ferc later finds that the proposed rates are not just and reasonable. the rate case is in the initial stages, therefore, the ultimate outcome and impacts on boardwalk pipelines earnings and cash flows for 2015 and beyond cannot be predicted at this time.

2014 compared with 2013
total revenues increased $4 million in 2014, compared with 2013. this increase is primarily due to a $27 million increase in transportation and other revenues generally due to the colder than normal winter weather in boardwalk pipelines market areas and growth projects which were recently placed into service, partially offset by lower firm transportation revenues due to the effects of the market and contract renewal conditions discussed above. additionally, revenues increased $13 million from fuel retained primarily due to higher natural gas prices and $15
75
million from gas sales associated with the flag city processing plant, which were offset by gas purchases recorded in operating expenses. storage and parking and lending revenues were lower by $22 million primarily as a result of the effects of unfavorable market conditions on natural gas time period price spreads. the 2013 period was favorably impacted by a $30 million gain from the sale of storage gas.
operating expenses increased $155 million in 2014, compared with 2013. this increase is primarily due to a charge of $94 million to write off previously capitalized costs incurred for the bluegrass project, a project with the williams companies, inc. which was dissolved due to cost escalations, construction delays and lack of customer commitments. the higher operating expenses were also caused by a $27 million increase in fuel and transportation expenses primarily driven by gas purchases for the flag city processing plant which were offset in revenues and the effects of higher natural gas prices on fuel, a $17 million increase in depreciation expense primarily due to an increase in the asset base and a $12 million increase in operation and maintenance expenses primarily due to increased maintenance expense projects.
net income for 2014 decreased $60 million as compared to 2013 period primarily reflecting the bluegrass project related charge and higher operations, maintenance and depreciation expense, partially offset by the prior year goodwill impairment charge of $16 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) discussed further below.
2013 compared with 2012
total revenues increased $48 million in 2013 as compared with 2012. this increase is primarily due to $63 million of revenues earned from boardwalk louisiana midstream llc (louisiana midstream), acquired in october of 2012, a $30 million gain from the sale of storage gas and an increase in fuel revenues of $9 million primarily due to higher natural gas prices. the increase in revenues was partially offset by the market conditions discussed above, resulting in lower transportation revenues, excluding fuel, of $53 million and $4 million of reduced storage and pal revenues.
operating expenses increased $59 million in 2013, compared to 2012. this increase is primarily due to $38 million of expenses incurred by louisiana midstream, higher depreciation and property taxes of $9 million due to an increase in the asset base and increased fuel costs of $6 million due to higher natural gas prices.
boardwalk pipeline recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $52 million ($16 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) for the year ended december 31, 2013, representing the carrying value of goodwill related to its reporting unit which included goodwill associated with the acquisition of petal gas storage, llc (formerly referred to as boardwalk hp storage company, llc) in december of 2011. the fair value of the reporting unit declined from the amount determined in 2012 primarily due to the recent narrowing of time period price spreads and reduced volatility which negatively affects the value of boardwalk pipelines storage and pal services and the cumulative effect of reduced basis spreads on the value of boardwalk pipelines transportation services.
net income decreased $31 million in 2013 as compared with 2012 reflecting higher revenues offset by increased expenses as discussed above. the percentage of income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased as a result of equity offerings in 2012 and 2013 by boardwalk pipeline, decreasing our ownership percentage from 59% in 2012 to 54% in 2013.

2014 compared with 2013
operating revenues increased $75 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to current year acquisitions and the reopening in january of 2014 of the loews regency hotel in new york, which was closed for renovation in 2013. these increases were partially offset by the reduction in revenue recognized by loews hotels as a result of the sale of equity interests in two hotels in july of 2013. for periods following the sale of these equity interests, loews hotels share of earnings or losses for these hotels is included in equity income from joint ventures.
reimbursable expenses relate mainly to payroll incurred by loews hotels on behalf of the owners of joint venture and managed hotel properties.
revenue per available room (revpar) is an industry measure of the combined effect of occupancy rates and average room rates on room revenues. other hotel operating revenues, not included in revpar, primarily include guest charges for food and beverages. revpar for owned and joint venture hotels increased $14.19 to $182.86 in 2014 as compared to 2013, driven by an increase in both occupancy and average room rates. revpar in 2014 was favorably impacted by the reopening of the loews regency hotel which had a higher revpar than the hotel portfolio average and negatively impacted by the addition of three hotels which operate at a lower revpar than the hotel portfolio average.
operating expenses increased $52 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to the addition of three hotels and the reopening of the loews regency hotel, partially offset by a reduction in expenses as a result of the sale of equity interests in two hotels.
equity income from joint venture properties increased $12 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. the increase was primarily due to improved performance of the universal orlando properties, including the addition of universals cabana bay beach resort.
interest expense increased $5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to the refinancing of a $125 million mortgage loan for a new $300 million mortgage loan and incremental interest expense from property-level debt incurred to fund acquisitions. these increases were partially offset by the reduction in interest expense as a result of the sale of equity interests in two hotels.
77
2013 compared with 2012
operating revenues decreased by $46 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to the 2013 closure of the loews regency hotel.
revpar for owned and joint venture hotels decreased $5.41 to $168.67 in 2013 as compared to 2012, reflecting a decrease in occupancy and average room rates. excluding the loews regency hotel which was closed for renovation throughout 2013, revpar increased $3.76 for 2013 as compared to 2012, reflecting an increase in average room rates.
operating expenses decreased $40 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to the closure of the loews regency hotel, partially offset by higher corporate expenses related to hotels recently acquired and under development. in addition, expenses were reduced by $3 million and $7 million in 2013 and 2012 related to recoveries of a loan guarantee payment.
equity income from joint venture properties decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to the impact of renovations and the development of joint venture properties.
corporate and other corporate and other operations consist primarily of investment income at the parent company, corporate interest expenses and other corporate administrative costs. investment income includes earnings on cash and short term investments held at the parent company level to meet current and future liquidity needs, as well as results of limited partnership investments and the trading portfolio.

liquidity and capital resources cna financial cash flows cnas primary operating cash flow sources are premiums and investment income from its insurance subsidiaries. cnas primary operating cash flow uses are payments for claims, policy benefits and operating expenses, including interest expense on corporate debt. additionally, cash may be paid or received for income taxes.
for 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion as compared with $1.2 billion for 2013. in 2014, cash provided by operating activities reflected increased receipts relating to returns on limited partnerships and lower net claim payments, substantially offset by increased tax payments. additionally, in 2013 cna contributed $75 million to the cna retirement plan. net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion in 2012. operating cash flows in 2013 reflected increased claim payments, partially offset by increased premium receipts.
cash flows from investing activities include the purchase and disposition of available-for-sale financial instruments and may include the purchase and sale of businesses, land, buildings, equipment and other assets not generally held for resale.
79
net cash used by investing activities was $918 million for 2014, as compared with $898 million and $934 million for 2013 and 2012. the cash flow from investing activities is affected by various factors such as the anticipated payment of claims, financing activity, asset/liability management and individual security buy and sell decisions made in the normal course of portfolio management.
cash flows from financing activities may include proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities, outflows for shareholder dividends or repayment of debt and outlays to reacquire equity instruments. net cash used by financing activities was $519 million, $264 million and $239 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012.
liquidity cna believes that its present cash flows from operations, investing activities and financing activities are sufficient to fund its current and expected working capital and debt obligation needs and cna does not expect this to change in the near term. there are currently no amounts outstanding under cnas $250 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility and no borrowings outstanding through cnas membership in the federal home loan bank of chicago (fhlbc).
cna has an effective registration statement on form s-3 registering the future sale of an unlimited amount of its debt and equity securities.
dividends dividends of $2.00 per share of cnas common stock, including a special dividend of $1.00 per share, were declared and paid in 2014. on february 6, 2015, cnas board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share and a special dividend of $2.00 per share, payable march 12, 2015 to shareholders of record on february 23, 2015. the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of cnas board of directors and will depend on many factors, including cnas earnings, financial condition, business needs, and regulatory constraints.
ratings ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. cnas insurance company subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies and these ratings reflect the rating agencys opinion of the insurance companys financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating. one or more of these agencies could take action in the future to change the ratings of cnas insurance subsidiaries.
the table below reflects the various group ratings issued by a.m. best company (a.m. best), moodys investors service, inc. (moodys) and standard & poors (s&p) as of december 31, 2014. the table also includes the ratings for cna senior debt.

diamond offshore cash and investments totaled $250 million at december 31, 2014, compared to $2.1 billion at december 31, 2013. in 2014, diamond offshore paid cash dividends totaling $486 million, consisting of aggregate regular cash dividends of $69 million and aggregate special cash dividends of $417 million. on february 6, 2015, diamond offshore declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share.
cash provided by operating activities in 2014 was $993 million, compared to $1.1 billion in 2013, a decrease of $73 million, primarily due to higher cash payments related to contract drilling expenses of $77 million and higher interest payments of $51 million on senior notes. the increase in cash outflows for 2014 was partially offset by lower cash income taxes paid in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and a slight increase in cash receipts from contract drilling services of $7 million.
diamond offshore is currently obligated under separate agreements in connection with two ongoing rig construction projects. the following is a summary of diamond offshores construction projects as of december 31, 2014:

(a)   represents expected delivery date of vessel from shipyard and does not include additional non-operating days for commissioning, contract preparation and mobilization to initial area of operation, which will occur prior to the rig being placed in service.

(b)   total project costs include contractual payments for shipyard construction, commissioning, capital spares and project management costs, and does not include capitalized interest.

(c)   represents total project expenditures, including accrued expenditures, from inception of project to december 31, 2014, excluding project-to-date capitalized interest.

for 2015, diamond offshore has budgeted approximately $944 million for capital expenditures of which approximately $602 million is expected to be spent on current rig construction projects. the remainder will be spent on diamond offshores ongoing capital maintenance and replacement programs.
depending on market and other conditions, diamond offshore may purchase shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise. in 2014, diamond offshore purchased 1.9 million shares of its outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $88 million.
in september of 2014, diamond offshore repaid at maturity the entire $250 million principal amount of its 5.2% senior notes.
diamond offshore has a $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, to be used for general corporate purposes, which matures in 2019. diamond offshore also has the option to increase the revolving commitments under the credit agreement by up to an additional $500 million from time to time, upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders, and to request up to two additional one-year extensions of the maturity date. the entire amount of the facility is available, subject to its terms, for revolving loans. as of december 31, 2014, there were no loans or letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement.
during the third quarter of 2014, s&p revised its outlook on diamond offshore to negative from stable and in december of 2014, lowered its corporate credit and unsecured debt ratings from a to a-. in february of 2015, moodys and s&p assigned short-term credit ratings of prime-2 and a2 to diamond offshores commercial paper program. concurrently, moodys and s&p affirmed diamond offshores long term corporate credit rating of a3 and
81
a-. market conditions and other factors, many of which are outside of diamond offshores control, could cause its credit ratings to be lowered. a downgrade in diamond offshores credit ratings could impact its cost of issuing additional debt and the amount of additional debt that it could issue, a series of downgrades or a substantial downgrade could restrict diamond offshores access to capital markets and its ability to raise additional debt or rollover existing maturities. as a consequence, diamond offshore may not be able to issue additional debt in amounts and/or with terms that it considers to be reasonable. one or more of these occurrences could limit diamond offshores ability to pursue other business opportunities.
in february of 2015, diamond offshore established a commercial paper program with three commercial paper dealers pursuant to which it may issue, on a private placement basis, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.5 billion. proceeds from issuances under the commercial paper program may be used for general corporate purposes. the maturities of the notes may vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. diamond offshores credit facility provides liquidity for the payment obligations in respect of the notes issued under the commercial paper program, and unless terms of the program are changed, the aggregate amount of notes outstanding at any time will not exceed the amount available under the credit facility. as of the date of this report, diamond offshore had no commercial paper notes outstanding.
as a result of diamond offshores intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of its wholly owned subsidiary, diamond offshore international limited (doil), to finance its foreign activities, diamond offshore does not expect such earnings to be available for distribution to its stockholders or to finance its domestic activities. diamond offshore believes that the operating cash flows generated by and cash reserves of doil, and the operating cash flows available to and cash reserves of diamond offshore will be sufficient to meet both its working capital requirements and its capital commitments. however, in light of the significant cash requirements of diamond offshores capital expansion program in 2015 and 2016, diamond offshore may make use of its credit facility or commercial paper program to finance its capital expenditures and working capital requirements. diamond offshore will continue to make periodic assessments of its capital spending programs based on industry conditions and will adjust capital spending programs if required. diamond offshore, may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. diamond offshores ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity securities will be dependent on its results of operations, current financial condition, current credit ratings, current market conditions and other factors beyond its control.

in september of 2014, boardwalk pipeline repaid $25 million principal of its variable rate term loan. the outstanding borrowing of $200 million is due in october of 2017. no additional borrowing capacity is available under this term loan.
in november of 2014, boardwalk pipeline issued $350 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior notes due december 15, 2024. boardwalk pipeline used a portion of the $343 million in net proceeds to retire all of the outstanding $275 million aggregate principal amount of 5.1% notes due 2015 on february 2, 2015, and the remainder of the net proceeds was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
boardwalk pipelines revolving credit facility, which matures in april of 2017, has aggregate lending commitments of $1.0 billion. as of february 18, 2015, boardwalk pipeline had outstanding borrowings of $460 million resulting in $540 million of available borrowing capacity and is in compliance with all covenant requirements under the credit facility.
boardwalk pipeline anticipates that for 2015 its existing capital resources, including the revolving credit facility, cash flows from operating activities and the subordinated loan agreement with a subsidiary of the company to provide $300 million of financing will be adequate to fund its operations, including its planned capital expenditures. the subordinated loan agreement provides for a draw period through december 31, 2015 and matures in july of 2024, subject to certain mandatory pre-payment requirements. boardwalk pipeline may seek to access the capital markets to fund some or all capital expenditures for future growth projects or acquisitions, or to repay or refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness, a significant amount of which matures in the next five years.
most of boardwalk pipelines senior unsecured debt is rated by independent credit rating agencies. boardwalk pipelines credit ratings affect its ability to access the public and private debt markets, as well as the terms and the cost of borrowings. the ability to satisfy financing requirements or fund planned growth capital expenditures will depend upon boardwalk pipelines future operating performance and the ability to access the capital markets, which are affected by economic factors in its industry as well as other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond boardwalk pipelines control. the table below reflects the various group ratings issued by s&p, moodys and fitch ratings, inc. (fitch) for boardwalk pipelines senior unsecured notes and that of its operating subsidiaries having outstanding rated debt as of february 18, 2015.

investments investment activities of non-insurance subsidiaries primarily include investments in fixed income securities, including short term investments. the parent company portfolio also includes equity securities, including short sales and derivative instruments, and investments in limited partnerships. these types of investments generally present greater volatility, less liquidity and greater risk than fixed income investments and are included within results of operations  corporate and other.
we enter into short sales and invest in certain derivative instruments that are used for asset and liability management activities, income enhancements to our portfolio management strategy and to benefit from anticipated future movements in the underlying markets. if such movements do not occur as anticipated, then significant losses may occur. monitoring procedures include senior management review of daily detailed reports of existing positions and valuation fluctuations to ensure that open positions are consistent with our portfolio strategy.
credit exposure associated with non-performance by the counterparties to derivative instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized change in fair value of the derivative instruments recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. we mitigate the risk of non-performance by monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties and diversifying derivatives to multiple counterparties. we occasionally require collateral from our derivative investment counterparties depending on the amount of the exposure and the credit rating of the counterparty.
insurance cna maintains a large portfolio of fixed maturity and equity securities, including large amounts of corporate and government issued debt securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and other asset-backed securities and investments in limited partnerships which pursue a variety of long and short investment strategies across a broad array of asset classes. cnas investment portfolio supports its obligation to pay future insurance claims and provides investment returns which are an important part of cnas overall profitability.

net investment income after tax and noncontrolling interests increased $111 million in 2013 as compared with 2012. the increase was driven by a significant increase in limited partnership investment income. limited partnership results were positively affected by more favorable equity market returns.

net realized investment gains increased $22 million in 2014 as compared with 2013, driven by higher net realized investment gains on sales of securities. net realized investment gains decreased $20 million in 2013 as compared with 2012, driven by lower net realized investment gains on sales of securities, partially offset by lower other-than-temporary impairment (otti) losses recognized in earnings. further information on cnas realized gains and losses, including cnas otti losses and impairment decision process, is set forth in notes 1 and 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
portfolio quality cnas fixed maturity portfolio consists primarily of high quality bonds, 92.8% and 92.1% of which were rated as investment grade (rated bbb- or higher) at december 31, 2014 and 2013. the classification between investment grade and non-investment grade is based on a ratings methodology that takes into account ratings from s&p and moodys, in that order of preference. if a security is not rated by these agencies, cna formulates an internal rating. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 99% of the fixed maturity portfolio was rated by s&p or moodys, or was issued or guaranteed by the u.s. government, government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises.

duration a primary objective in the management of the investment portfolio is to optimize return relative to corresponding liabilities and respective liquidity needs. cnas views on the current interest rate environment, tax regulations, asset class valuations, specific security issuer and broader industry segment conditions and the domestic and global economic conditions, are some of the factors that enter into an investment decision. cna also continually monitors exposure to issuers of securities held and broader industry sector exposures and may from time to time adjust such exposures based on its views of a specific issuer or industry sector.
a further consideration in the management of the investment portfolio is the characteristics of the corresponding liabilities and the ability to align the duration of the portfolio to those liabilities and to meet future liquidity needs, minimize interest rate risk and maintain a level of income sufficient to support the underlying insurance liabilities. for portfolios where future liability cash flows are determinable and typically long term in nature, cna segregates investments for asset/liability management purposes. the segregated investments support the long term care and structured settlement liabilities in life & group non-core.
the effective durations of fixed maturity securities, short term investments and interest rate derivatives are presented in the table below. short term investments are net of accounts payable and receivable amounts for securities purchased and sold, but not yet settled.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. we encourage you to read this md&a in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k and the "risk factors" contained in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k ("form 10-k").
unless otherwise indicated, financial information in the md&a is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company's significant accounting policies. we measure the financial results of our segments using "segment earnings (loss)", defined as shareholders' net income (loss) before after-tax realized investment results. in this md&a, we also present information using adjusted income from operations on both a consolidated and segment basis. adjusted income (loss) from operations is another measure of profitability used by our management because it presents the underlying results of operations of our businesses and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and shareholders' net income. adjusted income (loss) from operations is defined as segment earnings (loss) excluding special items (described in the table on page 36 of this form 10-k) and results of the gmib business. this measure is not determined in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable gaap measures, which are shareholders' net income on a consolidated basis and segment earnings (loss) on a segment basis. we exclude special items because management does not believe they are representative of our underlying results of operations. we also exclude the results of the gmib business because, prior to february 4, 2013, the changes in the fair value of gmib assets and liabilities were volatile and unpredictable. in some of our financial tables in this md&a, we present either percentage changes or "n/m" when those changes are so large as to become not meaningful, and changes in percentages are expressed in basis points ("bps").

our segments as explained in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, effective with the first quarter of 2014, we began combining the results of our run-off reinsurance business with other immaterial operating segments in other operations for segment reporting purposes. prior year segment information has been conformed to the current year presentation.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we present the financial results of our businesses in the following three reportable segments:
segment                                    % of revenues               description global health care                         78%                         aggregates the commercial and government operating segments:
commercial
                                                                                       encompasses both our u.s. commercial and certain international health care businesses.
                                                                                       serves employers and their employees, including globally mobile individuals, and other groups (e.g., governmental and non-governmental organizations, unions and associations). in addition, our u.s.
commercial health care business also serves individuals.
                                                                                       offers insured and self-insured medical, dental, behavioral health, vision, and prescription drug benefit plans, health advocacy programs and other products and services that may be integrated as part of a comprehensive global health care benefit program.
government
                                                                                       offers medicare advantage, medicare part d and medicaid plans.
global supplemental benefits               9%                          offers supplemental health, life and accident insurance products in selected international markets and the u.s.
group disability and life                  11%                         offers group long-term and short-term disability, group life, accident and specialty insurance products and related services.
we present the remainder of our segment results in other operations, consisting of the corporate-owned life insurance business ("coli"), run-off reinsurance and settlement annuity businesses and deferred gains associated with the sales of the individual life insurance and annuity and retirement benefits businesses.
key transactions and other significant items the following is a summary of key transactions and other significant items since january 1, 2012 affecting period-to-period comparisons of our results.
run-off reinsurance transaction.    prior to february 4, 2013, our run-off reinsurance business had significant exposures, primarily from our guaranteed minimum death benefits ("gmdb" also known as "vadbe") and guaranteed minimum income benefits ("gmib") businesses. effective february 4, 2013, we entered into an agreement with berkshire to reinsure future exposures for this business, net of existing retrocessional arrangements, up to a specified limit, for a payment of $2.2 billion. the reinsurance transaction aligned with our strategy of increasing financial flexibility by accomplishing an effective exit from the gmdb and gmib businesses. as a result of this transaction, we recorded an after-tax charge of $507 million in the first quarter of 2013 that was reported as a special item. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and the other operations section of this md&a for additional information.
pharmacy benefit management ("pbm") services agreement.    in june 2013, we entered into a 10-year pharmacy benefit management services agreement with catamaran corporation. under this agreement, we utilize their technology and service platforms, retail network contracting and claims processing services. in the second quarter of 2013, we recorded one-time transaction costs of $37 million pre-tax ($24 million after-tax) that were reported as a special item. this arrangement has produced a positive contribution to earnings in 2014 through improved clinical management, purchasing and administrative efficiencies.
organizational efficiency plans.    we regularly evaluate ways to deliver our products and services more efficiently and at a lower cost. during 2013 and 2012, we adopted specific plans to increase our organizational efficiency, resulting in a charge of $60 million pre-tax ($40 million after-tax) in 2013 and $77 million pre-tax ($50 million after-tax in 2012. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with the terms of the agreement upon re-examination, we may be subject to additional fines or penalties. in addition to the monitoring states, most other jurisdictions have joined the agreement as participating, non-monitoring states.
health care industry developments health care reform and the implementing regulations have resulted in broad changes that are meaningfully impacting the industry, including relationships with customers and health care providers, the design of products and services, and pricing and delivery systems. in 2013, the industry saw government-prescribed reductions to medicare reimbursement rates (i.e., sequestration), ongoing payment reductions for medicare advantage plans by the centers for medicare and medicaid services ("cms") and changes in requirements associated with operational and performance metrics used to determine medicare advantage payments and benefits. for 2014, there have been further changes resulting from health care reform and the implementing regulations including public exchanges, a non-deductible industry tax in addition to fees and assessments, and minimum medical loss ratio requirements for medicare advantage and medicare part d plans. collectively, these changes have had a significant impact on our business and customers, requiring adjustments to our business model to mitigate their effects on our results of operations and cash flows.
the "regulation" section of this form 10-k provides a detailed and up-to-date description of health care reform provisions and other legislative initiatives that impact our domestic health care business, including regulations issued by cms and the departments of the treasury and health and human services ("hhs"). the table presented below provides a summary of the financial impacts of key provisions of health care reform in 2014 and beyond.
item                                                                  description medicare advantage ("ma") and part d program impacts                  sequestration: as a result of sequestration, federal government reimbursement rates for ma and part d were lowered by 2% beginning april 1, 2013. this program is expected to
 sequestration  ma rates  medical loss ratio (ma and               run through 2023. while these rate reductions significantly impact our government operating segment, their overall effect on consolidated net income and cash flows was immaterial in 2013 and 2014 and is expected to continue to be immaterial.
part d)                                                               ma rates: in april 2014, cms published its notice of final federal government reimbursement rates for calendar year 2015. based on industry data, overall ma rates for 2015 are expected to be
2% lower than 2014 for ma carriers. assuming a similar book of business to 2014, we would expect a 2% rate decrease to lower full-year 2015 ma premiums by approximately $100 million. we do not expect these lower rates to have a significant impact on our 2015 net income or cash flows based on our 2015 bid submissions that included adjustments to our programs and services to reflect the 2015 rates.
the 2014 federal government reimbursement rates established by cms included a variety of payment reductions to medicare plans. overall, these rates were reduced by approximately 6% compared with 2013. assuming a similar book of business to 2013, we estimated this rate decrease would lower full-year 2014 ma premiums by approximately $300 million. in 2014, premium decreases related to the cms rate reductions have been partially mitigated through changes in member risk scores and customer enrollment mix (in total, and by county).
these rate reductions, together with the impact of the health insurance industry tax, have negatively impacted margins for the government operating segment.
medical loss ratio ("mlr"): beginning in 2014, if our mlr for ma or part d business is less than the required 85% minimum, we will be required to pay a rebate to cms. the effect of these mlr rebates was not material to our results of operations or cash flows in 2014.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item                                            description health care reform taxes and fees               health insurance industry tax: see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. in 2014, we recognized $238 million in operating expenses for the
 industry tax                                  industry tax. because this tax is not deductible for federal income tax purposes, our effective tax rate increased in 2014, both on a consolidated basis and for the global health care segment. of the full-year tax, $134 million relates to our commercial business and the remaining $104 million relates to our medicare business. for our commercial business, we incorporated the 2014 fees into our targeted pricing actions. for our medicare business, although we have partially mitigated the effect of the tax through benefit changes and customer premium increases, the combination of the tax and lower ma rates in 2014 have contributed to lower margins in the government operating segment in 2014. see the consolidated results of operations and global health care segment sections of this md&amp;a for further discussion.
 reinsurance fee                               reinsurance fee: this fee is a fixed dollar per customer levy that applies to insurers and self-insured major medical plans excluding medicare advantage and medicare part d products. proceeds from the fee will be used to fund the reinsurance program for non-grandfathered individual business sold either on or off the public exchanges beginning in
2014. for our insured business, the amount of the fee is approximately $110 million in 2014 and is tax deductible. we incorporated the 2014 fees into our targeted pricing actions. see the global health care section of this md&amp;a for further discussion.
public health exchanges                         public health exchanges: for 2014, we offered individual coverage on five public health insurance exchanges (arizona, colorado, florida, tennessee and texas). beginning in 2015, in addition to those five states, we began offering coverage on exchanges in maryland, georgia and missouri. see the global health care segment section of this md&amp;a for further discussion around the results from our individual business.
risk mitigation programs                        risk mitigation programs: see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of these programs that commenced on january 1, 2014 along with our accounting policy. we recorded receivables of approximately $200 million after-tax in 2014 related to these programs.
commercial mlr                                  commercial mlr: the effect of the commercial mlr rebate accrual was not material to our results of operations or cash flows in 2014.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations: 2014 compared to 2013 and 2013 compared to 2012

revenues: the components of revenue changes are discussed further below:   
premiums. the increase in 2014 compared with 2013 reflects premium growth in each of our ongoing reporting segments: global health care, global supplemental benefits and group disability and life. these results are primarily attributable to rate increases to recover both medical cost trend and new taxes and fees assessed under health care reform. business growth in certain of our market segments and products, including u.s. commercial individual, stop loss and medicaid also contributed to the increase. the increase in 2013 compared with 2012 was driven primarily by continued customer growth in targeted markets of all of the ongoing segments, and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions in late 2012 in the global supplemental benefits segment.

fees and other revenues. the increase in 2014 compared with 2013 largely resulted from growth in specialty contributions, including pharmacy and cost containment. for 2013, the growth in fees and other revenues over 2012 was due to customer growth as well as increased specialty contributions. fees and other revenues also included pre-tax losses of $39 million in 2013 and $119 million in 2012 attributable to the hedge program associated with the gmdb and gmib businesses prior to the reinsurance transaction with berkshire in 2013.

net investment income. in 2014, net investment income was flat compared with 2013, reflecting higher average investment assets offset by lower yields. the slight increase in 2013, compared with 2012, was primarily due to higher yields driven in part by higher partnership income, partially offset by lower average investment assets primarily due to sales of assets to fund the reinsurance transaction with berkshire.

mail order pharmacy revenues. increases in each of 2014 and 2013 compared with the prior year, primarily reflected higher prescription volume for specialty medications (injectibles) and price increases to recover pharmacy cost trend.

realized investment results. in 2014, realized investment results decreased compared with 2013, primarily due to significantly lower gains on sales of fixed maturities that were partially offset by a gain on the sale of an equity interest in 2014. the significant increase in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily resulted from gains on the sales of real estate joint ventures and higher gains on sales of fixed maturities. in the first quarter of 2013, we realized large gains on sales of fixed maturities primarily to fund the reinsurance transaction with berkshire. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

global health care medical claims expense. see the global health care section of this md&a for further discussion.

other benefit expenses. the decrease in other benefit expenses in 2014 compared with 2013 resulted from the absence of the charges recorded in the first quarter of 2013 associated with the reinsurance agreement with berkshire ($727 million pre-tax), partially offset by continued business growth in the global supplemental and group disability and life segments. in 2013, the increase compared with 2012 reflected the charges recorded in the first quarter of 2013 associated with the reinsurance agreement with berkshire and, to a lesser extent, continued business growth in the global supplemental and group disability and life segments.

mail order pharmacy costs. the increases in both 2014 and 2013 are due to volume increases for specialty medications (injectibles) and higher unit costs.

other operating expenses. in 2014, the increase in other operating expenses over 2013 was largely driven by new taxes and fees assessed under health care reform and business growth in all of our ongoing segments. the increase in 2013 compared with 2012 was due primarily to business growth in all of our ongoing segments. see the segment reporting section of this md&a for additional discussion of operating expenses.

shareholders' net income. for 2014, the significant increase in shareholders' net income compared with 2013 is largely due to the absence of the $507 million after-tax charge associated with the reinsurance agreement with berkshire recorded in the first quarter of 2013. the decrease in shareholders' net income in 2013, compared with 2012 was also driven by this after-tax charge, partially offset by an increase in adjusted income from operations.

adjusted income from operations. in 2014, the increase in adjusted income from operations compared with 2013 was largely driven by higher earnings in our ongoing business segments (global health care, global supplemental benefits, and group disability and life), partially offset by higher taxes in corporate related to health care reform and the absence of favorable tax benefits recorded in the third quarter of 2013. the increase in adjusted income from operations in 2013 compared with 2012 was largely attributable to earnings growth in all of our ongoing business segments (global health care, global supplemental benefits, and group disability and life). see the segment discussions later in this md&a for further information.

consolidated effective tax rate. the increase in the consolidated effective tax rate in 2014, compared with 2013, was primarily driven by the non-deductible health insurance industry tax first assessed under health care reform in 2014. the consolidated effective tax rate decreased in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily driven by favorable tax benefits reported in the third quarter of 2013. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

global medical customers (excluding limited benefits). we exited the limited benefits business in 2014 as required by health care reform. excluding limited benefits customers, our medical customer base increased in both 2014 and 2013 compared with comparable prior years, primarily driven by continued growth in our targeted market segments.

shareholders' equity              $10,774         $10,567          $9,769
consolidated short-term investments decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 as a result of the company reinvesting proceeds from maturities of short-term investments in longer-term holdings. the increase in short-term investments in 2013 compared with 2012 was driven by purchases of liquid commercial paper and united states government obligations.
liquidity we maintain liquidity at two levels: the subsidiary level and the parent company level.
liquidity requirements at the subsidiary level generally consist of:

claim and benefit payments to policyholders; and

operating expense requirements, primarily for employee compensation and benefits, information technology and real estate.
our subsidiaries normally meet their operating requirements by:

maintaining appropriate levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments;

using cash flows from operating activities;

selling investments;

matching investment durations to those estimated for the related insurance and contractholder liabilities; and

borrowing from the parent company.
liquidity requirements at the parent company level generally consist of:

debt service and dividend payments to shareholders; and

pension plan funding.
the parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by:

maintaining appropriate levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments;

collecting dividends from its subsidiaries;

using proceeds from issuance of debt (including commercial paper) and equity securities; and

borrowing from its subsidiaries.
cash flows for the years ended december 31, were as follows:
(in millions)                                             2014              2013            2012
net cash provided by operating activities                 $1,994            $719            $2,350
net cash provided by (used in) investing activities       $(1,755)          $15             $(3,857)
net cash used in financing activities                     $(1,582)          $(930)          $(228)
cash flows from operating activities consist of cash receipts and disbursements for premiums and fees, mail order pharmacy, other revenues, investment income, taxes, benefits and expenses, and, prior to february 4, 2013, gains and losses recognized in connection with our gmdb and gmib equity hedge programs. because certain income and expense transactions do not generate cash, and because cash transactions related to revenues and expenses may occur in periods different from when those revenues and expenses are recognized in shareholders' net income, cash flows from operating activities can be significantly different from shareholders' net income.
cash flows from investing activities generally consist of net investment purchases or sales and net purchases of property and equipment including capitalized software, as well as cash used to acquire businesses.
cash flows from financing activities are generally comprised of issuances and re-payment of debt at the parent company level, proceeds on the issuance of common stock resulting from stock option exercises, and stock repurchases. in addition, the subsidiaries report deposits to and withdrawals from investment contract liabilities (including universal life insurance liabilities) because such liabilities are considered financing activities with policyholders.
operating activities cash flows from operating activities increased substantially in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to the absence of the 2013 reinsurance payments totaling $2.2 billion to berkshire. excluding those payments and tax benefits realized in connection with the berkshire transaction, cash flows from operating activities in 2014 decreased by $0.6 billion, compared with 2013. this decrease was primarily related to the volume and timing of reimbursements prescribed by government programs.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cash provided by operating activities declined by $1.6 billion in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to reinsurance payments totaling $2.2 billion made in 2013 to berkshire.
investing activities cash flows from investing activities decreased by $1.8 billion in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to higher net purchases of fixed maturities. in 2013, net purchases of fixed maturities were lower than 2014 primarily due to funding the berkshire transaction. cash flows from investing activities increased by $3.9 billion in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily driven by the absence of 2012 payments to acquire healthspring.
financing activities cash used in financing activities increased in 2014 compared with the same period in 2013, primarily reflecting $0.6 billion in higher repurchases of common stock. cash used in financing activities in 2013 increased by $0.7 billion compared with 2012 primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock.
share repurchase we maintain a share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors. the decision to repurchase shares depends on market conditions and alternate uses of capital. we have repurchased, and may continue to repurchase, shares on the open market through a rule 10b5-1 plan that permits a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. we suspend activity under this program from time to time and also remove such suspensions, generally without public announcement.
in 2014, we repurchased 18.5 million shares for $1.6 billion. from january 1, 2015 through february 25, 2015 we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $217 million. on february 25, 2015, the company's board of directors increased share repurchase authority by $500 million. accordingly, the total remaining share repurchase authorization as of february 25, 2015 was $966 million. in 2013, the company repurchased 13.6 million shares for $1.0 billion and, in 2012, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $208 million.
interest expense interest expense on long-term debt, short-term debt and capital leases was as follows:

interest expense       $265          $270          $268
the weighted average interest rate for outstanding short-term debt (primarily commercial paper) was 0.27% at december 31, 2014 and 0.41% at december 31, 2013.
capital resources our capital resources (primarily retained earnings and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities) provide protection for policyholders, furnish the financial strength to underwrite insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth.
management, guided by regulatory requirements and rating agency capital guidelines, determines the amount of capital resources that we maintain. management allocates resources to new long-term business commitments when returns, considering the risks, look promising and when the resources available to support existing business are adequate.
we prioritize our use of capital resources to:

provide the capital necessary to support growth and maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries;

consider acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous; and

return capital to investors through share repurchase.
the availability of capital resources will be impacted by equity and credit market conditions. extreme volatility in credit or equity market conditions may reduce our ability to issue debt or equity securities.
liquidity and capital resources outlook at december 31, 2014, there was approximately $400 million in cash and short-term investments available at the parent company level. in 2015, the parent company's combined cash obligations are expected to be approximately $380 million to pay for commercial paper maturities, interest, dividends and required pension contributions.
we expect, based on the parent company's current cash position, current projections for subsidiary dividends, and the ability to refinance its commercial paper borrowing, to have sufficient liquidity to meet the obligations discussed above.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations agreement was available to us. within the maximum debt leverage covenant in the line of credit agreement, we have $6.5 billion of borrowing capacity in addition to the $5.2 billion of debt outstanding.
though we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity, continued significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could affect our ability to access those markets for additional borrowings or increase costs associated with borrowing funds.
we maintain a capital management strategy to retain overseas a significant portion of the earnings from our foreign operations. these undistributed earnings are deployed outside of the u.s. in support of the liquidity and capital needs of our foreign operations. as of december 31, 2014 undistributed earnings were approximately $1.8 billion. approximately $15 million of cash and cash equivalents held overseas would, if repatriated, be subject to a charge representing the difference between the u.s. and foreign tax rates. this strategy does not materially limit our ability to meet our liquidity and capital needs in the united states. cash and cash equivalents in foreign operations are held primarily to meet local liquidity and surplus needs with excess funds generally invested in longer duration, high quality securities.
unfunded pension plan liability.    as of december 31, 2014, our unfunded pension liability was $1.1 billion, reflecting an increase of approximately $0.5 billion from december 31, 2013. the year over year increase in the unfunded liability reflected $0.6 billion in higher projected benefit obligations primarily as a result of a decrease of 75 basis points in the assumed discount rate, and changes to our mortality assumptions based on an updated pension mortality table. these impacts were partially offset by $0.1 billion in asset growth driven by pension contributions and strong asset returns. in 2015, we do not expect to make pension contributions in excess of the $5 million minimum required under the pension protection act of 2006. see note 9 for additional information regarding our pension plans.
solvency ii.    our businesses in the european union will be subject to the directive on insurance regulation, solvency and governance requirements known as solvency ii. this directive will impose economic risk-based solvency and governance requirements and supervisory rules and becomes effective in 2016, although certain eu country regulators are requiring companies to demonstrate technical capability and comply with increased capital levels in advance of this effective date. our european insurance companies are capitalized at levels consistent with projected solvency ii requirements and in compliance with anticipated governance and technical capability requirements.
guarantees and contractual obligations we are contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business. the maturities of our primary contractual cash obligations, as of december 31, 2014, are estimated to be as follows:

insurance liabilities.  contractual cash obligations for insurance liabilities, excluding unearned premiums, represent estimated net benefit payments for health, life and disability insurance policies and annuity contracts. recorded contractholder deposit funds reflect current fund balances primarily from universal life customers. contractual cash obligations for these universal life contracts are estimated by projecting future payments using assumptions for lapse, withdrawal and mortality. these projected future payments include estimated future interest crediting on current fund balances based on current investment yields less the estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees. actual obligations in any single year will vary based on actual morbidity, mortality, lapse, withdrawal, investment and premium experience. the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and contractholder liabilities of $20 billion recorded on the balance sheet because the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for interest and the recorded

long-term debt includes scheduled interest payments. capital leases are included in long-term debt and represent obligations for it network storage, servers and equipment.

other long-term liabilities.  this table includes estimated payments for gmib contracts, pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations, supplemental and deferred compensation plans, interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts, and certain tax and reinsurance liabilities. these items are presented in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
estimated payments of $76 million for deferred compensation, non-qualified and international pension plans and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid in less than one year. our best estimate is that contributions to the qualified domestic pension plans during 2015 will be approximately $5 million. we expect to make payments subsequent to 2015 for these obligations, however subsequent payments have been excluded from the table as their timing is based on plan assumptions that may materially differ from actual activities. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
the above table also does not contain $26 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of their resolution with the respective taxing authorities. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2014 for further information.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:

it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and

changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below.
in addition to the estimates presented in the following table, there are other accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits, as well as estimates with respect to unpaid claims and claim expenses, postemployment and postretirement benefits other than pensions, certain compensation accruals, and income taxes.
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.

requires management judgment. the degree of judgment involved generally correlates to the level of pricing readily observable in the markets. financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets or with market observable inputs to determine fair value, such as public securities, generally require less judgment. conversely, private placements including more complex securities that are traded infrequently are typically measured using pricing models that require more judgment as to the inputs and assumptions used to estimate fair value. there may be a number of alternative inputs to select, based on an understanding of the issuer, the structure of the security and overall market conditions. in addition, these factors are inherently variable in nature as they change frequently in response to market conditions. approximately two-thirds of our fixed maturities are public securities, and one-third are private placement securities. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our fair value measurements and the procedures performed by management to determine that the amounts represent appropriate estimates.

excluding the special items reported in 2013, segment earnings and adjusted income from operations increased in 2014, compared with 2013. this growth was primarily driven by increased specialty contributions, including strong pharmacy results, partially offset by lower earnings in our government segment primarily due to taxes and fees mandated by health care reform and a higher medical care ratio in our medicare part d business. in addition, results include the impact of higher operating expenses reflecting investment spending to enhance our capabilities, and lower margins in our u.s. commercial group risk business, including our exit from the limited benefits business. results in the u.s. commercial individual business (after considering receivables from the government risk mitigation programs) were flat.
earnings discussion: 2013 compared to 2012
the increase in global health care's segment earnings and adjusted income from operations in 2013, compared with 2012, reflected revenue growth from a higher customer base and rate increases consistent with underlying medical cost trends. results in 2013 also benefited from increased specialty contributions and higher net investment income.
these favorable effects were partially offset by a higher mcr in medicare advantage in 2013 driven by lower per member government reimbursements and higher inpatient and outpatient medical costs. in 2013, results also included higher operating expenses associated with customer growth and enhancements to our capabilities, partially offset by operating cost efficiencies.

premiums. the increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily driven by rate increases on most products in the commercial segment to recover underlying medical cost trends and taxes and fees mandated by health care reform. in addition, premiums reflect customer growth in our u.s. commercial individual business, as well as in targeted markets for stop loss and medicaid products. these increases were partially offset by a decline in group commercial risk customers including a shift from our insured to self-insured products and our exit from the limited benefits business.
premiums increased in 2013, compared with 2012, in the u.s. commercial segment due to customer growth and rate increases consistent with underlying medical cost trends. in addition, medicare advantage premiums were higher due to timing of the healthspring acquisition and customer growth.
fees and other revenues. the increase in 2014, compared with 2013, largely resulted from growth in specialty contributions, including pharmacy and cost containment. in 2013, the growth in fees and other revenues compared to 2012 was due to customer growth as well as increased cost containment revenues.
net investment income. the increases in both 2014 and 2013, compared with each prior year, were due to higher assets and higher income from partnership investments, with the 2014 increase partially offset by lower yields.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations medical claims expense. the 5% increase in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily reflects medical cost inflation and customer growth, partially offset by our exit from the limited benefits business.
medical claims expense increased 12% in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to medical cost inflation, the timing of the healthspring acquisition, and customer growth. higher medicare advantage inpatient and outpatient medical costs also contributed to the increase.
the guaranteed cost medical care ratio increased slightly in 2014, compared with 2013, due to a higher medical care ratio in the u.s. individual business and the exit from the limited benefits business, offset by rate increases to cover new taxes and fees mandated by health care reform.
the medicare advantage medical care ratio decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, reflecting improved per-customer revenues. the ratio increased in 2013, compared with 2012, driven by lower government reimbursement rates as well as higher medical costs.
the medicare part d medical care ratio increased in 2014, compared with 2013, primarily due to higher pharmacy costs including some impact from the mix and channel of customer drug purchases as well as increased specialty medication costs.
operating expenses. operating expenses increased 8% in 2014 compared with 2013. excluding the 2013 special items and the health care reform taxes and fees that became effective in 2014, operating expenses increased 3% in 2014 compared with 2013. the increase primarily reflects higher volume-related expenses and greater spending to enhance our capabilities, partially offset by cost efficiencies.
operating expenses increased 5% in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily reflecting customer growth, increased spending to enhance our capabilities, including costs associated with our new pbm arrangement, and the timing of the healthspring acquisition, partially offset by cost efficiencies.
the operating expense ratios, both including and excluding special items, are essentially flat in 2014, compared with 2013. excluding the health care reform taxes and fees that became effective in 2014, the operating expense ratios decreased in 2014 compared with 2013, reflecting cost efficiencies and higher revenue, partially offset by higher spending to enhance our capabilities.
the operating expense ratios including and excluding special items decreased in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily driven by revenue growth and cost efficiencies partially offset by higher spending to enhance our capabilities, including 2013 costs associated with our new pbm arrangement.
effective tax rates. the increase in the segment's effective tax rate in 2014 compared with 2013 was attributable to the 2014 health insurance industry tax that is not tax deductible. the slight decline in the effective tax rate in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily reflected the recognition of tax benefits in certain of the segment's foreign operations.
other items affecting health care results global health care medical claims payable medical claims payable increased 6% in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily driven by growth in the individual and stop loss books of business. medical claims payable increased 10% in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily reflecting growth in the stop loss and healthspring books of business.

2013 and 2012 exclude limited benefits customers.
as required by health care reform, we exited the limited benefits business effective december 31, 2013. excluding this impact, our medical customer base increased 3% in 2014, primarily driven by continued growth in the middle market, select, individual, and government market segments, partially offset by a decline in the national market segment.
excluding limited benefits customers, medical customers increased 2% in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily reflecting continued aso customer growth due to strong retention and sales in targeted market segments.
global supplemental benefits segment segment description the key factors affecting segment earnings and adjusted income from operations for this segment are:

premium growth, including new business and customer retention;

benefits expense as a percentage of earned premium (loss ratio);

operating expense and acquisition expense as a percentage of segment revenues (expense ratio and acquisition cost ratio);

the impact of movements in foreign currency; and

the effective tax rate.
throughout this discussion, prior period currency adjusted income from operations, revenues, and benefits and expenses are being calculated by applying the current period's exchange rates to reported results in the prior period. a strengthening u.s. dollar against foreign currencies will decrease segment earnings, while a weakening u.s. dollar produces the opposite effect.
as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the global supplemental benefits segment acquired two businesses during the second half of 2012: great american supplemental benefits and finans emeklilik (also referred to as the "turkey jv"). collectively, throughout this discussion these two transactions are referred to as "the acquisitions."

the increase in segment earnings and adjusted income from operations was driven in part by a lower acquisition cost ratio and continuing business growth, primarily in south korea, partially offset by a higher loss ratio driven by a business mix shift and higher incurred claims. 2014 results also included favorable tax-related items of $21 million recorded in the third quarter of 2014 (see effective tax rate discussion below).
earnings discussion: 2013 compared to 2012
the increase in segment earnings and adjusted income from operations was primarily driven by business growth, primarily in south korea, lower acquisition costs in europe reflecting a decision to cease selling activities in certain markets, and earnings of the acquisitions during the second half of 2013, partially offset by higher acquisition and benefits expenses.
revenues premiums increased in both 2014 and 2013 compared with each prior year. when applying 2014 exchange rates to 2013 and 2012 results, premiums increased by 13% in 2014 and 25% in 2013. these increases were primarily attributable to new sales, particularly in south korea and the u.s. reflecting both customer growth and sales of higher premium products. in 2013, the increase was also due to the impact of the acquisitions in the second half of 2012.
net investment income. in 2014, net investment income increased compared with 2013, primarily due to asset growth in south korea. net investment income increased in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions in the second half of 2012.
benefits and expenses benefit expenses increased in both 2014 and 2013, compared with each prior year. applying actual 2014 currency exchange rates to 2013 results, benefit expenses increased by 16%. these increases were primarily due to business growth and higher claims primarily in south korea and the u.s. applying actual 2014 currency exchange rates to prior year results, benefit expenses increased 28% in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily due to the acquisitions in the second half of 2012 and business growth.
loss ratios increased in 2014 and 2013 compared with each prior year. in 2014, the increase is due primarily to a business mix shift toward products with higher loss ratios and higher incurred claims. for 2013, the increase primarily results from the inherently higher loss ratios of the acquisitions in the second half of 2012.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating expenses. included in operating expenses for the global supplemental benefits segment are both policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses. overall operating expenses were higher in 2014 and 2013 compared with each prior year, reflecting increases in both policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses. for 2014, the increase in policy acquisition costs reflects higher commissions in hong kong, the u.k. and the u.s., primarily driven by higher sales. for 2013, the increase in policy acquisition costs was largely attributable to the acquisitions and business growth, partially offset by lower acquisition costs in europe reflecting a decision to cease selling activities in certain markets during 2012. the increases in other operating expenses in both 2014 and 2013 compared with each prior year were largely driven by strategic business investments.
acquisition cost ratios decreased in both 2014 and 2013 compared with each prior year. for 2014, the decline in the ratio largely represents a shift toward higher premium products and more disciplined acquisition cost spending. the decrease in the ratio in 2013 was primarily driven by lower acquisition costs in europe reflecting a decision to cease selling activities in certain markets during 2012 and, to a lesser extent, the impact of the lower acquisition cost ratios associated with our supplemental benefits business in the u.s.
the expense ratio (excluding acquisition costs) was flat in 2014 compared with 2013 reflecting strategic business investments largely offset by operating efficiencies. in 2013, the expense ratio decreased compared with 2012 primarily due to the lower expense ratios associated with our supplemental benefits business in the u.s., partially offset by strategic business investments.
effective tax rates. the effective tax rate for the global supplemental benefits segment decreased in 2014 compared with 2013, due to favorable tax related items reported in the third quarter of 2014, primarily the favorable effect of expanding our capital management strategy to retain a significant portion of our foreign operations' earnings overseas. effective tax rates in 2013 and 2012 largely reflect the continuing favorable impact of this capital management strategy.
other items affecting global supplemental benefits results for our global supplemental benefits segment, south korea is the single largest geographic market. south korea generated 52% of the segment's revenues and 76% of the segment's earnings in 2014. due to the concentration of business in south korea, the global supplemental benefits segment is exposed to potential losses resulting from economic, regulatory and geopolitical developments in that country, as well as foreign currency movements affecting the south korean won, that could have a significant impact on the segment's results and our consolidated financial results. in south korea and certain other geographic markets, we continue to innovate and broaden our product and channel distribution capabilities to support business growth and mitigate potential adverse effects of increased data privacy regulatory requirements and other risks to telemarketing distribution. in 2014, our global supplemental benefits segment operations in south korea represented 4% of our total consolidated revenues and 8% of shareholders' net income.
group disability and life segment key factors for this segment are:

premium growth, including new business and customer retention;

net investment income;

benefit expenses as a percentage of earned premium (loss ratio); and

other operating expense as a percentage of earned premiums and fees (expense ratio).

segment earnings increased in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to the absence of the $51 million after-tax charge related to a disability claims regulatory matter. see the overview section of this md&a for further information. the increase in adjusted income from operations reflected favorable life results, higher net investment income and a lower expense ratio partially offset by higher disability claim costs largely due to a lower discount rate. disability claim costs were lower in 2013 in part due to the $29 million favorable after-tax effect of a higher discount rate on claims incurred in 2013, resulting from the reallocation of higher yielding assets to the disability and life portfolio that had previously supported liabilities in the run-off reinsurance business. the favorable after-tax effects of reserve reviews were $52 million in 2014 and $60 million in 2013.
earnings discussion: 2013 compared to 2012
segment earnings decreased in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to the charge associated with the disability claims regulatory matter. adjusted income from operations increased reflecting lower disability claim costs, a lower expense ratio and higher net investment income partially offset by unfavorable life claims experience. lower disability claim costs included the $29 million favorable after-tax effect of a higher discount rate on claims incurred during 2013 as discussed above. results included the favorable after-tax effect of reserve reviews of $60 million in 2013 and $43 million in 2012.
revenues premiums.    the increases in both 2014 and in 2013 reflected new business growth due to disability and life sales and continued strong customer retention.
net investment income.    the increases in both 2014 and in 2013 were primarily due to higher assets partially offset by lower yields.
benefits and expenses benefit expenses.    the increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was due primarily to premium growth and higher disability claims costs including the effect of a lower discount rate, partially offset by the absence of the $77 million before-tax charge for the disability claims regulatory matter and favorable life results. disability claim costs in 2013 benefited from the $40 million before-tax impact of higher discount rates driven by the reallocation of higher yielding assets to the disability and life portfolio as noted above. the favorable life results reflected lower new claim incidence. benefit expenses included the before-tax favorable impact of reserve reviews of $75 million in 2014 compared with $84 million in 2013.
the increase in benefit expenses in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to the $77 million before-tax impact of the disability claims regulatory matter, premium growth and unfavorable life claims experience partially offset by lower disability claim costs. the unfavorable life claims experience was driven by higher new claim sizes and the lower disability claim costs were driven by discount rate changes in 2013 as discussed above and the favorable impact of reserve reviews. benefit expenses in 2013 included the before-tax favorable impact of reserve reviews of $84 million compared with $60 million in 2012.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating expense ratio.    the decrease in the operating expense ratio in both 2014 and 2013 reflected continued expense discipline.
effective tax rate.    the segment's effective tax rate is generally lower than the federal tax rate of 35%, primarily due to tax-exempt interest income on bonds. the increase in the effective tax rate in 2014 compared with 2013 resulted from a decline in the proportion of the segment's income that was attributable to tax-exempt interest and, to a lesser extent, the absence of the tax benefit reported in 2013 related to the completion of irs tax audits. the decline in the effective tax rate in 2013 compared with 2012 was due to the tax benefit reported in 2013 related to the completion of irs tax audits.
other operations description cigna's coli business contributes the majority of earnings in other operations. in the first quarter of 2014, we combined the results of the run-off reinsurance segment with other immaterial segments in other operations, because the results are expected to be immaterial subsequent to the reinsurance transaction with berkshire in 2013. cigna's other operations segment also includes the results from the run-off settlement annuity business, as well as the remaining deferred gains recognized from the sale of the individual life insurance and annuity and retirement benefits businesses. prior year information has been conformed to the current year presentation.

segment earnings increased significantly in 2014 compared with 2013, due primarily to the absence of the 2013 charge related to the reinsurance transaction with berkshire. adjusted income from operations decreased in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily reflecting the absence of the $14 million favorable impact of the 2009-2010 irs examinations completed during the third quarter of 2013 and higher coli claims experience in 2014.
earnings discussion: 2013 compared to 2012
the decrease in segment results in 2013 compared with 2012 was driven largely by the 2013 charge related to the reinsurance transaction with berkshire. the increase in adjusted income from operations in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily resulted from the absence of the 2012 reserve strengthening in the gmdb business of $27 million and the $14 million favorable impact of completing the 2009-2010 irs examinations during the third quarter of 2013. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the irs examinations.
revenues premiums reflect revenue primarily on universal and whole life insurance policies in the coli business. premiums increased in 2014 compared with 2013 driven primarily by strong persistency as well as the impact of higher mortality in 2014 on experience-rated business. in 2013, premiums decreased compared with 2012, due to the absence of vadbe premium in 2013 because of the reinsurance transaction, partially offset by higher coli premium.
fees and other revenues included losses of $39 million in 2013 and $119 million in 2012 associated with a dynamic hedge program for the run-off reinsurance business that was discontinued in 2013 with

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the effective exit from the gmdb and gmib businesses. excluding this hedge activity, other revenues were slightly lower in both 2014 and 2013 compared with each prior year, primarily due to the continued decline in deferred gain amortization related to the sold retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses.
net investment income decreased in 2014 and, to a much more significant degree, in 2013 compared with each prior year. these decreases were primarily due to lower average yields and the selling or reallocating of investment assets in 2013 as a result of the reinsurance transaction with berkshire.
benefits and expenses benefit expenses decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the absence of the $727 million charge resulting from the berkshire transaction as well as gmdb activity prior to the transaction, partially offset by higher claims experience in the coli business. excluding the $727 million charge resulting from the berkshire transaction, benefit expenses decreased in 2013 compared with 2012 largely due to the gmdb activity prior to the berkshire transaction, that was favorable in early 2013 and unfavorable in 2012.
operating expenses decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the absence of expenses associated with the berkshire transaction and lower ongoing expenses subsequent to the transaction. operating expenses in 2012 included gmib fair value gains of $(41) million. excluding this gmib activity, operating expenses increased in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to expenses associated with the berkshire transaction.

corporate's segment loss and adjusted loss from operations increased in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to an increase in taxes related to certain employee stock compensation costs that are not deductible for income tax purposes under health care reform.
the decrease in corporate's segment loss in 2013 compared with 2012 is primarily attributable to the absence of special item costs associated with both litigation matters and the healthspring acquisition in 2012.

the fixed maturity portfolio increased approximately $2.5 billion during 2014, reflecting increased investment in fixed maturities and the impact of decreased market yields on asset valuations. although overall asset values are well in excess of amortized cost, there are specific securities with amortized cost in excess of fair value by $42 million in aggregate as of december 31, 2014. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
as of december 31, 2014, $17.1 billion, or 90%, of the fixed maturities in our investment portfolio were investment grade (baa and above, or equivalent), and the remaining $1.9 billion were below investment grade. the majority of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non-investment grade spectrum. these quality characteristics have not materially changed during the year.
our investment in state and local government securities, with an average quality rating of aa2 is diversified by issuer and geography with no single exposure greater than $28 million. we assess each issuer's credit quality based on a fundamental analysis of underlying financial information and do not rely solely on statistical rating organizations or monoline insurer guarantees.
we invest in high quality foreign government obligations, with an average quality rating of aa3 as of december 31, 2014. these investments are primarily concentrated in asia consistent with the geographic distribution of our international business operations. foreign government obligations also include $218 million of investments in european sovereign debt, none of which are in countries with significant political or economic concerns (portugal, italy, ireland, greece, and spain).
corporate fixed maturities include private placement investments of $5.2 billion that are generally less marketable than publicly-traded bonds. however, yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publicly-traded bonds with comparable credit risk. we perform a credit analysis of each issuer, diversify investments by industry and issuer and require financial and other covenants that allow us to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength and pursue remedial actions, if warranted. corporate fixed maturities include $343 million of investments in companies that are domiciled or have significant business interests in italy, ireland, and spain. these investments have an average quality rating of baa2 and are diversified by industry sector, including approximately 2% invested in financial institutions. corporate fixed maturities also include investments in the energy and natural gas sector of $1.4 billion that have an average quality rating of baa and are diversified by issuer with no single exposure greater than $45 million.
commercial mortgage loans our commercial mortgage loans are fixed rate loans, diversified by property type, location and borrower. loans are secured by high quality commercial properties and are generally made at less than 75% of the property's value at origination of the loan. property value, debt service coverage, quality, building tenancy and stability of cash flows are all important financial underwriting considerations. we hold no direct residential mortgage loans and do not securitize or service mortgage loans.
we completed an annual in-depth review of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio during the second quarter of 2014. this review included an analysis of each property's year-end 2013 financial statements, rent rolls, operating plans and budgets for 2014, a physical inspection of the property and other pertinent factors. based on property values and cash flows estimated as part of this review and subsequent fundings and repayments, the portfolio's average loan-to-value ratio improved to 63% at december 31, 2014, from 64% as of december 31, 2013, reflecting a modest increase in values for high quality commercial real estate. the portfolio's average debt service coverage ratio also improved, increasing to 1.66 at december 31, 2014 from 1.62 as of december 31, 2013. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
commercial real estate capital markets remain most active for well leased, quality commercial real estate located in strong institutional investment markets. the vast majority of properties securing the mortgages in our mortgage portfolio possess these characteristics. while commercial real estate fundamentals continued to improve, the improvement has varied across geographies and property types.
the commercial mortgage loan portfolio contains approximately 80 loans, including five impaired loans with a carrying value totaling $166 million that are classified as problem or potential problem loans. two of these loans totaling $86 million, net of $4 million in reserves, are current based on restructured terms and three loans totaling

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
$80 million, net of $8 million in reserves, are current. all of the remaining loans continue to perform under their contractual terms. we have $247 million of loans maturing in the next twelve months. given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate, positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash investment averaging 30%, we remain confident that the vast majority of borrowers will continue to perform as expected under the contract terms.
other long-term investments other long-term investments of $1.5 billion primarily include investments in security partnership and real estate funds as well as direct investments in real estate joint ventures. the funds typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privately held companies (securities partnerships) and equity real estate. given our subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities, we assume a higher level of risk for higher expected returns. to mitigate risk, investments are diversified across approximately 110 separate partnerships, and approximately 65 general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships. also, the funds' underlying investments are diversified by industry sector or property type, and geographic region. no single partnership investment exceeds 6% of our securities and real estate partnership portfolio.
although the total fair values of investments exceeded their carrying values as of december 31, 2014, the fair value of our ownership interest in certain funds that are carried at cost was less than carrying value by $17 million. we expect to recover our carrying value over the average remaining life of these investments of approximately 5 years. given the current economic environment, future impairments are possible; however, management does not expect those losses to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding other long-term investments.
problem and potential problem investments
"problem" bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by 60 days or more or have been restructured as to terms, including concessions by us for modification of interest rate, principal payment or maturity date. "potential problem" bonds and commercial mortgage loans are considered current (no payment more than 59 days past due), but management believes they have certain characteristics that increase the likelihood that they may become problems. the characteristics management considers include, but are not limited to, the following:

request from the borrower for restructuring;

principal or interest payments past due by more than 30 but fewer than 60 days;

downgrade in credit rating;

collateral losses on asset-backed securities; and

for commercial mortgages, deterioration of debt service coverage below 1.0 or value declines resulting in estimated loan-to-value ratios increasing to 100% or more.
we recognize interest income on problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans only when payment is actually received because of the risk profile of the underlying investment. the amount that would have been reflected in net income if interest on non-accrual investments had been recognized in accordance with the original terms was not significant for 2014 or 2013.

other long-term investments included $7 million at december 31, 2013 of restructured loans that were previously reported in commercial mortgage loans.
net problem and potential problem investments representing approximately 1% of total investments, excluding policy loans at december 31, 2014, increased by approximately $30 million from december 31, 2013, primarily due to the addition of one commercial mortgage loan to problem investments.
included in realized investment gains (losses) were increases in valuation reserves related to commercial mortgage loans and other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturities and partnership investments of $52 million. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
investment outlook although financial markets in the united states continued to stabilize during 2014, they have more recently been impacted by continuing global uncertainty. fixed income asset values have appreciated broadly since the beginning of the year, however the changes in valuation have varied amongst investment sectors depending on perceived risk in the global markets. future realized and unrealized investment results will be driven largely by market conditions that exist when a transaction occurs or at the reporting date. these future conditions are not reasonably predictable. we believe that the vast majority of our fixed maturity investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms and that the commercial mortgage loan portfolio is positioned to perform well due to its solid aggregate loan-to-value ratio and strong debt service coverage. based on our strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities, we expect to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term. although future impairment losses resulting from credit deterioration and interest rate movements remain possible, we do not expect these losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk financial instruments our assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices. our primary market risk exposures are:

interest-rate risk on fixed-rate, medium-term instruments. changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return and our employee pension liabilities.

foreign currency exchange rate risk of the u.s. dollar primarily to the south korean won, euro, british pound, chinese yuan renminbi and taiwan dollar. an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.
our management of market risks we predominantly rely on three techniques to manage our exposure to market risk:

investment/liability matching.  we generally select investment assets with characteristics (such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity) that correspond to the underlying characteristics of our related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that we can match the investments to our obligations. shorter-term investments support generally shorter-term life and health liabilities. medium-term, fixed-rate investments support interest-sensitive and health liabilities. longer-term investments generally support products with longer pay out periods such as annuities and long-term disability liabilities.

use of local currencies for foreign operations.  we generally conduct our international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies. while this technique does not reduce foreign currency exposure on our net assets, it substantially limits exchange rate risk to those net assets.

use of derivatives.  we generally use derivative financial instruments to minimize certain market risks. in 2014, we entered into interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of our interest rate exposure on long-term debt from fixed rates to variable rates to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on our cash equivalent and short-term investment balances.
see notes 2(c) and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments.
effect of market fluctuations the examples that follow illustrate the adverse effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments including:

a hypothetical increase in market interest rates, primarily for fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by liabilities for long-term, fixed-rate debt; and

a hypothetical strengthening of the u.s. dollar to foreign currencies, primarily for the net assets of foreign subsidiaries denominated in a foreign currency.
management believes that actual results could differ materially from these examples because:

these examples were developed using estimates and assumptions;

changes in the fair values of all insurance-related assets and liabilities have been excluded because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk;

changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans (and related assets) have been excluded, consistent with the disclosure guidance; and

changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill, deferred policy acquisition costs, taxes, and various accrued liabilities have been excluded; because they are not financial instruments, their primary risks are other than market risk.
the effects of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of certain of our financial instruments, subject to the exclusions noted above (particularly insurance liabilities), would have been as follows as of december 31:

100 basis point increase in interest rates                   $850          $585
10% strengthening in u.s. dollar to foreign currencies       $320          $285
the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models, primarily duration modeling. the impact of a hypothetical increase to interest rates at december 31, 2014 was greater than that at december 31, 2013 reflecting increased asset purchases as well as valuation increases resulting from lower market yields of fixed maturities during 2014.
the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the foreign currencies held by us was estimated to be 10% of the u.s. dollar equivalent fair value. our foreign operations hold investment assets, such as fixed maturities, cash, and cash equivalents, that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities. due to the increase in 2014 of the amount of these investments that are primarily denominated in the south korean won, the effect of a hypothetical 10% strengthening in the u.s. dollar to foreign currencies at december 31, 2014 was greater than that effect at december 31, 2013.

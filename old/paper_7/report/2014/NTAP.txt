executive overview our company we are a leading global provider of innovative storage and data management software, systems and services. our storage solutions help customers create the flexible, efficient and highly available information technology (it) infrastructures they need to support their organizations.
our unified scale-out fabric-attached storage (fas) platform is designed to meet the demanding requirements of shared infrastructures and cloud environments. our e-series high-performance storage area network platform is designed to meet demanding performance and capacity requirements of dedicated workloads, while retaining simplicity and an optimized price to performance ratio. our fas storage platform uses the netapp® dataontap® storage operating system to deliver integrated data protection, comprehensive data management, and built-in efficiency software for virtualized, shared infrastructures, cloud computing, and mixed workload business applications. we offer hybrid and all-flash configurations of both fas and e-series platforms. effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we have changed the way we group our fas product platforms. we now describe our configured systems as (1) entry level products, which consists of our fas2000 systems, (2) mid-range products, which consists of our legacy fas3000 systems and our new fas8020 and fas8040 systems, and (3) high-end products, which consists of our legacy 6000 systems and our new fas8060 systems. this change had no impact on previously reported amounts.
in addition to our products, we provide a variety of services including hardware maintenance, and software entitlement and maintenance (sem), professional services, global support solutions, and customer education and training to help customers most effectively manage their data.
we employ a multichannel distribution strategy, selling products and services to end users and service providers through a direct sales force and through channel partners, including value-added resellers, system integrators, oems and distributors.
financial results and key performance metrics overview the following table provides an overview of some of our key financial metrics for each of the last three fiscal years (in millions, except per share amounts, percentages and days sales outstanding):

                      net revenues: our net revenues decreased slightly in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. this was primarily due to a decrease in oem product revenues of 26%, partially offset by increases in hardware maintenance contract revenue generated from a higher installed base of our hardware products under maintenance contracts.

                                                   gross profit margin percentage: our gross profit margin as a percentage of net revenues increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
primarily due to lower unit materials costs due to supply chain efficiencies and changes in our revenue mix. additionally, gross profit was favorably impacted by lower oem revenues and higher gross profit margins on add-on storage.

   income from operations as a percentage of net revenues: our income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased in fiscal 2014
compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in gross margins and the favorable impact of cost containment initiatives.

                                                         net income and diluted income per share: the 26% and 34% increases in net income and diluted income per share, respectively, in fiscal 2014
compared to fiscal 2013 reflects higher operating income in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by a 3% increase in our effective tax rate. in addition to these factors, diluted income per share was favorably impacted by a
5% decrease in the number of dilutive shares, primarily due to higher share repurchases in fiscal 2014.

   operating cash flows: operating cash flows decreased 3% in fiscal 2014, reflecting an increase in net income that was more than offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities.

   deferred revenue: total deferred revenue increased $90.7 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in deferred sem and service revenue related to service contract sales and renewals.

                    dso: dso increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 primarily due to a higher percentage of the fourth quarters shipments that occurred in the last month of the fourth quarter (shipment linearity) of fiscal 2014 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.

stock repurchase program and dividend activity during fiscal 2014, we repurchased 47.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $39.78 per share, for an aggregate of $1.9 billion. we also declared cash dividends of $0.60 per share of common stock in fiscal 2014, for which we paid an aggregate of $202.3 million.
restructuring plans in march 2014 and may 2013, we initiated business realignment plans designed to focus our resources on key strategic initiatives and streamline our business in light of the constrained it spending environment, resulting in a reduction of our global workforce of approximately 11% in aggregate, for which we have recognized an aggregate of $88.3 million of employee severance costs in fiscal 2014. we have completed all activities under the may 2013 plan, and expect to complete activities under the march 2014 plan in the first six months of fiscal 2015, with no significant additional charges.
recent activity on june 5, 2014 we issued $500.0 million principal amount of 3.375% senior notes due on june 15, 2021. we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including possible stock

repurchases, dividends, capital expenditures, working capital and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. for further information on the terms of this debt issuance, see note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america (gaap), which require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. we believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.
the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. the accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition, reserves and allowances we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. revenue from the sale of hardware systems and software components essential to the functionality of the hardware systems is recognized in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. our product revenues also include revenues from the sale of non-essential software products, which generally includes a perpetual license to our software. non-essential software sales are subject to industry specific software revenue recognition accounting guidance. sem and premium hardware maintenance services are recognized ratably over their contractual terms, generally from one to five years.
for multiple element arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the non-software deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement. for our non-software deliverables, we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price (esp). for our software entitlements and support services, we generally use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (vsoe). when we are unable to establish vsoe for our software entitlements and support services, we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration.
the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: vsoe if available, third party evidence (tpe) if vsoe is not available, or estimated selling price (esp) if neither vsoe nor tpe are available. generally, we are not able to determine tpe because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained.
we record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment. we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts.

the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for recognizing revenue:

distribution channels. our revenue estimates and assumptions are based on our ability to maintain consistent esp.
sales returns are estimated based on historical sales returns, current trends and our expectations regarding future experience.                                                                                                                            if there is insufficient relevant historical data for determining our sales returns estimates, or if we experience changes in practices related to sales returns or changes in additionally, distributors and partners participate in various marketing and other programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs based on contractual terms and historical experience.                                    market or competitive conditions resulting in higher than expected return rates, or if actual credits received by our distributors and partners deviate significantly from our estimates, our revenues may be adversely impacted.
our allowance for bad debt is based on an analysis of accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentration, customer solvency, current economic and geographic                                                                             our reserves for bad debt have generally been sufficient to cover credit losses. however, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an trends, and changes in customer payment terms and practices.                                                                                                                                                                                               impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

inventory valuation and purchase order accruals inventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value. the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories:
key estimates and assumptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                             key uncertainties we periodically perform an excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory. inventories are written down based on excess and obsolete reserves determined primarily on assumptions                                                                          although we use our best estimates to forecast future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or obsolescence related to technological developments, new about future demand forecasts and market conditions. at the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in   product introductions, customer requirements, competition or other factors could have a significant impact on the valuation of our inventory. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs and other that newly established cost basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        charges against earnings that adversely impact gross margins may be required. if actual market conditions are more favorable, we may realize higher gross profits in the period when the written-down inventory is sold.
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the manufacture of our products. if there are changes to the current regulations, we may be required to make product design changes which may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could adversely impact our operating results.
we make commitments to our third-party contract manufacturers and other suppliers to manage lead times and meet product forecasts and to other parties to purchase various key                                                                            if the actual materials demand is significantly lower than our forecast, we may be required to increase our recorded liabilities for estimated losses on non-cancelable purchase components used in the manufacture of our products. we establish accruals for estimated losses on non-cancelable purchase commitments when we believe it is probable that the components will not be utilized in future operations.                       commitments which would adversely impact our operating results.
goodwill and purchased intangible assets we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values based on established valuation techniques. goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
the carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets. this review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives, resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of operations.
40
we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we performed a quantitative test at the reporting unit level and determined the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for each reporting unit and, therefore, found no impairment of goodwill.
the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets:
key estimates and assumptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     key uncertainties the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an                                                                                                                                                                            while we employ experts to determine the acquisition date fair value of acquired intangibles, the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on significant orderly transaction in accordance with the accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets. the valuation of purchased intangible assets is principally based on estimates of the future performance and cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets from the acquired   management assumptions and estimates, which are inherently uncertain and highly subjective and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. if different assumptions were to be used, it could materially impact the purchase price business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         allocation.
evaluations of possible goodwill and purchased intangible assets impairment require us to make judgments and assumptions related to the allocation of our balance sheet and income                                                                                                                                in response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise statement amounts and estimate future cash flows and fair market values of our reporting units and assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                        exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or purchased intangible assets.
assumptions and estimates about future values of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as the adverse impact of unanticipated changes in macroeconomic conditions and technological changes or new product introductions from competitors. they can also be affected by internal factors such as changes in business strategy or in forecasted product life cycles and roadmaps. our ongoing consideration of these and other factors could result in future impairment charges or accelerated amortization expense, which could adversely affect our operating results.
product warranties estimated future hardware and software warranty costs are recorded as a cost of product revenues when the related revenue is recognized. we assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual each quarter and adjust the amount as considered necessary.

stock-based compensation we recognize stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our stock-based compensation:

stock-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to meet service vesting conditions and is impacted by the estimated forfeiture rate.                                                       if we experience employee turnover different from our historical rates, our stock-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.
valuation of investment securities our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, unless they are determined to be other-than-temporary impairments. the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold. our investment portfolio includes auction rate securities (arss), which we classify as long-term investments as there is no active market and we believe our ability to liquidate these investments in the next twelve months is uncertain.

in estimating the fair value of our arss we consider the assessments of the underlying structure of each security, discounted expected cash flows, credit ratings, workout periods, trading activity for similar securities in the secondary market and overall capital market liquidity.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. we compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.

changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, and uncertainties as to future renewals of favorable tax agreements and rulings.
deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested and there is no plan in   we consider the following matters, among others, in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment: the forecasts, budgets and financial requirements of the parent and the foreseeable future to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon.                                                                             subsidiaries for both the long and short term; the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest; and any u.s. and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances. if factors change, future income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
the determination of whether we should record or adjust a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is based on assumptions regarding our future profitability.             our future profits could change resulting in a change to our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized. we could adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.
the estimates for our uncertain tax positions are based primarily on company specific circumstances, applicable tax laws, tax opinions from outside firms and past results from       significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome examinations of our income tax returns.                                                                                                                                               or tax court rulings of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals.

discussion and analysis of results of operations overview  net revenues for fiscal 2014 were $6,325.1 million, down $7.3 million, or less than 1%, compared to fiscal 2013, reflecting a decrease in product revenues, mostly offset by increases in hardware maintenance contract and sem revenues.
net revenues for fiscal 2013 were $6,332.4 million, up $99.2 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2012. the increase was due to increases in hardware maintenance contract and sem revenues.
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased 2.6% during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to lower unit materials costs due to supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by a lower average selling price (asp) for total configured systems. additionally, gross profit was favorably impacted by lower oem revenues and higher margins on service revenues.
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased less than 1% during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.
sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 totaled $3,096.5 million, down 1% as a percentage of net revenues compared to fiscal 2013, reflecting cost control programs implemented in fiscal 2014, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation due to higher achievement against plan.
45
sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2013 totaled $3,151.6 million, up 7% compared to fiscal 2012. the increase was primarily due to increased compensation costs resulting from a 9% increase in average headcount during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.

the slight decrease in net revenues for fiscal 2014 was due to a decrease of $148.4 million in product revenues, offset by an aggregate increase in service and sem revenues of $141.1 million. product revenues comprised 62% of net revenues for fiscal 2014, compared to 65% of net revenues for fiscal 2013.
the increase in net revenues for fiscal 2013 was due to increases in service and sem revenues of $216.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in product revenues of $117.4 million. product revenues comprised 65% of net revenues for fiscal 2013, compared to 68% of net revenues for fiscal 2012.
sales through our indirect channels represented 82%, 81% and 78% of net revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. included in indirect channel sales were $584.7 million, $787.2 million and $889.5 million of oem revenues for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

product revenues consist of configured systems, which include bundled hardware and software products, and non-configured products, which consist primarily of add-on storage, oem products and add-on hardware and software products. please refer to the executive overview- our company section for a description of how, effective the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we aggregate our fas product platforms into entry-level, mid-range and high-end systems for reporting purposes.
total configured system revenues of $2,287.3 million increased by $4.2 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. revenues from fas high-end systems and e-series (which includes our all flash ef systems) increased, offset by decreases in fas entry level and mid-range systems. total configured systems unit volume increased 1.6% during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, primarily as a result of unit increases in the fas high-end and mid-range systems and e-series systems, partially offset by a decrease in unit volume of the fas entry level systems, reflecting a shift in customer demand to our newer mid-range and high-end products, lower sales to the u.s. public sector market, and higher demand for our e-series systems. the average selling prices (asps) decreased across all fas system platforms in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to higher
46
discounting and higher demand of newer lower priced products, while the asp for e-series increased due to higher asps on all-flash e-series systems. overall, asps of total configured systems decreased 1% during fiscal 2014 due to higher discounting and product mix.
non-configured product revenues of $1,656.6 million decreased $152.6 million, or 8%, during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. this decrease was primarily due to lower revenues from non-configured oem products, which declined 26%.
total configured system revenues of $2,283.1 million increased by $63.4 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to an increase in revenues from fas entry-level and high-end systems, partially offset by a decrease in fas mid-range systems. total configured systems unit volume increased 9% during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. unit volume for both the fas entry-level and high-end systems increased, while unit volume of the fas mid-range systems decreased, reflecting a shift in customer demand from certain older mid-range systems to certain entry level systems and increased demand for the high-end systems. the asps across all fas configured systems increased due to increased capacity during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. however, asps of total configured systems decreased during fiscal 2013, due to a shift in sales from higher priced fas mid-range systems to lower priced entry level systems.
non-configured product revenues of $1,809.1 million decreased $180.9 million, or 9%, during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. this decrease was primarily due to lower revenues from non-configured oem products, which declined 11%, and lower add-on storage revenues.
our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve. this can cause a wide variation in product configurations that can significantly impact revenues, cost of revenues and gross profits. pricing changes, discounting practices, product competition, foreign currency, unit volumes, customer mix, natural disasters and product materials costs can also impact revenues, cost of revenues and/or gross profits. disks are a significant component of our storage systems. while our sales price per terabyte historically declines over time, improved system performance, increased capacity and software to manage this increased capacity have an offsetting favorable impact on product revenues.

sem revenues are associated with contracts which entitle customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis, as well as bug fixes and patch releases.
the increases in sem revenues in each period were due to increases in the aggregate contract value of the installed base under sem contracts, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the terms of the underlying contracts. in addition, in fiscal 2014, our sem revenues were favorably impacted by a change in our pricing strategy, effective in the fourth quarter of that period, such that we now charge for sem services on the storage capacity sold in our configured systems and add-on storage products. we expect this change to result in favorable trends in our sem revenues as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal 2015.

americas revenues consist of sales to americas commercial and u.s. public sector markets. during fiscal 2014, americas revenues were unfavorably impacted by a decrease in sales to the u.s. public sector market. during fiscal 2013, emea revenues were negatively impacted by the general macroeconomic conditions in the region.
sales to customers inside the united states comprised 89%, 89% and 86% of americas net revenues during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. sales to germany accounted for $632.6 million for fiscal 2012. no other foreign country accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in an individual fiscal year.
cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists of three elements: (1) cost of product revenues, which includes the costs of manufacturing and shipping our storage products, amortization of purchased intangible assets, inventory write-downs, and warranty costs, (2) cost of sem, which includes the costs of providing sem and third-party royalty costs and (3) cost of service revenues, which includes costs associated with providing support activities for hardware maintenance, global support partnership programs, professional services and educational and training services.
our gross profit is impacted by a variety of factors, including pricing changes, discounting practices, foreign currency, product configuration, unit volumes, customer mix, revenue mix, natural disasters and product material costs. service gross profit is typically impacted by factors such as changes in the size of our installed base of products, as well as the timing of support service initiations and renewals, and incremental investments in our customer support infrastructure. if any of these factors that impact our gross profit are adversely affected, whether by economic uncertainties or for other reasons, our gross profit could decline.

cost of product revenues represented 45%, 48% and 47% of product revenues for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
materials cost represented 84%, 83% and 85% of product costs for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
materials cost decreased $129.0 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to an overall decrease in average unit materials cost across all fas platforms, reflecting increased supply chain efficiencies and favorable changes in product mix. additionally, materials cost was favorably impacted by lower oem product volume compared to fiscal 2013 and to lower materials cost of add-on hardware and storage. this decrease was partially offset by a 1.6% unit volume increase in configured systems, resulting in higher gross margins on products compared to fiscal 2013. in addition, cost of product revenues in fiscal 2014 was favorably impacted by a $24.6 million decrease in hardware-related warranty expense and a $14.1 million decrease in excess and obsolete inventory write-downs compared to fiscal 2013.
materials cost decreased $58.9 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to change in mix of configured systems towards lower cost fas entry level systems, lower drive costs and lower oem product volume, resulting in an overall decrease in average unit materials cost. this decrease was partially offset by a 9% unit volume increase in configured systems. in addition, cost of product revenues in fiscal 2013 reflected a $26.9 million increase in hardware-related warranty expense and an $11.7 million increase in inventory write-downs compared to fiscal 2012.

cost of service revenues increased in fiscal 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to increases in spares materials costs and a higher volume of service calls related to a higher service contract base, largely offset by
49
headcount related savings and lower per unit logistics and service delivery costs. cost of service revenues increased in fiscal 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to increases in service contract fulfillment, logistics and service delivery costs. costs represented 41%, 43% and 43% of service revenues for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012.
operating expenses sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses compensation costs comprise the largest component of operating expenses. included in compensation costs are salaries, benefits, other compensation-related costs, stock-based compensation expense and employee incentive compensation plan costs.
total compensation costs included in operating expenses increased $28.2 million, or 2% during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to increases in incentive compensation reflecting stronger operating performance against goals.
total compensation costs included in operating expenses increased $111.1 million, or 7% during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to an increase in salaries, benefits and other compensation-related costs due to an increase in average headcount.

the increase in compensation costs during fiscal 2014 is primarily due to higher incentive compensation. depreciation expense during fiscal 2014 increased due to higher levels of investment in engineering equipment. the decrease in development projects expense during fiscal 2014 reflects lower spending on materials and services associated with engineering activities to develop new product lines and enhancements to existing products.
the increase in compensation costs during fiscal 2013 is primarily due to higher salaries, stock-based compensation and incentive compensation resulting from an increase of 9% in average engineering headcount compared to fiscal 2012. depreciation and amortization expense increased during fiscal 2013 due to higher levels of investment in engineering equipment.
we believe that our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line, develop new products that achieve market acceptance, maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements. we expect to continue to spend on current and future product development efforts, broaden our existing product offerings and introduce new products that expand our solutions portfolio.

during fiscal 2013, we incurred $1.7 million of acquisition costs, primarily related to severance costs associated with the termination of certain acquiree company employees. during fiscal 2012, we incurred $9.8 million of due diligence, legal and integration charges associated with our acquisition of engenio.
restructuring and other charges:
in march 2014 and may 2013, we initiated business realignment plans designed to focus our resources on key strategic initiatives and streamline our business in light of the constrained it spending environment, resulting in a reduction of our global workforce of approximately 11% in aggregate, for which we have recognized an aggregate of $88.3 million of employee severance costs in fiscal 2014. we have completed all activities under the may 2013 plan, and expect to complete activities under the march 2014 plan in the first six months of fiscal 2015, with no significant additional charges.

the effective tax rate of 13.9% in fiscal 2014 included a benefit of $163.3 million, or 22.0 percentage points, from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35%. other key components of our effective tax rate for the year included a benefit of $8.7 million, or 1.2 percentage points, related to current year research and development credits, an expense of $9.8 million, or 1.3 percentage points, attributable to non-deductible stock-based compensation and an expense of $5.6 million, or 0.8 percentage points, related to state tax provisions.
the effective tax rate of 10.8% in fiscal 2013 included a benefit of $144.4 million, or 25.5 percentage points, from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35%. other key components of our effective tax rate for the year included a benefit of $12.1 million, or 2.1 percentage points, related to current year research and development credits, and an expense of $18.4 million, or 3.2 percentage points, attributable to non-deductible stock-based compensation.
the effective tax rate of 15.0% in fiscal 2012 included a benefit of $162.2 million, or 22.8 percentage points, from foreign profits taxed at effective tax rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35%. other key components of our effective tax rate for the year included a benefit of $10.9 million, or 1.5 percentage points, related to research and development credits, an expense of $14.4 million, or 2.0 percentage points, attributable to non-deductible stock-based compensation, an expense of $6.4 million, or 0.9 percentage points, for state tax expense and an expense of $7.3 million, or 1.0 percentage point, in connection with income tax audits.
on january 2, 2013, the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 (the act) was signed into law. under the act, the federal research credit was retroactively extended for amounts paid or incurred after december 31, 2011, and before january 1, 2014. as a result of the extension, in fiscal 2013 we recorded a benefit of $12.1 million related to the fiscal 2013 research credit and a benefit of $3.2 million related to prior year credits that we retroactively claimed. the federal research credit expired on december 31, 2013.
we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the united states and several foreign tax jurisdictions. transfer pricing is a key issue under audit in various jurisdictions, and is often subject to dispute. our fiscal 2005 through 2007 income tax returns are currently under audit by the irs. on may 19, 2014, we received a revenue agents report (rar) from the irs field examination team for the audit period. the rar is subject to further review and approval by certain higher authorities within the irs before submission to the joint committee of taxation for final review and approval. we expect to close our fiscal 2005 through 2007 income tax audit within the next twelve months. our fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 income tax returns are currently under audit by the irs. we are currently in the process of responding to inquiries from the irs examination team. we expect the irs examination team to finish the field audit within the next twelve months. in january 2014, the california franchise tax board temporarily closed the audit of our fiscal 2007 and 2008 income tax returns and will reopen the audit upon the conclusion of the applicable federal irs audits.
our open years in u.s. federal jurisdictions are fiscal 2005 and later years. in addition, we are effectively subject to federal tax examination adjustments for tax years ended on or after fiscal year 2000, in that we have tax attribute carryforwards from these years that could be subject to adjustments, if and when utilized.
on september 17, 2010, the danish tax authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 from our danish subsidiary were subject to danish at-source dividend withholding tax. we do not believe that our danish subsidiary is liable for withholding tax and filed an appeal with the danish tax tribunal to that effect. on december 19, 2011, the danish tax tribunal issued a ruling that our danish subsidiary was not liable for danish withholding tax. the danish tax examination agency appealed the ruling to the danish high court in march 2012.
we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions, as further discussed in note 13
54
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. we believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. given the uncertainties involved in all tax audits, we can only determine a range of estimated potential increase in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $23.5 million to approximately $45.9 million.
liquidity and capital resources the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements, as well as our sources and uses of cash flows on our liquidity and capital resources. the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity. we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high-quality investment grade securities, limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counter-parties and underlying obligors closely. we believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible. we are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of april 25, 2014.

net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents           $(986.1              )                $1,727.3
cash flows as of april 25, 2014, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $1.9 billion from april 26, 2013 to $5.0 billion. the decrease was primarily due to the repayment of the principal amount of our convertible notes of $1.3 billion and $1.9 billion in cash paid for the repurchase of our common stock, partially offset by $1.3 billion of cash provided by operating activities. we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our operating cash flows and from working capital. accounts receivable days sales outstanding as of april 25, 2014 were 47 days compared to 42 days as of april 26, 2013. working capital decreased by $0.8 billion to $3.8 billion as of april 25, 2014 as a result of a decrease of $1.9 billion in current assets, primarily due to the net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 billion in current liabilities, primarily due to the maturity of our convertible notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2014.
cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2014, we generated cash from operating activities of $1.3 billion. the primary sources of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2014 consisted of net income of $637.5 million, adjusted by depreciation and amortization of $334.1 million and stock-based compensation of $273.0 million.
55
changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2014 included the following:
   accounts receivable increased primarily due to the impact of more back-ended shipment linearity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.

   deferred revenue increased due to an increase in deferred sem and service revenue.

during fiscal 2013, we generated cash from operating activities of $1.4 billion. the primary sources of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2013 consisted of net income of $505.3 million, adjusted by depreciation and amortization of $344.6 million and stock-based compensation of $276.6 million.
changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2013 included the following:
   deferred revenue increased due to an increase in deferred sem and service revenues.

   accrued compensation and other current liabilities increased due to an increase in hardware-related warranty accruals and employee compensation plans.

we expect that cash provided by operating activities may materially fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, shipment linearity, accounts receivable collections performance, inventory and supply chain management, tax benefits or charges from stock-based compensation, and the timing and amount of compensation and other payments.
cash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2014, we generated $975.0 million from maturities and sales of investments, net of purchases, and paid $221.4 million for capital expenditures.
during fiscal 2013, we generated $177.0 million from maturities and sales of investments, net of purchases, completed business acquisitions for net cash payments of $106.5 million and paid $303.3 million for capital expenditures, including $69.6 million related to buildings and land associated with the buyout of our remaining synthetic leases.
cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2014, we used $1.3 billion for the principal repayment of our convertible notes and used $1.9 billion for the repurchase of 47.3 million shares of our common stock and the purchase of a related forward contract.
during fiscal 2013, we generated $987.3 million, net, from the issuance of long-term debt, used $590.0 million for the repurchase of 18.1 million shares of common stock and received an aggregate of $183.5 million of proceeds and excess tax benefits from employee equity award plans, net of shares withheld for taxes.
liquidity our principal sources of liquidity as of april 25, 2014 consisted of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as cash we expect to generate from operations.
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consist of the following (in millions):
april 25, 2014      april 26, 2013
cash and cash equivalents            $2,291.0            $3,277.1
short-term investments                2,712.3             3,675.5
total                                $5,003.3            $6,952.6
56
as of april 25, 2014 and april 26, 2013, $4.3 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was held by various foreign subsidiaries and was generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings, while $0.7 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, was available in the united states. most of the amounts held outside the united states can be repatriated to the united states but, under current law, would be subject to u.s. federal, state income and foreign withholding taxes. if we were to repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the united states, we would incur u.s. federal and state income taxes reduced by the current amount of our u.s. federal and state tax credit carry forwards. however, our intent is to keep these funds permanently reinvested outside of the united states, and our current plans do not contemplate a need to repatriate them to fund our u.s. operations. our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, fund research and development, meet capital expenditure needs, invest in critical or complementary technologies, and service interest and principal payments on our debt.
key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability, our ability to effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts receivable and inventories, the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends, our ability to effectively integrate acquired products, businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt. based on past performance and our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of liquidity, including potential future issuances of debt, equity or other securities, will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. however, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements. we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all.
our investment portfolio, including auction rate securities, has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets. we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio. we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties.
senior notes the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes as of april 25, 2014 (in millions):
2.00% senior notes due 2017        $750.0
3.25% senior notes due 2022         250.0
total      $1,000.0
interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually. for further information on the underlying terms, see note 9 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
credit facility our credit facility, under which we may borrow up to $250.0 million, provides another potential source of liquidity. the credit facility is an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility that terminates on december 21,
57
2017 if no extensions have been requested at that time, and contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. we may also, subject to certain requirements, request an increase in the facility up to an additional $100.0 million and request two additional one-year extensions, subject to certain conditions. as of april 25, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the facility and we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the facility.
we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which, subsequent to year-end on june 5, 2014, we completed a debt offering and raised $494.7 million, net of discount and offering costs, through the issuance of long-term debt, as further discussed in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements. we may in the future offer an additional unspecified amount of debt, equity and other securities.
capital expenditure requirements we expect to fund our capital expenditures, including our commitments related to facilities, equipment, operating leases and internal-use software development projects over the next few years through existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations. the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors, including future demand for products, changes in the network storage industry, hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements. our capital expenditures were $221.4 million during fiscal 2014. we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 to be between $200.0 million and $250.0 million.
dividends and stock repurchase program on may 21, 2014, we declared a cash dividend of $0.165 per share of common stock, payable on july 22, 2014 to holders of record as of the close of business on july 10, 2014.
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $7.1 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, including an increase of $1.6 billion approved by our board of directors in may 2013. under this program, we can purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through open market and privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by our management. the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. since the may 13, 2003 inception of this program through april 25, 2014, we repurchased a total of 184.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $32.55 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $6.0 billion. as of april 25, 2014, the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was $1.1 billion with no termination date, which we plan to complete by may 2015.
the timing and amount of stock repurchase transactions and future dividends will depend on market conditions, corporate business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements.
58
contractual obligations the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at april 25, 2014 (in millions):
fiscal year                                           2015            2016            2017          2018            2019             thereafter            total off-balance sheet commitments:

other commercial commitments:
letters of credit                                              $5.1            $3.0          $1.8            $1.6          $0.1            $1.0            $12.6
(1)                                              contract manufacturer commitments consist of obligations for on-hand inventories and non-cancelable purchase orders with our contract manufacturers. we recorded a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts through a charge to cost of product sales. as of april 25, 2014, such liability amounted to $11.5 million and is included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

(2)                                                      purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than commitments with contract manufacturers, for which we have not received the goods or services. purchase obligations do not include contracts that may be cancelled without penalty. although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.

(3)                              included in long-term debt are obligations related to our $1.0 billion principal amount of our senior notes, of which $750.0 million is due in december
2017 and $250.0 million is due in december 2022. estimated interest payments for our long-term debt, assuming no early retirement of debt obligations are $133.1 million for fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2023.

(4)   as of april 25, 2014, our liability for uncertain tax positions was $180.0 million, including interest and penalties, which due to the uncertainty of the timing of future payments, are presented in the total column on a separate line in this table.

some of the amounts in the table above are based on managements estimates and assumptions, including the commitment duration, the possibility of renewal or termination, anticipated actions by management and third parties and other factors. because these estimates and assumptions are subjective, our actual future obligations may vary from those reflected in the table.
legal contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business. see further details on such matters in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by us or our subsidiaries. as of april 25, 2014, our financial guarantees of $12.6 million that were not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet consisted primarily of standby letters of credit and surety bonds.
59
in the ordinary course of business, some of our customers have entered into recourse and non-recourse financing leasing arrangements using third-party financing companies, and in some situations, we enter into customer financing arrangements for our products and services that are contemporaneously sold on a recourse or non-recourse basis to third-party financing companies. during the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default. where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases, we defer revenues subject to the industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance, and recognize revenues for non-software deliverables in accordance with our multiple deliverable revenue arrangement policy. in connection with certain recourse financing arrangements, we receive advance payments associated with undelivered elements that are subject to customer refund rights. we defer revenue associated with these advance payments until the related refund rights expire and we perform the services. as of april 25, 2014, the maximum guaranteed payment contingencies under our financing arrangements totaled $205.8 million and the related deferred revenue totaled $193.1 million.
we enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business. generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third-parties due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement. these indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements under accounting guidance.

overview we believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth. we define comparable warehouse sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, as well as online sales related to websites operating for more than one year. comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing the shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit. sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations) and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions (primarily impacting domestic operations). the higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, especially the united states. sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, including a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet-based retailers. while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items.
our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at the most competitive prices. we do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our "pricing authority" - consistently providing the most competitive values. our investments in merchandise pricing can, from time to time, include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting near-term gross margin as a percentage of sales. we believe our gasoline business draws members to our warehouses, but it has a lower gross margin as a percentage of net sales relative to our non-gasoline business. a higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin as a percentage of net sales.
we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses. as our warehouse base grows however, available and desirable potential sites become more difficult and potentially more expensive to secure, and square footage growth may become a comparatively less substantial component of sales growth. the negative aspects of such growth, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are increasingly less significant relative to the results of our total operations. our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue.
our membership format is an integral part of our business model and has a significant effect on our profitability. this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our executive members, and sustain high renewal rates, materially influences our profitability.
our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs. while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically, some significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn. rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. this may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularly gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.
our operating model is generally the same across our u.s., canada, and other international operating segments (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report). certain countries in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales, and/or less direct membership warehouse competition. additionally, we operate our gasoline business only in the u.s., canada, australia, and u.k.
in discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. this impact of foreign-

exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior-year period's currency exchange rates.
our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august 31. fiscal years 2014 and 2013 were 52-week fiscal years ending on august 31, 2014, and september 1, 2013, respectively, while fiscal year 2012 was a 53-week fiscal year ending on september 2, 2012. certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to costco.
highlights for fiscal year 2014 included:
•   we opened 30 new warehouses in 2014, 17 in the u.s., 3 in canada, and 10 in our other international segment, compared to 26 new warehouses in 2013;
•   net sales increased 7% to $110,212, driven by a 4% increase in comparable sales and sales at warehouses opened in 2013 and 2014. net and comparable sales were negatively impacted by changes in certain foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar;
•   membership fees increased 6% to $2,428, primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and executive membership upgrades, partially offset by the negative impact of changes in certain foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar;
•   gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) as a percentage of net sales increased four basis points;
•   selling, general and administrative (sg&amp;a) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased seven basis points, primarily due to continued investment in modernizing our information systems;
•   net income in 2014 increased to $2,058, or $4.65 per diluted share compared to $2,039, or $4.63 per diluted share in 2013. the prior year results were positively impacted by a $62 tax benefit, or $0.14 per diluted share, in connection with the special cash dividend paid to the company's 401(k) plan participants;
•   changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar adversely impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.10, primarily due to changes in the canadian dollar; and
•   the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.31 to $0.355 per share in april 2014.

2014 vs. 2013
net sales net sales increased $7,342 or 7% during 2014. this was attributable to a 4% increase in comparable warehouse sales, and sales at warehouses opened in 2013 and 2014. changes in foreign currencies negatively impacted net sales by approximately $1,336, or 130 basis points, compared to 2013. the negative impact was primarily due to the canadian dollar of approximately $1,140 and the japanese yen of approximately $311. changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by approximately $364, or 35 basis points, due to a 3% decrease in average sales price per gallon.
comparable sales comparable sales increased 4% during 2014 and were primarily impacted by an increase in shopping frequency. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar and gasoline prices negatively impacted comparable sales results, including the average amount spent by our members during 2014. in local currencies, international comparable sales increased 7%; 9% in canada and 4% in our other international segment. the increase in comparable sales also includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations), primarily in our other international operations.
2013 vs. 2012
net sales net sales increased $5,808 or 6% during 2013. this increase was attributable to a 6% increase in comparable warehouse sales and sales at warehouses opened in 2012 and 2013, partially offset by the impact of one additional week of sales in 2012. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $208, or 21 basis points during 2013. the negative impact was primarily due to the japanese yen of approximately $354, partially offset by a positive impact of the mexican peso of approximately $127. changes in gasoline prices were immaterial to the change in net sales.

2014 vs. 2013
membership fees increased 6% in 2014. this increase was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and increased number of upgrades to our higher-fee executive membership program. the raising of our membership fees in fiscal 2012 positively impacted 2014 by $9. these increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, which negatively impacted membership fees by approximately $35 in 2014. our member renewal rates are currently 91% in the u.s. and canada and 87% worldwide.
we increased our annual membership fees in the u.s. and canada effective november 1, 2011, for new members, and january 1, 2012, for renewal members. we account for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period.
2013 vs. 2012
membership fees increased 10% in 2013. the increase was primarily due to raising our annual membership fees and membership sign-ups at both existing and new warehouses. the fee increase had a positive impact on membership fee revenues of approximately $119 and $37 in 2013 and 2012, respectively. these increases were partially offset by the impact of one additional week of membership fees in 2012.

2014 vs. 2013
gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased four basis points. gross margin in our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods) when expressed as a percentage of net sales increased six basis points, primarily due to increases in our softlines and food and sundries categories, partially offset by a decrease in hardlines. fresh foods also had a positive impact as a result of higher sales penetration. warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margin when expressed as a percentage of net sales increased by six basis points. gross margin as a percentage of net sales was negatively impacted by seven basis points primarily due to a $28 lifo inventory charge in 2014 compared to a $27 benefit in 2013 and a nonrecurring legal settlement that increased gross margin in 2013. the lifo charge resulted from higher costs for our merchandise inventories, primarily our foods and fresh foods categories. excluding the effect of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased one basis point. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by $151 in 2014.
gross margin in our core merchandise categories when expressed as a percentage of their own merchandise category sales increased seven basis points. the changes in the individual merchandise categories are consistent with the discussion above.

when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales, gross margin increased in our u.s. operations, primarily due to our softlines and food and sundries categories, partially offset by a decrease in hardlines and the lifo charge and legal settlement discussed above. the gross margin percentage in our canadian operations decreased, primarily due to decreases in hardlines and food and sundries, partially offset by an increase in fresh foods. the gross margin percentage in our other international segment increased, primarily due to fresh foods.
2013 vs. 2012
gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased seven basis points. gross margin in our core merchandise categories when expressed as a percentage of net sales decreased four basis points, primarily due to a decrease in fresh foods as a result of our continued investment in merchandise pricing. warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margin when expressed as a percentage of net sales increased by six basis points, predominately in our optical and hearing aid businesses. additionally, gross margin was positively impacted by five basis points due to a $27 lifo inventory benefit in 2013, compared to a charge of $21 in 2012, and two basis points due to a legal settlement. the lifo benefit resulted from lower costs for our merchandise inventories, primarily hardlines. executive membership 2% reward program negatively impacted gross margin by two basis points, due to increased spending by executive members.
gross margin for core merchandise categories when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales) decreased two basis points, primarily due to a decrease in fresh foods.
when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales, gross margin increased in our u.s. operations primarily due to improvements in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. the lifo benefit and legal settlement also benefited our u.s. operations. these improvements were slightly offset by a decrease in fresh foods. the gross margin percentage in our canadian operations was flat, resulting from a decrease in fresh foods, offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. the gross margin percentage in our other international segment decreased, primarily in fresh foods.

2014 vs. 2013
sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased seven basis points. excluding the effect of gasoline price deflation on net sales, sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased four basis points. this increase was largely due to an increase in central operating costs of three basis points primarily due to continued investment in modernizing our information systems, primarily incurred by our u.s. operations. stock compensation expense was also higher by two basis points due to accelerated vesting for long service and appreciation in the trading price of our stock, despite a 14% reduction in the average number of rsus granted to each participant. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for discussion of accelerated vesting. warehouse operating costs were lower by one basis point, primarily resulting from improvements in payroll in our canadian operations as a result of leveraging increased sales, partially offset by increases in employee benefit costs, primarily health care, in our u.s. operations. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar decreased our sg&a expenses by $119 in 2014.
2013 vs. 2012
sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased one basis point. this increase was driven by higher stock compensation expense of three basis points, partially offset by contributions made to an initiative reforming alcohol beverage laws in washington state in the first quarter of 2012, with no comparable charge in 2013, which resulted in a positive impact of two basis points. central operating costs as a percent of net sales were flat, primarily due to the benefit of lower non-equity incentive compensation costs as a result of not meeting certain internal performance targets. this was offset by higher central operating costs, predominately related to the continued investment in modernizing our information systems, primarily incurred by our u.s. operations. warehouse operating costs as a percentage of net sales were flat, primarily due to leveraging payroll costs in our u.s. and canadian operations as a result of increased net sales which was offset by increases in other operating costs, primarily employee benefits and workers' compensation.

interest expense      $113             $99             $95
interest expense in 2014 primarily relates to our $1,100 of 5.5% senior notes issued in fiscal 2007 and our $3,500 of senior notes issued in december 2012 (described in further detail under the heading "cash flows from financing activities" and in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report).

2014 vs. 2013
the increase in interest income in 2014 was primarily driven by higher average cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balances, primarily in our u.s. operations. the decrease in net foreign-currency transaction gains was primarily attributable to the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and monetary liabilities during the year, primarily our japanese subsidiary's u.s. dollar-denominated payables. see derivatives and foreign currency sections in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.

the decrease in interest income in 2013 was primarily attributable to lower interest rates earned on our u.s. cash balances. there was a decrease in the positive impact of net foreign-currency transaction gains resulting from the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and monetary liabilities during the year. this was partially offset by a positive impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to foreign exchange contracts entered into by our foreign subsidiaries, as the u.s. dollar was slightly stronger in certain international locations compared to 2012.

provision for income taxes
2014                                                    2013                2012
provision for income taxes      $1,109              $990              $1,000
effective tax rate                34.7   %          32.4   %            36.1   %
our provision for income taxes for 2013 was favorably impacted by nonrecurring net tax benefits of $77, primarily due to a $62 tax benefit recorded in connection with the special cash dividend paid to employees through our 401(k) retirement plan. dividends paid on these shares are deductible for u.s. income tax purposes.
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents:
2014                             2013                2012
net cash provided by operating activities                    $3,984              $3,437              $3,057
net cash used in investing activities                        (2,093   )          (2,251   )          (1,236   )
net cash (used in) provided by financing activities            (786   )              44              (2,281   )
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances. cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $7,315 and $6,124 at the end of 2014 and 2013, respectively. of these balances, approximately $1,383 and $1,254 at the end of 2014 and 2013, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the last week of our fiscal year.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, we changed our position regarding a portion of the undistributed earnings of our canadian operations, which is no longer considered permanently reinvested. current exchange rates compared to historical rates when these earnings were generated resulted in an immaterial u.s. tax liability, which was recorded at the end of 2014. canadian withholding taxes, which are creditable against federal income taxes, have also been accrued on the amount expected to be repatriated.
management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. we have not provided for u.s. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain non-u.s. consolidated subsidiaries as we deem such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested. this includes the remaining undistributed earnings of our canadian operations that management continues to assert are indefinitely reinvested. we believe that our u.s. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our u.s. liquidity requirements and have no current plans to repatriate for use in the u.s. cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by these non-u.s. consolidated subsidiaries. cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held at these subsidiaries and considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled $1,809 at august 31, 2014.
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3,984 in 2014 compared to $3,437 in 2013. our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. our cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors, warehouse operating costs including payroll and employee benefits, credit card processing fees, and utilities. cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes.
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,093 in 2014 compared to $2,251 in 2013. our cash flow used in investing activities is primarily related to funding our warehouse expansion and remodeling activities. net cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments.
capital expenditure plans we opened 30 new warehouses and one new depot in 2014 and plan to open up to 35 new warehouses in 2015, including the relocation of four warehouses. our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. to a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations, the modernization of our

information systems, and working capital. in 2014 we spent $1,993 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $2,500 to $2,700 during fiscal 2015. these expenditures are expected to be financed with cash to be provided from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs.
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled $786 in 2014 compared to $44 provided by financing activities in 2013. the primary uses of cash in 2014 were dividend payments, repurchases of common stock, and payment of withholding taxes on stock-based awards. the net cash provided by financing activities in 2013 primarily resulted from the proceeds of the issuance of $3,500 in aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which were used to fund a one-time special cash dividend of $3,049 in december 2012. these cash flows did not recur in 2014.
stock repurchase programs during 2014 and 2013, we repurchased 2,915,000 and 357,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $114.45 and $96.41, totaling approximately $334 and $34, respectively. the remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $2,721 at the end of 2014. purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under sec rule 10b5-1. repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the washington business corporation act.
dividends in april 2014, our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.31 to $0.355 per share. our cash dividends paid in 2014 totaled $1.33 per share, as compared to $8.17 per share in 2013, which included a special cash dividend of $7.00 per share.
bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs we maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. at august 31, 2014, we had borrowing capacity within these facilities of $451, of which $381 was maintained by our international operations. of the $381, $180 is guaranteed by the company. there were no outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2014 and $36 outstanding at the end of 2013.
the company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $154. the outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2014 totaled $95, including $91 in standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. the bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, all within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities prior to their expiration. the amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit then outstanding.

_______________
(1)   includes only open merchandise purchase orders.
(2)   includes contractual interest payments.
(3)   operating lease obligations exclude amounts for common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $149 to reflect sub-lease income.
(4)   the amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.
(5)   includes $55 in asset retirement obligations and $48 in deferred compensation obligations. the total amount excludes $54 of non-current unrecognized tax contingencies and $25 of other obligations due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that in the opinion of management have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) requires that we make estimates and judgments. we continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, insurance/self-insurance liabilities, and income taxes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. for further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.
revenue recognition we generally recognize sales, which include shipping fees where applicable, net of returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis.
we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned. generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue and related shipping fees are recorded on a gross basis. if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts earned, which is reflected in net sales.

item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data) (continued)
we account for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. our executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum of approximately $750 per year), which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses. we account for this reward as a reduction in sales. the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non-redemptions based on historical data.
investments investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. we employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (lifo) method for substantially all u.s. merchandise inventories. merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first-in, first-out (fifo) method. we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. we record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end.
we provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year.
inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches.
impairment of long-lived assets we evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in circumstances occur that may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair market value.
insurance/self-insurance liabilities we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including for certain risks, a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers' compensation, general liability, property damage, directors' and officers' liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. when facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate.

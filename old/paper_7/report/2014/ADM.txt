item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview this md&a should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
the company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  the company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities, connecting to markets in 147 countries.  the company also processes corn, oilseeds, wheat and cocoa into products for food, animal feed, chemical and energy uses.  the company uses its global asset network, business acumen, and its relationships with suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for our shareholders, principally from margins earned on these activities.
the company's operations are organized, managed and classified into three reportable business segments: oilseeds processing, corn processing, and agricultural services.  each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  the company's remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as other.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, the company completed the acquisition of wild flavors and sci for a total consideration of $2.9 billion, making the company one of the world's leading flavors and specialty ingredients companies. effective january 1, 2015, the company has formed a fourth reportable business segment, wild flavors and specialty ingredients. results of wild flavors and sci were reported in other as the 2014 results were not material to the company.
the oilseeds processing segment includes global activities related to the origination, merchandising, crushing, and further processing of oilseeds such as soybeans and soft seeds (cottonseed, sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, and flaxseed) into vegetable oils and protein meals.  oilseeds products produced and marketed by the company include ingredients for the food, feed, energy, and industrial products industries.  crude vegetable oils produced by the segment's crushing activities are sold "as is" or are further processed by refining, blending, bleaching, and deodorizing into salad oils.  salad oils are sold "as is" or are further processed by hydrogenating and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food products. partially refined oils are used to produce biodiesel or are sold to other manufacturers for use in chemicals, paints, and other industrial products.  oilseed protein meals are principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in commercial livestock and poultry feeds.  in europe and south america, the oilseeds processing segment includes origination and merchandising activities as adjuncts to its oilseeds processing assets.  these activities include a network of grain elevators, port facilities, and transportation assets used to buy, store, clean, and transport grains and oilseeds.  the oilseeds processing segment produces natural health and nutrition products and other specialty food and feed ingredients.  the oilseeds processing segment is a major supplier of peanuts and peanut-derived ingredients to both the u.s. and export markets.  in north america, cottonseed flour is produced and sold primarily to the pharmaceutical industry and cotton cellulose pulp is manufactured and sold to the chemical, paper, and filter markets. the oilseeds processing segment also includes activities related to the procurement, transportation and processing of cocoa beans into cocoa liquor, cocoa butter, cocoa powder, chocolate, and various compounds in north america, south america, europe, asia, and africa for the food processing industry.   the oilseeds processing segment also includes the company's share of the results of its equity investment in wilmar and its share of results for its stratas foods llc and edible oils limited joint ventures. prior to december 2014, the oilseeds processing segment operated fertilizer blending facilities in south america. in december 2014, the company completed the sale of its fertilizer blending business.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the company's corn processing segment is engaged in corn wet milling and dry milling activities, with its asset base primarily located in the central part of the united states.  the corn processing segment converts corn into sweeteners and starches, and bioproducts.  its products include ingredients used in the food and beverage industry including sweeteners, starch, syrup, glucose, and dextrose.  dextrose and starch are used by the corn processing segment as feedstocks for its bioproducts operations.  by fermentation of dextrose, the corn processing segment produces alcohol, amino acids, and other specialty food and animal feed ingredients.  ethyl alcohol is produced by the company for industrial use as ethanol or as beverage grade.  ethanol, in gasoline, increases octane and is used as an extender and oxygenate.  bioproducts also include amino acids such as lysine and threonine that are vital compounds used in swine feeds to produce leaner animals and in poultry feeds to enhance the speed and efficiency of poultry production.  corn gluten feed and meal, as well as distillers' grains, are produced for use as animal feed ingredients.  corn germ, a by-product of the wet milling process, is further processed into vegetable oil and protein meal.  other corn processing products include citric and lactic acids, lactates, sorbitol, xanthan gum, and glycols which are used in various food and industrial products.  the corn processing segment includes the activities of a propylene and ethylene glycol facility and the company's brazilian sugarcane ethanol plant and related operations.  this segment also includes the company's share of the results of its equity investments in almidones mexicanos s.a., eaststarch c.v., and red star yeast company llc.
the agricultural services segment utilizes its extensive u.s. grain elevator, global transportation network, and port operations to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley, and resells these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients and as raw materials for the agricultural processing industry.  the agricultural services' grain sourcing, handling, and transportation network provides reliable and efficient services to the company's customers and agricultural processing operations. agricultural services' transportation network capabilities include barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, and rail freight services.  agricultural services segment also includes the activities related to the processing of wheat into wheat flour, the processing and distribution of formula feeds, animal health and nutrition products, and the procurement, processing, and distribution of edible beans.  the agricultural services segment includes the activities of toepfer, a global merchant of agricultural commodities and processed products.  on june 6, 2014, the company announced that it has completed its acquisition of the remaining 20% interest in toepfer. the agricultural services segment also includes the company's 32.2% share of the results of its pacificor (formerly kalama export company llc) joint venture and returns associated with the company's 19.8% investment in graincorp. prior to december 2012, the company had a 23.2% interest in gruma s.a.b. de c.v. (gruma), the world's largest producer and marketer of corn flour and tortillas.  additionally, the company had joint ventures in corn flour and wheat flour mills with and through gruma.  in december 2012, the company sold its 23.2% interest in gruma and the gruma-related joint ventures.
other includes the activities of wild flavors, sci, and the company's remaining operations, primarily its financial business units, related principally to futures commission merchant and insurance activities.
corporate results principally include the impact of lifo-related inventory adjustments, unallocated corporate expenses, interest cost net of investment income, and the company's share of the results of an equity investment. corporate results also include the after-tax elimination of income attributable to the minority shareholder of toepfer except during the calendar year 2012 when the put options related to these interests expired and the results were included in noncontrolling interest. the company acquired the remaining 20% interest in toepfer during the second quarter of 2014, thus no longer requiring the elimination of income attributable to the minority shareholder as of june 30, 2014.
significant ongoing portfolio management actions the company's recently announced additional significant actions in its portfolio management include:
•   completing the sale of its fertilizer blending business in brazil and paraguay on december 17, 2014 following the announcement of a signed agreement with the mosaic company to sell the business on april 15, 2014;
•   announcing the sale of its global chocolate business to cargill, inc. for $440 million on september 2, 2014;
•   announcing the sale of its global cocoa business to olam international limited for $1.3 billion on december 15, 2014; and
•   signing an agreement with glencore plc to sell a 50 percent stake in its export terminal in barcarena, in the northern brazilian state of pará on february 3, 2015.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the chocolate, cocoa, and export terminal transactions are expected to close in 2015, subject to completion of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, which are in process. the chocolate and cocoa businesses are classified as held for sale as of december 31, 2014.
operating performance indicators the company's oilseeds processing and agricultural services operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials.  therefore, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold.  thus, changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit.
the company's corn processing operations and certain other food and animal feed processing operations also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials.  however, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily equal changes in cost of products sold. thus, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit.
the company has consolidated subsidiaries in 79 countries.  for the majority of the company's subsidiaries located outside the united states, the local currency is the functional currency.  revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into u.s. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods.  for the majority of the company's business activities in brazil, the functional currency is the u.s. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require conversion to the functional currency.  fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the euro, british pound, canadian dollar, and brazilian real, as compared to the u.s. dollar can result in corresponding fluctuations in the u.s. dollar value of revenues and expenses reported by the company.
the company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, segment operating profit, return on invested capital, ebitda, economic value added, and cost per metric ton.  the company's operating results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings,  government programs and policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  due to these unpredictable factors, the company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013
as an agricultural commodity-based business, the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company's operating results. demand for global protein meal and vegetable oil remained strong and steady. demand for export of north american corn and soybeans was strong, but logistical challenges during the winter months, including rail delays and river freezes, caused higher costs making u.s. exports less competitive. despite a large harvest in south america, u.s. grain exports continued for longer than normal in 2014 due to slow south american farmer selling. u.s. corn and wheat storage and merchandising opportunities were limited for much of the year until the 2014 record fall harvest. corn sweetener demand was steady. strong u.s. ethanol demand from both domestic and export markets, combined with industry logistical and production challenges in the winter months, led to volatile but strong overall 2014 ethanol margins. south american grain and oilseed origination volumes and margins were challenged by the slow farmer selling. cocoa press margins have continued to improve from last year when margins were negatively impacted by excess capacity.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased $0.9 billion to $2.2 billion. segment operating profit was $3.9 billion, up 45%, due primarily to improved corn processing and grain merchandising and handling results. included in this year's segment operating profit was a gain of approximately $156 million upon the company's effective dilution in the pacificor (formerly kalama export company) joint venture, resulting from the contribution of additional assets by another member in exchange for new equity units, a gain of $126 million on the sale of the fertilizer business, long-lived asset impairment charges of $35 million, and wild flavors restructuring charges and acquisition costs of $33 million. in 2013, segment operating profit included a $155 million write-down related to the company's graincorp investment, a $51 million impairment of certain long-lived assets at its brazilian sugar mill, and approximately $27 million of other long-lived asset impairment charges principally in the corn processing segment. excluding these unique items, segment operating profit improved approximately 26% in 2014. corporate costs of $785 million in 2014 were higher by $101 million. included in 2014 costs were losses of $102 million on euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the anticipated wild flavors acquisition and $98 million of non-cash pension settlement charges. the prior year period included $54 million of charges related to an anti-corruption settlement, losses of $40 million on australian dollar foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the proposed graincorp acquisition, $21 million costs related to strategic projects, and costs of $32 million primarily related to asset write-downs and allocations of costs between corporate and the operating segments. in 2014, lifo inventory reserves declined resulting in pretax lifo credits to earnings of $245 million compared to lifo credits of $225 million in 2013. excluding lifo and these other items, corporate costs increased $68 million, which is primarily due to higher enterprise resource planning project, i.t., and other project-related costs. partially offsetting the increase was lower interest expense due principally to lower outstanding long-term debt balances.
the company's effective tax rate for 2014 was 28.0% compared to 33.1% for 2013. the 2014 rate was positively impacted by $47 million of positive discrete tax adjustments and a slight favorable shift in the geographic mix of earnings. the 2013 rate was negatively impacted by valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, partially offset by favorable discrete income tax benefits related to amounts received from the u.s. government in the form of biodiesel credits. excluding these factors, the effective tax rate for 2013 was approximately 30%.
analysis of statements of earnings processed volumes by product for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows (in metric tons):

revenues in 2014 decreased 10% to $81.2 billion due principally to lower average sales prices ($8.0 billion) related to a decrease in underlying commodity prices, lower overall sales volumes ($0.7 billion), and changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $0.2 billion partially offset by higher revenues in other ($0.3 billion) due to recent acquisitions. the decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on cost of products sold. oilseeds processing revenues decreased 10% to $31.5 billion due principally to lower sales volumes for soybeans and soybean meal ($1.9 billion) and lower average sales prices ($1.4 billion). corn processing revenues decreased 11% to $11.7 billion due principally to lower average sales prices ($1.6 billion) partially offset by higher sales volumes ($0.1 billion). agricultural services revenues decreased 10% to $37.3 billion due principally to lower average sales prices ($5.2 billion) and partially offset by higher sales volumes ($1.1 billion).
cost of products sold decreased 11% to $76.4 billion due principally to lower average commodity costs partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. included in 2014 cost of products sold is a credit of $245 million from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of $225 million in 2013. manufacturing expenses increased $0.2 billion mostly due to higher energy costs and higher maintenance costs. higher energy costs were driven by unusually high volatility of natural gas prices during the winter months early in the year due primarily to supply interruptions impacted by the severe winter weather conditions.
selling, general, and administrative expenses (sg&a) increased $148 million to $1.9 billion due principally to a $98 million non-cash pretax pension settlement charge related to settling certain u.s. retiree liabilities with lump sum payments and incremental sg&a expenses of $73 million related to the acquired wild flavors and sci businesses, partially offset by the absence of the prior year charge of $54 million related to an anti-corruption settlement. in addition, salaries and benefits and enterprise resource planning project, information technology, and other project-related costs were higher year over year.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs of $105 million include $16 million of costs associated with the relocation of the company's global headquarters to chicago, illinois, $48 million of restructuring charges related primarily to the wild flavors acquisition and toepfer integration following the acquisition of the minority interest, other-than-temporary investment writedown of $6 million, and property, plant, and equipment asset impairments of $35 million. the 2013 charges of $259 million were comprised of other-than-temporary impairment charges of $155 million on the company's graincorp investment, asset impairment charges of $51 million related to the company's brazilian sugar milling business, and other impairment charges principally for certain property, plant, and equipment assets totaling $53 million.
interest expense decreased $76 million to $337 million primarily due to lower outstanding long-term debt balances. during february 2014, the company repaid $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes with available funds.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $39 million to $372 million primarily due to lower earnings from the company's investments in cip and wilmar.
other income increased $194 million to $247 million due principally to a gain of $156 million upon the company's effective dilution in the pacificor (formerly kalama export company) joint venture, resulting from the contribution of additional assets by another member in exchange for new equity units, a gain of $126 million on the sale of the south american fertilizer business, and the absence of prior year losses of $40 million on australian dollar foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the proposed graincorp acquisition, partially offset by current period losses of $102 million on euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the wild flavors acquisition.

oilseeds processing operating profit increased $132 million to $1.6 billion. included in the current year operating profit is a charge of approximately $17 million for cocoa hedge timing effects compared to a charge of approximately $13 million in the prior year. crushing and origination operating profit increased $33 million to $868 million. included in the current year results is a gain on sale of the fertilizer business of $126 million. excluding this gain the crushing and origination operating profit decreased by $93 million primarily due to lower south american grain origination results caused by year-over-year slower farmer-selling, reduced crush margins and lower fertilizer results partially offset by strong soybean and softseed volumes and margins in north america and europe. refining, packaging, biodiesel, and other results improved $24 million to $478 million on good demand and improved margins for refined and packaged oils and improved european biodiesel results. cocoa and other results, including the mark-to-market timing effects discussed above, improved $125 million to $92 million as cocoa press margins significantly increased. asia results declined $50 million to $167 million, principally reflecting a decrease from the company's share of its results from its equity investee, wilmar.
corn processing operating profit increased $374 million to $1.2 billion. included in the current period operating profit is a gain of approximately $25 million for corn hedge timing effects and $15 million of asset impairment charges; while the prior period included a charge of approximately $15 million for corn hedge time effects and $71 million of asset impairment charges. excluding these items, sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $39 million primarily due to lower average selling prices partially offset by lower net corn costs. also contributing to the decrease were decreased co-products income, an additional $8 million in bad debt reserve and $7 million of startup costs related to the new sweetener facility in tianjin, china. excluding corn hedge timing effects and asset impairment charges, bioproducts profit in the current year improved by $317 million as solid demand for u.s. ethanol from domestic and export markets, lower net corn costs, and lower industry production volumes early in the year caused by logistical and production challenges combined to drive volatile but overall strong margins.
agricultural services operating profit increased $709 million to $1.1 billion. current year results in merchandising and handling include a gain of $156 million upon the company's effective dilution in the pacificor (formerly kalama export company) joint venture, resulting from the contribution of additional assets by another member in exchange for new equity units and asset impairment charges of $14 million. prior year results included an approximately $30 million intercompany insurance-related gain and a $155 million asset impairment charge related to the other than temporary impairment of the company's graincorp investment. excluding these items, merchandising and handling operating profit increased $353 million due principally to higher u.s. grain export volumes and improvement in international merchandising results. transportation operating profit improved $110 million to $187 million due to higher volumes and freight rates in barge operations. milling and other results declined $21 million to $249 million on lower margins and volumes in the milling business for most of the year reducing opportunities for grain and feed merchandising.
other processing operating profit reflects a loss of $46 million due primarily to the results of wild flavors and sci which were acquired by the company in the fourth quarter of 2014. wild flavors' results include $33 million in restructuring charges and acquisition costs and $23 million in additional expense for the amortization of fair value adjustments primarily related to inventories. other financial operating profit increased $38 million to $79 million mainly due to the absence of an approximately $30 million insurance-related loss in the prior year which offset the insurance-related gain reported in the agricultural services segment.
corporate results were a net charge of $785 million in the current year compared to a net charge of $684 million in the prior year. the effects of decreasing commodity prices on lifo inventory valuations resulted in a credit of $245 million in the current year compared to a credit of $225 million in the prior year. interest expense - net declined $90 million due principally to lower outstanding long-term debt balances. unallocated corporate costs increased $83 million primarily due to higher expenses related to the enterprise resource planning project, special strategic projects, and compensation accruals. other charges in the current year of $228 million consisted of losses of $102 million on euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the anticipated wild flavors acquisition, global headquarters relocation costs of $16 million, toepfer integration and other restructuring charges of $15 million, and pension settlement of $98 million. other charges in the prior year of $147 million consisted of a $54 million provision related to an anti-corruption settlement, losses of $40 million on australian dollar foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the proposed graincorp acquisition, $21 million of costs related to strategic merger and acquisition projects, and $32 million of costs primarily related to asset write-downs and reallocations of costs from the operating segments to corporate. minority interest and other expense increased $47 million primarily due to changes in the elimination of the income attributable to the minority shareholder of toepfer.

net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased $152 million to $692 million.  asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs in the 2012 period decreased $115 million after tax ($206 million pretax).  the 2012 period results also include gains of $49 million after tax related to the company's interest in graincorp and a gain of $24 million after tax related to the sale of certain of the company's exchange membership interests, partially offset by charges of $44 million after tax related to pension settlements.
income taxes increased $66 million due to higher earnings before income taxes.  the effective income tax rate of 30.4% in 2012 compares to the rate of 30.3% in the prior period.
segment operating profit in the 2012 period increased $243 million due to a $318 million improvement in operating results in the oilseeds processing segment, the absence of the prior period asset impairment charges of $339 million in the corn processing segment related primarily to the write-down of assets at its clinton, ia bioplastics facility, and higher results of the company's financial operations of $76 million, in part due to a gain on sale of certain of the company's exchange membership interests and favorable captive insurance loss reserve adjustments.  partially offsetting these improvements were lower results in the 2012 period in corn processing's bioproducts business of $408 million, excluding the clinton, ia asset impairment charge discussed above, and the 2012 period loss of $146 million in the agricultural services segment related to the disposal of gruma.
corporate expenses were $27 million higher in the 2012 period, due primarily to $68 million of pension settlement charges, partially offset by higher returns on the company's equity method investment in cip.

as an agricultural commodity-based business, the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company's operating results.  from a demand perspective, protein meal demand continued to increase, particularly for u.s. domestic and export markets.  demand for soybeans was solid.  weaker u.s. gasoline demand and unfavorable global ethanol trade flows resulted in continued excess industry ethanol capacity.   from a supply perspective, following below-average harvests in the 2011/2012 crop year in north and south america, corn and soybean supplies were tight and commodity market prices were generally higher.  in south america, farmers responded to high crop prices with record soybean plantings for the 2012/2013 crop year.  the lower corn harvest in the u.s. due to the drought led to higher corn prices and higher demand for corn from south america.
revenues increased $1.5 billion to $46.7 billion.  higher average selling prices increased revenues by $4.9 billion, primarily due to increases in underlying commodity prices,  while lower sales volumes, inclusive of the effects of acquisitions, reduced revenues by $2.4 billion.  changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased revenues by $1.0 billion.  oilseeds processing sales increased 4% to $18.1 billion due principally to higher average selling prices of protein meal and soybeans and higher sales volumes of corn, primarily in south america, and protein meal.  corn processing sales decreased 4% to $6.2 billion due principally to lower average selling prices of ethanol.  agricultural services sales increased 5% to $22.4 billion, due to higher average selling prices of soybeans and wheat partially offset by lower sales volumes of corn.
cost of products sold increased $1.6 billion to $44.9 billion due principally to higher prices of agricultural commodities partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and $1.1 billion related to the effects of changing foreign currency rates.  manufacturing expenses decreased $102 million or 3%, due principally to lower energy and repairs and maintenance costs, and savings in employee and benefit-related costs.

selling, general and administrative expenses increased $39 million to $869 million.  included in selling, general, and administrative expenses are pension settlement charges of $68 million for the six months ended december 31, 2012.  excluding these pension settlement charges, selling, general, and administrative expenses declined $29 million or 3% due principally to lower employee and benefit-related costs.
asset impairment charges in the 2012 period represent impairments of $146 million related to the company's divestment of its equity method investments in gruma and gruma-related joint ventures.  the prior year charges relate to the company's clinton, ia bioplastics facility.  property, plant, and equipment were written down to estimated fair value resulting in impairment charges of $320 million.  in addition, charges of $32 million were recognized for exit activities and to impair other assets.
other income increased $97 million to $109 million due primarily to $62 million of gains related to the company's interest in graincorp and $39 million of gains on the sale of certain of the company's exchange membership interests.

oilseeds processing operating profit increased $318 million to $747 million.  crushing and origination operating profit increased $290 million to $517 million as results in north america, europe and south america improved.  the company's u.s. soybean operations delivered strong results, with high seasonal utilization amid good u.s. and export meal demand.  in europe, rapeseed and soybean crushing earnings improved significantly.  in south america, results benefited from improved soybean crushing margins.  refining, packaging, biodiesel, and other results decreased $54 million to $78 million primarily due to weaker european and u.s. biodiesel results.  cocoa and other results increased $93 million as weaker cocoa press margins were offset by the absence of the prior period's net unrealized mark-to-market losses related to certain forward purchase and sales commitments accounted for as derivatives.  asia results decreased $11 million to $87 million principally reflecting the company's share of its results from equity investee, wilmar.
corn processing operating profit increased $17 million to $71 million.  the prior period results include $339 million in asset impairment charges and exit costs related to the company's clinton, ia bioplastics facility.  excluding the bioplastics charges and exit costs, corn processing operating profit declined $322 million.  sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $86 million to $191 million, as tight sweetener industry capacity supported higher average selling prices.  the prior period sweeteners and starches results were negatively impacted by higher net corn costs related to the mark-to-market timing effects of economic hedges.  bioproducts profit decreased $69 million to a $120 million loss.  excluding the $339 million prior year asset impairment charges, bioproducts profit decreased $408 million.  weak domestic gasoline demand and unfavorable global ethanol trade flows resulted in continued excess industry capacity, keeping ethanol margins negative.
agricultural services operating profit, including the 2012 period $146 million gruma asset impairment charge and $62 million gain on the company's interest in graincorp, decreased $168 million to $395 million.  merchandising and handling earnings decreased $16 million mostly due to weaker u.s. merchandising results impacted by the smaller u.s. harvest.  merchandising and handling earnings in the 2012 period include the $62 million gain on the company's interest in graincorp.  earnings from transportation operations decreased $14 million to $67 million due to increased barge operating expenses caused by low water on the mississippi river partially offset by higher freight rates.  milling and other operating profit decreased $138 million to $29 million due principally to a $146 million impairment charge on the disposal of the company's equity method investments in gruma and gruma-related joint ventures.  milling results remained strong, and the company's feed business saw improved margins amid stronger demand.
other financial operating profit increased $76 million to $93 million mainly due to asset disposal gains for certain of the company's exchange membership interests and improved results of the company's captive insurance subsidiary.
corporate expenses increased $27 million to $309 million in the 2012 period.  the company incurred $68 million in pension settlement charges related to a one-time window for lump sum distributions in the u.s. and the conversion of a dutch pension plan to a multi-employer plan.  excluding these pension charges, corporate expenses declined by $41 million.  corporate interest expense - net increased $22 million mostly due to the absence of interest income received in the prior period related to a contingent gain settlement.   unallocated corporate costs were lower by $15 million primarily due to lower employee and employee benefit-related costs.  the increase in other income of $56 million is primarily due to improved equity earnings from corporate affiliate investments.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
year ended june 30, 2012 compared to year ended june 30, 2011
as an agricultural commodity-based business, the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company's operating results.  from a demand perspective, global protein meal consumption has continued to grow although at a slower rate.  excess industry crushing production capacity has pressured oilseeds margins, and the company has adjusted production rates regionally to balance supply with current market demand.  biodiesel markets supported global demand for refined and crude vegetable oils.  in the u.s., high biodiesel inventories associated with the december 31, 2011, expiration of blender's incentives dampened margins in the second half of the fiscal year.  u.s. corn sweetener exports continue to support sales volumes and margins.  ethanol sales volumes were supported by favorable gasoline blending economics in the u.s.  however, excess industry production of ethanol, together with recently reduced u.s. ethanol export demand, has negatively impacted ethanol margins.  from a supply perspective, crop supplies in certain key growing regions at the beginning of fiscal 2012, including south america and the black sea region, were adequate, but a smaller-than-normal harvest in north america in the fall of 2011 resulted in low u.s. carryover stocks for corn and soybeans.  because of the smaller than expected south american harvest, global supplies of corn and soybeans were more dependent on the north american harvest.  while plantings of corn increased in the u.s. during fiscal 2012, the drought conditions late in the fiscal year decreased expectations for the size of the harvest.  these factors, combined with concerns about the european debt situation and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, contributed to volatile commodity market price movements during fiscal 2012.
net earnings attributable to controlling interests decreased $0.8 billion to $1.2 billion.  segment operating profit declined $1.6 billion to $2.5 billion amid more challenging conditions generally affecting all reportable segments.  segment operating profit in fiscal 2012 included $349 million of asset impairment charges and exit costs comprised of $335 million to exit the company's clinton, ia, bioplastics plant and $14 million to shut down its walhalla, nd, ethanol dry mill.  earnings before income taxes included a credit of $10 million from the effect on lifo inventory valuation reserves, including the liquidation of lifo inventory layers, partially offset by increasing agricultural commodity prices, compared to charges of $368 million in the prior year.  fiscal 2012 unallocated corporate expenses included $71 million of charges related to the company's global workforce reduction program.
income taxes decreased $0.5 billion due to lower earnings before income taxes and a lower effective income tax rate.  the company's effective income tax rate declined to 29.6% compared to 33.1% in the prior year primarily due to income tax benefits associated with foreign currency re-measurement of non-monetary assets partially offset by a geographic mix of earnings that shifted more to foreign jurisdictions.

revenues increased $7.0 billion due to higher average selling prices, primarily related to higher underlying commodity prices, and $2.1 billion due to increased sales volumes, including sales volumes from acquisitions, partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $0.7 billion.  the increase in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant increase in margins or gross profit as higher underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on cost of products sold. oilseeds processing sales increased 16% to $34.7 billion due principally to higher average selling prices of vegetable oils, merchandised commodities, protein meal, and biodiesel and increased sales volumes of biodiesel, protein meal, and peanuts, in part due to the acquisition of golden peanut in december 2010.  corn processing sales increased 22% to $12.1 billion due principally to higher average selling prices of ethanol and sweeteners as well as higher sales volumes of sugar and ethanol.  agricultural services sales increased 3% to $42.1 billion, due to higher average selling prices of corn and wheat flour partially offset by lower sales volumes, in part due to lower export volumes from the u.s.
cost of products sold increased 12% to $85.4 billion due principally to higher prices of agricultural commodities and, to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes.  changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced fiscal 2012 cost of products sold by $0.7 billion.  manufacturing expenses increased $0.2 billion due to higher costs for maintenance, employee and benefit-related expenses, energy, and chemicals.  these higher costs were primarily due to higher production volumes, acquisitions, and higher unit costs for fuels and certain chemicals.  partially offsetting these higher costs was lower depreciation expense, in part due to the company's change in estimated service lives for machinery and equipment during the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
selling, general, and administrative expenses remained steady at $1.6 billion.  loss provisions mainly due to an unfavorable arbitration award in the company's agricultural services operating segment were partially offset by lower overhead expenses.
asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs of $449 million were comprised of $349 million in the corn processing segment related to the company's exit from its clinton, ia, bioplastics business and ethanol dry mill in walhalla, nd, $71 million in corporate for the global workforce reduction, and $29 million in corporate for investment write-downs and other facility exit-related costs.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
interest expense decreased 9% to $441 million primarily due to lower long-term debt balances, higher interest expense capitalized on construction projects in progress, and lower interest expense related to uncertain income tax positions.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased 13% to $472 million principally due to decreased equity earnings from the company's equity investee, gruma, which included a $78 million gain in the prior year related to gruma's disposal of certain assets.
interest income declined 18% to $112 million primarily related to the sale and deconsolidation of the hickory point bank and trust company, fsb, effective september 30, 2011.
other income - net declined $101 million to $17 million due primarily to the absence of income recognized in the prior year period of $71 million for the golden peanut gain and $30 million for gains on interest rate swaps.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
oilseeds processing operating profit decreased $0.4 billion to $1.3 billion.  crushing and origination operating profit decreased $284 million to $641 million primarily due to weaker results in european softseeds, lower results in north american softseeds, and lower north american positioning results.  partially offsetting these lower results, were higher grain origination results in south america driven by higher volumes and favorable positioning.  poor european softseed results were driven by a small prior year rapeseed crop, positioning losses, and weaker demand for protein meal and oils.  north american softseed results declined primarily as a result of lower margins generated from a tight cottonseed supply.    refining, packaging, biodiesel, and other results declined $47 million to $295 million due primarily to declines in biodiesel margins in south america and europe and lower margins for specialty fats and oils in europe. these declines were partially offset by improved north american protein specialties and natural health and nutrition results due to higher margins and volumes.  cocoa and other results declined $57 million to $183 million.  fiscal 2012 results in cocoa and other were reduced by $100 million for net unrealized mark-to-market losses related to certain forward purchase and sales commitments accounted for as derivatives.  the prior year included $9 million of net unrealized mark-to-market losses.  excluding these timing effects, cocoa results improved in fiscal 2012 driven by improved press margins caused by strong cocoa powder demand.  the prior year included the $71 million golden peanut gain which was partially offset in fiscal 2012 by higher earnings in the company's peanut business in part due to the first full year of consolidated results for golden peanut being reported by the company in fiscal 2012.  asia results remained steady at $183 million, principally reflecting the company's share of its results from equity investee, wilmar.
corn processing operating results decreased $818 million to $261 million due principally to poor ethanol margins and $349 million in asset impairment charges and exit costs.  excluding the asset impairment and exit costs related to the company's bioplastics business and walhalla, nd, ethanol dry grind facility, corn processing operating profit of $610 million in fiscal 2012 represented a decline of $469 million compared to the prior year.  processed volumes were up 5 percent while net corn costs increased compared to the prior year.  sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $5 million to $335 million, as higher average selling prices more than offset higher net corn costs.   bioproducts profit decreased $823 million to a loss of $74 million, including the $349 million asset impairment and exit charges.  lower ethanol margins were caused by excess supply as previously offline production restarted while industry demand declined, in part due to slowing export demand.  prior year bioproducts results were enhanced by favorable corn ownership positions, which lowered net corn costs in that period.  bioproducts results in the prior year were negatively impacted by startup costs of $94 million related to the company's new dry-grind ethanol, bioplastics, and glycol plants.
agricultural services operating profits decreased $376 million to $947 million.  merchandising and handling earnings decreased primarily due to lower results from u.s. operations.  lower sales volumes were principally the result of the relatively higher cost of u.s. grains and oilseeds in the global market due to lower stocks caused by a smaller u.s. harvest in 2011.  this relatively weaker position led to reduced u.s. grain exports.  in the prior year, merchandising and handling results were positively impacted by higher quantities of u.s. grain exports by the company.  in addition, fiscal 2012 included $40 million of increased loss provisions mainly due to an unfavorable arbitration award.  earnings from transportation were steady.  prior year's operating results in milling and other operations included a $78 million gain related to gruma's disposal of certain assets.
other financial operating profit decreased $24 million to $15 million mainly due to higher loss provisions at the company's captive insurance subsidiary related to property and crop risk reserves.
corporate expenses declined $356 million to $760 million in fiscal 2012.  the effects of a liquidation of lifo inventory layers partially offset by increasing commodity prices on lifo inventory valuations resulted in a credit of $10 million in fiscal 2012 compared to a charge of $368 million in the prior year primarily due to higher prices.  corporate interest expense decreased $22 million primarily due to lower interest expense on lower long-term debt balances.  unallocated corporate costs include $71 million of costs related to the global workforce reduction program.  excluding these costs, unallocated corporate costs declined $37 million due primarily to lower administrative costs.  corporate other income increased due to higher investment income partially offset by $29 million for investment writedown and facility exit-related costs. also, in the prior year the company recognized $30 million of gains on interest rate swaps.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
liquidity and capital resources a company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business.  the company's strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops that it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, and expanding its value-added product portfolio. the company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of the company's control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures. the primary source of funds to finance the company's operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility.  in addition, the company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both u.s. and international markets.
cash provided by operating activities was $5.0 billion for 2014 compared to $5.2 billion in 2013. working capital changes increased cash by $2.3 billion in the current year and by $2.9 billion in the prior year. inventories declined approximately $1.3 billion at december 31, 2014 compared to december 31, 2013 due to lower prices. cash used in investing activities was $3.4 billion this year compared to $0.6 billion last year primarily due to capital expenditures and net assets of businesses acquired of $3.7 billion this year compared to $1.0 billion last year. cash used in financing activities was $3.6 billion this year compared to $3.2 billion last year. in the current period, long-term debt payments increased as the $1.15 billion convertible debt matured in february 2014 and was paid with available cash.
at december 31, 2014, the company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.7 to 1.  included in working capital is $5.9 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories.  at december 31, 2014, the company's capital resources included shareholders' equity of $19.6 billion and lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion which was unused.  the company's ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt and shareholders' equity) was 22% at december 31, 2014 and 21% at december 31, 2013.  the company uses this ratio as a measure of the company's long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility.  the company's ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, and long-term debt less the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities) to capital (the sum of net debt and shareholders' equity) was 17% at december 31, 2014 and 14% at december 31, 2013.  of the company's total lines of credit, $4.0 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there was no commercial paper outstanding at december 31, 2014.
as of december 31, 2014, the company had $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $0.5 billion of which is cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. based on the company's historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its u.s. operations and unused and available u.s. credit capacity of $4.0 billion, the company has asserted that these funds are permanently reinvested outside the u.s.
the company has accounts receivable securitization programs ( the "programs") with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. the programs provide the company with up to $1.6 billion in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the programs and expands the company's access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see note 20 in item 8 for more information and disclosures on the programs). as of december 31, 2014, the company utilized $1.6 billion of its facility under the programs.
on november 5, 2009, the company's board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to 100,000,000 shares of the company's common stock during the period commencing january 1, 2010 and ending december 31, 2014.  the company has acquired approximately 59.8 million shares under this program, including 25.4 million shares acquired in 2014. on november 5, 2014, the company's board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to 100,000,000 shares of the company's common stock during the period commencing january 1, 2015 and ending december 31, 2019.
the company expects capital expenditures of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion during 2015. in 2015, the company expects an additional cash outlay of approximately $0.7 billion in dividends and $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion in share repurchases target, subject to strategic capital requirements.
the company's credit facilities and certain debentures require the company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements.  the company is in compliance with these covenants as of december 31, 2014.

(1) includes pension contributions of $38 million for fiscal 2015.  the company is unable to estimate the amount of pension contributions beyond fiscal year 2015.  for more information concerning the company's pension and other postretirement plans, see note 15 in item 8.
at december 31, 2014, the company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion through fiscal year 2019 to complete currently approved capital projects which are not included in the table above.
the company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $980 million at december 31, 2014.
the company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity-method investees, which could obligate the company to make future payments.  the company's liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation.  the company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations.  at december 31, 2014, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $27 million.

off balance sheet arrangements accounts receivable securitization programs since march 2012, the company has an accounts receivable securitization program (the "program") with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the "purchasers").  under the program, certain u.s.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, adm receivables, llc ("adm receivables").  adm receivables in turn transfers such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement.  in exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, adm receivables receives a cash payment of up to $1.2 billion, as amended, billion and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration). the program terminates on june 26, 2015, unless extended.
in march 2014, the company entered into a second accounts receivable securitization program (the "second program") with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the "second purchasers"). under the second program, certain non-u.s.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, adm ireland receivables company ("adm ireland receivables"). adm ireland receivables in turn transfers such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the second purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement. in exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, adm ireland receivables receives a cash payment of up to $0.4 billion and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration). the second program terminates on march 20, 2015, unless extended.
under the program and second program (collectively, the "programs"), adm receivables and adm ireland receivables use the cash proceeds from the transfer of receivables to the purchasers and second purchasers and other consideration to finance the purchase of receivables from the company and the adm subsidiaries originating the receivables.
the company accounts for these transfers as sales.  the company has no retained interests in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and its right to the deferred consideration.  at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the company did not record a servicing asset or liability related to its retained responsibility, based on its assessment of the servicing fee, market values for similar transactions and its cost of servicing the receivables sold.
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the fair value of trade receivables transferred to the purchasers and second purchasers under the programs and derecognized from the company's consolidated balance sheet was $2.1 billion, and $1.9 billion, respectively. in exchange for the transfer, as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the company received cash of $1.6 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, and recorded a receivable for deferred consideration included in other current assets of $0.5 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively. cash collections from customers on receivables sold were $36.4 billion, $39.8 billion, $21.9 billion, and $8.9 billion for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, the six months ended december 31, 2012, and the year ended june 30, 2012, respectively. of this amount, $35.1 billion, $39.8 billion, $21.9 billion, and $8.9 billion pertain to cash collections on the deferred consideration for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, the six months ended december 31, 2012 and the year ended june 30, 2012, respectively. deferred consideration is paid to the company in cash on behalf of the purchasers and second purchasers as receivables are collected; however, as these are revolving facilities, cash collected from the company's customers is reinvested by the purchasers and second purchasers daily in new receivable purchases under the programs.
the company's risk of loss following the transfer of accounts receivable under the program is limited to the deferred consideration outstanding.  the company carries the deferred consideration at fair value determined by calculating the expected amount of cash to be received and is principally based on observable inputs (a level 2 measurement under applicable accounting standards) consisting mainly of the face amount of the receivables adjusted for anticipated credit losses and discounted at the appropriate market rate.  payment of deferred consideration is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on accounts receivable transferred under the program which have historically been insignificant.
transfers of receivables under the program during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, the six months ended december 31, 2012, and the year ended june 30, 2012, resulted in an expense for the loss on sale of $5 million, $4 million, $4 million, and $4 million, respectively, which is classified as selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the company reflects all cash flows related to the program as operating activities in its consolidated statement of cash flows because the cash received from the purchasers upon both the sale and collection of the receivables is not subject to significant interest rate risk given the short-term nature of the company's trade receivables.
synthetic leasing program the company is a party to lease agreements under synthetic leasing programs for certain of its u.s. barge and trucking assets for periods ranging from 5 to 7 years. as of december 31, 2014, outstanding lease balances, including the value of the underlying assets of $143 million, were off-balance sheet. these agreements provide the company with the right to use these assets for specified periods in exchange for an obligation to make rental payments. the agreements are accounted for as operating leases, such that the rent expense is recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings. the future lease payments pertaining to these lease agreements are included in the contractual obligations table in item 7. these leasing programs are utilized primarily to diversify funding sources and to retain flexibility. the company recorded $5 million and $3 million of rent expense pertaining to synthetic lease payments for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013.
critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the company's assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses.  these estimates and judgments are based on the company's historical experience and management's knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  certain of the company's accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the company's financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management.  management has discussed with the company's audit committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies.  following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the company's financial statements.
fair value measurements - inventories and commodity derivatives certain of the company's inventory and commodity derivative assets and liabilities as of december 31, 2014 are valued at estimated fair values, including $4.7 billion of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, $0.9 billion of derivative assets, $0.9 billion of derivative liabilities, and $0.7 billion of inventory-related payables.  commodity derivative assets and liabilities include forward fixed-price purchase and sale contracts for agricultural commodities. merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing.  management estimates fair value for its commodity-related assets and liabilities based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets.  the company's inventory and derivative commodity fair value measurements are mainly based on observable market quotations without significant adjustments and are therefore reported as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  level 3 fair value measurements of approximately $1.7 billion of assets and $0.3 billion of liabilities represent fair value estimates where unobservable price components represent 10% or more of the total fair value price.  for more information concerning amounts reported as level 3, see note 3 in item 8.  changes in the market values of these inventories and commodity contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  if management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.  additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.
derivatives - designated hedging activities the company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the company's anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol.  these designated hedging programs principally relate to the company's corn processing operating segment.  assuming normal market conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.  if it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts would be recorded immediately in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  see note 4 in item 8 for additional information.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
investments in affiliates the company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence, including its 17.3% investment in wilmar.  these investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  generally, the minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20% ownership of the investee.  however, the company considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including but not limited to, ownership percentage, board membership, customer and vendor relationships, and other arrangements.  if management used a different accounting method for these investments, then the amount of earnings from affiliates the company recognizes may materially differ.
income taxes the company accounts for its income tax positions in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. these standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements. the company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. the company frequently faces challenges from u.s. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.  these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the company.  for example, the company has received tax assessments from tax authorities in brazil and argentina challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the company.  the company evaluated its tax positions for these matters and concluded, based in part upon advice from legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize the tax benefits of these positions (see note 13 in item 8 for additional information).
deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the company's income statement.  the realization of the company's deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.  the company evaluates all available positive and negative evidence including estimated future reversals of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results. valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not likely. during 2014, the company increased valuation allowances by approximately $18 million primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards. to the extent the company were to favorably resolve matters for which valuation allowances have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned valuation allowances, the company's effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted.
undistributed earnings of the company's foreign subsidiaries and the company's share of the undistributed earnings of affiliated corporate joint venture companies accounted for on the equity method amounting to approximately $8.6 billion at december 31, 2014, are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for u.s. income taxes has been provided thereon.  if the company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the company could be subject to u.s. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
property, plant, and equipment and asset abandonments and write-downs the company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  this business is global in nature and is highly capital-intensive.  both the availability of the company's raw materials and the demand for the company's finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  these aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the company's raw materials and finished products.  any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the company's assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its facilities.  the company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value-added products produced from agricultural commodities and products.  these new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective.  management evaluates the company's property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.  assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.  if management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.  during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, the six months ended december 31, 2012 and 2011, and the year ended june 30, 2012, impairment charges for property, plant, and equipment were $35 million, $84 million, $0 million, $337 million, and $367 million, respectively (see note 19 in item 8 for additional information).
business combinations the company's acquisitions are accounted for as purchases in accordance with asc topic 805, business combinations, as amended. assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on preliminary purchase price allocations , are adjusted to fair values at acquisition date with the remainder of the purchase price, if any, recorded as goodwill. when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows and discount rates. although management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, actual results may differ.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on october 1 or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows and discount rates. as of december 31, 2014, no impairment of goodwill has been identified. for fiscal years ended on june 30, 2012 and prior, the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on april 1 (see note 1 in item 8 for additional information regarding this change in accounting policy).  definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 2 to 25 years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  if management used different estimates and assumptions in its impairment tests, then the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.
employee benefit plans the company provides substantially all u.s. employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with retirement benefits including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans.  the company provides eligible u.s. employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are "grandfathered" into subsidized coverage while others are provided with health care reimbursement accounts).  in order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs.  these estimates and assumptions are based on the company's historical experience combined with management's knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  management also uses third-party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans.  if management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.  at december 31, 2014, a new mortality table was used to estimate anticipated mortality rates that contributed to an increase in projected benefit obligations of approximately $0.2 billion. see note 15 in item 8 for additional information.

in 2014, the companys sales reached $2 billion, which represented an increase of 4% as compared to 2013. overall, 2014 sales benefited from strong demand from the companys pharmaceutical customers. this strength was broad-based and drove mid-single digit sales growth in the u.s. and europe and 18% sales growth in india. conversely, the companys 2014 sales were affected by a slower pace of business in china and the negative effect of foreign currency translation, primarily caused by the weakening japanese yen.
combined sales of chemistry consumables and services increased 7% and 4% in 2014 and 2013, respectively, as a result of a larger installed base of customers and higher billing demand. instrument system sales increased 3% and 2% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. in 2014, instrument systems sales grew due to higher demand for lc and lc-ms instrument system sales. instrument systems sales grew in 2013 as a result of increased demand in high-end mass spectrometry, core chromatography and ta instrument systems. in addition, instrument system sales benefited in 2014 and 2013 from the introductions of the acquity® qda® detector in late 2013, acquity® upc2®  system and the acquity® advanced polymer chromatography® (apctm) system. acquisitions had a minimal impact on sales growth in both 2014 and 2013. the effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2% across all products and services in both 2014 and 2013. based on current foreign exchange rates, the company expects that foreign currency translation may have a significant negative effect on sales in 2015.
sales to pharmaceutical customers grew 8% and 1% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. sales growth to pharmaceutical customers in 2014 was positive in all regions, except japan, where sales to pharmaceutical customers were flat due to the negative effects of foreign currency translation. combined global sales to governmental and academic customers increased 4% and 8% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. combined sales to industrial chemical, nutritional safety and environmental customers decreased 1% in 2014 and increased 6% in
22
2013. the decline in sales to industrial chemical, nutritional safety and environmental customers in 2014 is primarily due to weaker industrial chemical customer demand for both waters division and ta division instrument systems.
operating income was flat in 2014 as compared to 2013 as the increase in sales volume was offset by the negative effects of foreign currency translation, which decreased 2014 operating profit by approximately $22 million. during 2014, the company incurred a $15 million charge for acquired in-process research and development related to the licensing of certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized and significantly related to new, medically-focused applications, as well as other applications. in addition, 2014 included $6 million of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce and a $5 million impairment charge related to a write-down in the fair value of a building held for sale in the u.k. these expenses were offset slightly by a $2 million award received in 2014 from an arbitration settlement.
the 1% increase in operating income in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to the increase in sales volume offset by the negative effects of foreign currency translation, which decreased 2013 operating profit by approximately $27 million, and the increase in amortization expense from the unifi® software. in addition, the comparability of 2013 operating income with 2012 operating income was impacted by the 2012 one-time litigation provisions and purchased intangible amortization expense related to the discontinuance of a product trade name intangible asset.
net income per diluted share was primarily affected by the following factors in 2014, 2013 and 2012:
   foreign currency translation decreased net income per diluted share by $0.23 in 2014, $0.27 in 2013 and $0.14 in 2012.

                                               in 2014, the company incurred an acquired in-process research and development charge of $15 million, which decreased net income per diluted share by
$0.14. in addition, net income per diluted share decreased $0.04 due to severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce and $0.04 due to a $5 million impairment charge related to a building held for sale in the u.k.

                            in 2013, the company recorded a $31 million net tax benefit related to the completion of tax audit examinations. in addition, a $3 million benefit related to the research and development tax credit (r&amp;d tax credit) for the 2012 tax year was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. these tax benefits added $0.39 per diluted share in 2013.

                                                 in 2012, the company refinanced certain of its inter-company debt arrangements, which enabled the company to record a $36 million tax benefit related to the recognition of a deferred tax asset associated with a non-u.s. net operating loss carryforward. in 2012, the company also recorded a $6 million tax benefit related to tax audit settlements in the u.s. these tax benefits added $0.48 per diluted share in 2012.

                                              the effect of lower weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from the companys share repurchase program, offset by the incremental net interest expense on borrowings to repurchase those shares, increased net income per diluted share $0.07, $0.11 and $0.14 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the company plans to continue its share repurchase program in 2015.

net cash provided by operating activities was $512 million, $485 million and $449 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the $27 million increase in operating cash flow in 2014 when compared to 2013 was primarily a result of the timing of cash receipts from customers, which improved days-sales-outstanding (dso) by 1 day at december 31, 2014 as compared to december 31, 2013, and the timing of payments to vendors. the $36 million increase in operating cash flow in 2013 when compared to 2012 was primarily a result of the timing of cash receipts from customers and the timing of payments to vendors.
within cash flows used in investing activities, capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization were $91 million, $118 million and $105 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. capital expenditures in 2013 and 2012 include multi-year construction projects to accommodate future growth.
23
the construction of the new $83 million research, manufacturing and distribution facility in wilmslow, england was completed in early 2014. during 2014, the company made payments of $15 million to acquire and license intellectual property.
in july 2014, the company acquired the net assets of medimass research, development and service kft. (medimass), a developer of mass spectrometry-related technologies with the potential to be used for a variety of applications, for $23 million in cash. in addition, the company acquired ulsp b.v. in january 2014 for $4 million in cash. these acquisitions are not expected to have significant sales in 2015 and the company expects to incur additional costs related to commercializing new mass spectrometry-related technologies in 2015 and beyond. in 2013, the company acquired scarabaeus mess-und prodktionstechnik gmbh, nonlinear dynamics ltd., expert systems solutions s.r.l. and lasercomp inc. for a total of $41 million, net of cash acquired. in 2012, the company acquired its israeli sales and service distributor, baehr thermoanalyse gmbh and blue reference, inc. for a total of $31 million, net of cash acquired and including the assumption of $1 million of debt. the company continues to evaluate the acquisition of businesses, product lines and technologies to augment the waters and ta operating divisions.
within cash flows used in financing activities, the company issued and sold senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $200 million in june 2014. the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes were used to repay outstanding portions of the revolving facility. in february 2015, the company repaid $100 million of senior unsecured notes upon maturity with borrowings under the revolving facility. in may 2014, the companys board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $750 million of its outstanding common stock over a three-year period and authorized the extension of the may 2012 program until may 2015. during 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company repurchased $329 million, $295 million and $290 million of the companys outstanding common stock, respectively, under the may 2012 authorization and other previously announced programs. the company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the companys sales and profits. in addition, the company received $74 million, $69 million and $29 million of proceeds from stock plans in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. fluctuations in these amounts were primarily attributable to changes in the companys stock price and the expiration of stock option grants.

in 2014, the u.s. sales growth was driven by an increase in lc and lc-ms instrument system sales and service sales to pharmaceutical, governmental and academic customers. europes sales in 2014 were driven by lc, lc-ms and ta instrument system sales and service sales across all customer classes. chinas sales decline in 2014 can be primarily attributed to lower research-focused, higher priced instrument sales to governmentally funded customers that experienced a tightening of government spending. japans 2014 sales were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation, which decreased sales in 2014 by 8%. the increase in sales in the rest of asia in 2014 was driven by an increase in lc and lc-ms instrument system sales and service sales to pharmaceutical, governmental and academic customers, primarily in india. sales in the rest of the world in 2014 were flat as increased service sales to pharmaceutical, governmental and academic customers were offset by weakness in other areas.
in 2013, sales increased in all major regions on stronger customer demand for instrument systems, except for japan, where the effect of foreign currency translation decreased sales 18%. the increase in sales in the u.s. in 2013 was driven by industrial and environmental customers, while the increase in europe was driven by governmental and academic customers. chinas 2013 sales growth was broad-based across all product and customer classes, while sales in the rest of asia were flat. the increase in the rest of the worlds sales in 2013 was broad-based across all product and customer classes.

waters instrument system sales (lc and ms technology-based) increased 4% and 1% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in 2014 instrument systems sales is primarily attributable to higher sales of lc and lc-ms instrument system sales. the increase in 2013 is primarily attributable to higher sales of uplc®-mass spectrometry systems, driven by xevo® and synapt® instrument systems. in addition, instrument system sales benefited in 2014 and 2013 from the introductions of the new acquity qda detector, acquity upc2 system and acquity apc system. chemistry consumables sales increased in both 2014 and 2013 on the uptake in acquity columns, including the new cortecs® columns introduced in 2013. waters division service sales increased in both 2014 and 2013 due to increased sales of service plans and higher service demand billings to a higher installed base of customers. the effect of foreign currency translation decreased waters division sales across all products and services by 1% and 2% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the impact of the acquisitions of medimass in 2014 and nonlinear dynamics in 2013 was not significant to the waters division sales in 2014.
in 2014, waters division sales increased 8% in the u.s., 5% in europe, 4% in asia and 1% in the rest of the world. the increase in sales in the u.s. in 2014 was primarily driven by sales to pharmaceutical, governmental and academic customers. waters division sales in china increased 1% in 2014, but decreased 4% in japan due to the effects of foreign currency translation. waters division sales in the rest of asia increased 13% and were driven by sales to pharmaceutical customers in india as well as governmental and academic customers.
25
in 2013, waters division sales increased 4% in both the u.s. and europe, while sales decreased 2% in asia and increased 12% in the rest of the world. waters division sales in china increased 13% in 2013 across all product and customer classes. the 2013 growth in china was offset by an 18% decrease in sales in japan, which was largely due to a 22% weakening of the japanese yen as compared to the u.s. dollar. the increase in waters division sales in the rest of the world was broad-based across most product and customer classes.

the decrease in ta instrument system sales in 2014 was primarily attributable to lower customer demand for tas core thermal analysis instrument systems in comparison to stronger sales in 2013. the increase in ta instrument system sales in 2013 was primarily a result of higher demand for instrument systems from tas industrial customers, as well as revenue associated with the shipment of the new discovery instrument systems. ta service sales increased in both 2014 and 2013 due to sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. the effect of foreign currency translation decreased tas sales by 1% in both 2014 and 2013. recent acquisitions added approximately 3% to tas sales in 2014 and 1% in 2013. tas 2014 sales increased moderately in the u.s. and europe but declined in most other regions. tas 2013 sales increased in each territory, except for japan, where the effects of foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales due to the weakening of the japanese yen as compared to the u.s. dollar.
gross profit gross profit increased 4% in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due increased sales volumes which were somewhat offset by negative foreign currency translation. gross profit increased 1% in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to changes in the product mix of instrument systems and higher manufacturing leverage from higher sales volumes being offset by the negative effects of foreign currency translation and the increase in amortization expense from new software platforms. gross profit as a percentage of sales was 58.5%, 58.9% and 60.0% for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
gross profit as a percentage of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, price, product costs of instrument systems and amortization software platforms. the company also expects that the impact of foreign currency translation may negatively affect gross profit in 2015, based on current exchange rates.
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased 4% in 2014 and increased 3% in 2013. selling and administrative expenses in 2014 included $6 million of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce and a $5 million impairment charge related to a write-down in the fair value of a building held for sale in the u.k. these expenses were offset slightly by a $2 million award received in 2014 from an arbitration settlement. selling and administrative expenses in 2013 were impacted by headcount additions and higher merit compensation, offset slightly by favorable foreign currency translation due to the weakness in the japanese yen. as a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 25.8%, 25.9% and 25.9% for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
26
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased 7% and 5% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. research and development expenses in both 2014 and 2013 were impacted by additional headcount, timing of development costs incurred on new products and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation in 2014.
acquired in-process research and development during 2014, the company incurred a $15 million charge for acquired in-process research and development related to the licensing of certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized and for which there was no future alternative use as of the acquisition date. these licensing arrangements are significantly related to new, medically-focused applications, as well as other applications, and require the company to make additional payments of up to $15 million if certain milestones are achieved, as well as royalties on future net sales. these future payments may be significant, but are not expected to be made in 2015 and are most likely to begin after 2016 and occur over multiple years.
purchased intangibles amortization in 2012, the company incurred a one-time $4 million charge to purchased intangibles amortization expense related to the discontinuance of a product trade name intangible asset.
litigation provision the company recorded $7 million of litigation provisions in 2012 for damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection with complaints filed against the company relating to patent infringement lawsuits. the company paid $3 million of these litigation provisions in 2012.
other expense the company recorded a $2 million charge in 2013 for an other-than-temporary impairment to an investment.
interest expense, net the increases in net interest expense in 2014 and 2013 were primarily attributable to an increase in average borrowings.
provision for income taxes the four principal jurisdictions in which the company manufactures are the u.s., ireland, the united kingdom and singapore, where the marginal effective tax rates were approximately 37.5%, 12.5%, 21.5% and 0%, respectively, as of december 31, 2014. the company has a contractual tax rate in singapore of 0% through march 2016, based upon achievement of contractual milestones that the company expects to continue to meet. the current statutory tax rate in singapore is 17%. the companys effective tax rate is influenced by many significant factors, including, but not limited to, the wide range of income tax rates in jurisdictions in which the company operates; sales volumes and profit levels in each tax jurisdiction; changes in tax laws, tax rates and policies; the outcome of various ongoing tax audit examinations; and the impact of foreign currency transactions and translation. as a result of variability in these factors, the companys effective tax rates in the future may not be similar to the effective tax rates for the current or prior year.
the companys effective tax rates were 12.0%, 8.2% and 5.4% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the income tax provision for 2013 included a $31 million net tax benefit related to the completion of tax audit examinations. in addition, the r&d tax credit was retroactively extended in january 2013 for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. the entire $3 million benefit related to the 2012 tax year was recorded in the first quarter of 2013, and the 2013 benefit was included in the 2013 annual effective tax rate. the net income tax benefits related to the completed tax audit examinations and the 2012 r&d tax credit decreased the companys effective tax rate by 6.9 percentage points in 2013. the income tax provision for 2012 included a $36 million tax benefit related to the companys refinancing of certain of its inter-company debt arrangements, which enabled the
27
company to recognize a deferred tax asset associated with a non-u.s. net operating loss carryforward. in 2012, the company also recorded a $6 million tax benefit related to tax audit settlements in the u.s. these tax benefits decreased the companys effective tax rate by 8.6 percentage points in 2012. the remaining differences between the effective tax rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were primarily attributable to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates.

29
in june 2013, the company entered into a credit agreement (the 2013 credit agreement) that provides for a $1.1 billion revolving facility and a $300 million term loan facility. the revolving facility and term loan facility both mature on june 25, 2018 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date.
the interest rates applicable to the 2013 credit agreement are, at the companys option, equal to either the alternate base rate calculated daily (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus 1/2% per annum, or (c) the adjusted libo rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in u.s. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 2, 3 or 6 month adjusted libo rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the companys leverage ratio, which can range between 0 to 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 75 basis points and 112.5 basis points for adjusted libo rate loans. the facility fee on the 2013 credit agreement ranges between 12.5 basis points and 25 basis points. the 2013 credit agreement requires that the company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. in addition, the 2013 credit agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities.
during 2014, 2013 and 2012, the companys net debt borrowings increased by $142 million, $146 million and $186 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, the company had a total of $1,465 million in outstanding debt, which consisted of $600 million in outstanding senior unsecured notes, $300 million borrowed under a term loan facility under the 2013 credit agreement, $565 million borrowed under revolving credit facility under the 2013 credit agreement and less than $1 million borrowed under various other short-term lines of credit. at december 31, 2014, $125 million of the outstanding portion of the revolving facility were classified as short-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet due to the fact that the company expects to utilize this portion of the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs within the next twelve months and can repay and re-borrow from the facility without penalty. the remaining $440 million of the outstanding portion of the revolving facility were classified as long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, as no repayments are required prior to the maturity date in 2018 and this portion is not expected to be repaid within the next twelve months. as of december 31, 2014, the company had a total amount available to borrow under existing credit agreements of $533 million after outstanding letters of credit. as of december 31, 2014, the company was in compliance with all debt covenants.
in may 2014, the companys board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $750 million of its outstanding common stock over a three-year period and authorized the extension of the may 2012 program until may 2015. during 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company repurchased 3.1 million, 3.1 million and 3.5 million shares at a cost of $329 million, $295 million and $290 million, respectively, under the may 2012 authorization and other previously announced programs. as of december 31, 2014, the company repurchased an aggregate of 7.4 million shares at a cost of $731 million under the may 2012 repurchase program, leaving a total of $769 million authorized for future repurchases. in addition, the company repurchased $8 million, $6 million and $6 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during each of the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
the company received $74 million, $69 million and $29 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the companys employee stock purchase plan in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $2,055 million as of december 31, 2014. the majority of the companys cash, cash equivalents and investments are generated from foreign operations, with $1,971 million held by foreign subsidiaries at december 31, 2014. due to the fact that most of the companys cash, cash equivalents and investments are held outside of the u.s., the company must manage and maintain sufficient levels of cash flow in the u.s. to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt interest,
30
finance potential u.s. acquisitions and continue the authorized stock repurchase program in the u.s. these u.s. cash requirements are managed by the companys cash flow from u.s. operations and the use of the companys revolving credit facility.
management believes, as of the date of this report, that its financial position, particularly in the u.s., along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions. in addition, there have been no recent significant changes to the companys financial position, nor are there any anticipated changes, to warrant a material adjustment related to indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings.

(1)   does not include normal purchases made in the ordinary course of business and uncertain tax positions discussed below.

the interest rates applicable to the 2013 credit agreement are, at the companys option, equal to either the alternate base rate calculated daily (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus 1/2% per annum, or (c) the adjusted libo rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in u.s. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 2, 3 or 6 month adjusted libo rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the companys leverage ratio, which can range between 0 to 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 75 basis points and 112.5 basis points for adjusted libo rate loans. the facility fee on the 2013 credit agreement ranges between 12.5 basis points and 25 basis points. the 2013 credit agreement requires that the company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. in addition, the 2013 credit agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. as of december 31, 2014, the company was in compliance with all such covenants.

from time to time, the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. the company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and believes any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the companys financial position or results of operations.
the company has long-term liabilities for deferred employee compensation, including pension and supplemental executive retirement plans. the payments related to the supplemental retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the company and whether the employee elects lump-sum or annuity payments. during fiscal year 2015, the company expects to contribute approximately $4 million to $11 million to the companys defined benefit plans.
the company has contingent consideration for an earnout pertaining to the medimass acquisition. the earnout payments are not included above since they are dependent upon many factors that cannot be predicted with any certainty. the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration as of december 31, 2014 is $4 million.
the company licenses certain technology and software from third parties. future minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements as of december 31, 2014 are immaterial. the company enters into licensing arrangements with third parties that require future milestone or royalty payments contingent upon future events. upon the achievement of certain milestones in existing agreements, the company could make additional payments of up to $15 million, as well as royalties on future net sales. it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. as a result, these potential payments are not included in the table above.
the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money. if all of the companys unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of december 31, 2014 were to become recognizable in the future, the company would record a total reduction of approximately $20 million in its income tax provision.
with limited exceptions, the company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before december 31, 2009. however, carryforward attributes that were generated in years beginning on or before january 1, 2010 may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities if the attributes are utilized. the company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, the company concluded tax audit disputes with tax authorities in the u.s. and japan that were related to matters for which the company had previously recorded uncertain tax benefits of approximately $35 million. the resolution of these tax audit disputes also entailed net global assessments against the company of approximately $4 million. accordingly, the company recorded a $35 million reduction in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and a $4 million increase in its current tax liabilities in the year ended december 31, 2013, which reduced the provision for income taxes and increased net income for the year ended december 31, 2013 by $31 million. as of december 31, 2014, the company expects to record additional reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of approximately $5 million within the next twelve months due to the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments. the company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.
32
the company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the companys ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. the company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company.
the company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. pursuant to these agreements, the company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the companys business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the company or its subcontractors. the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. historically, the companys costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial.
critical accounting policies and estimates summary the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the companys financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the companys results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period. on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its policies and estimates. the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. there are other items within the companys consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service, respectively. the companys deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to shipment of the instrument. at december 31, 2014, the company had current and long-term deferred revenue liabilities of $130 million and $29 million, respectively. revenue is recognized when all of the following revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery or performance has occurred; the vendors fee is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified. shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales, net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order.
33
product shipments, including those for demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received, specifying fixed terms and prices. the company generally recognizes product revenue when legal title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer. the company structures its sales arrangements as shipping point or international equivalent and, accordingly, recognizes revenue upon shipment. in some cases, destination-based shipping terms are included in sales arrangements, in which cases revenue is generally recognized when the products arrive at the customer site.
the companys method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is accounted for in accordance with multiple-element revenue recognition accounting standards. with respect to the installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the best estimate of selling price of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple-element arrangement when installation is complete. the company determines the best estimate of selling price of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours.
instrument service contracts are typically billed at the beginning of the maintenance period. the amount of the service contract is amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument maintenance period. there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. no revenue is recognized until all revenue recognition criteria have been met.
sales of software are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for software revenue recognition. the companys software arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts. software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection is probable, and there are no significant post-delivery obligations remaining. the revenue associated with the software maintenance contract is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis. the company uses the residual method to allocate software revenue when a transaction includes multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of undelivered elements exists. under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered element (maintenance) is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element (software license) and is recognized as revenue.
loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. if the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. the company does not request collateral from its customers, but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit. the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the customer, the credit-worthiness of the customer, industry trends and the macro-economic environment. historically, the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue. material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. the companys accounts receivable balance at december 31, 2014 was $434 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $7 million.
the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis (fifo). the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future demand, including that in the companys current backlog of orders, and industry and market conditions. if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. the companys inventory balance at december 31, 2014 was recorded at its net realizable value of $246 million, which is net of write-downs of $17 million.
34
long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors the company considers important which could trigger impairment include, but are not limited to, the following:
   significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, particularly as it pertains to capitalized software and patent costs;

   significant negative industry or economic trends, competitive products and technologies; and

   significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the companys capitalized patents, purchased technology, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as licenses.

when the company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset, long-lived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset, long-lived asset or goodwill, including its eventual residual value, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is written-down to its estimated fair value. net intangible assets, long-lived assets and goodwill amounted to $232 million, $322 million and $355 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2014.
the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on january 1 of each year. for goodwill impairment review purposes, the company has two reporting units, the waters division and ta division. the company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future; however, there can be no assurance that, at the time future reviews are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded. the factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include, but are not limited to, the following:
   significant decline in the companys projected revenue, earnings or cash flows;

   significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate;

   significant decline in the companys stock price or the stock price of comparable companies;

   adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and

   unanticipated competition.

income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. in the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods, the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance, which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations.
the accounting standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods. in addition, the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money. at december 31, 2014, the company had unrecognized tax benefits of $20 million.
35
warranty product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the companys warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the companys previous estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. at december 31, 2014, the companys warranty liability was $13 million.
litigation as described in item 3, legal proceedings, of part i of this form 10-k, the company is a party to various pending litigation matters. with respect to each pending claim, management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss. if and when management has determined, with respect to a particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss. the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable uncertainty.
pension and other retirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the companys pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management. changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data. critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, are evaluated and updated annually. the company has assumed that the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 6.95% for its u.s. benefit plans and 2.84% for its non-u.s. benefit plans.
at the end of each year, the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer pension discount curve for high quality investments as of december 31, 2014 that best matched the timing of the plans future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. once the interest rates were determined, the plans cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date. at december 31, 2014, the company determined the weighted-average discount rate to be 3.92% for the u.s. benefit plans and 1.98% for the non-u.s. benefits plans.
a one-quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long-term rate of return would decrease the companys net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than $1 million. a one-quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the companys net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than $1 million.
stock-based compensation the accounting standards for stock-based compensation require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. the company has used the black-scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards. under the fair-value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the companys results of operations could be materially impacted. as stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest, the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. these accounting standards require
36
forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of these accounting standards, the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period. the company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method.
as of december 31, 2014, unrecognized compensation costs and related weighted-average lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows (in millions):
unrecognized      weighted-average compensation         life in years costs stock options                        $44                   3.7
restricted stock units                40                   3.5
restricted stock                                            
total                                $84                   3.6
business combinations and asset acquisitions the company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations. the results of each acquisition are included in the companys consolidated results as of the acquisition date and the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. any excess of the fair value consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. acquired in-process research and development (ipr&d) included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred and acquired ipr&d is tested for impairment until completion of the acquired programs. upon commercialization, this indefinite-lived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, subject to periodic impairment reviews. if the research and development project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived asset is charged to expense. legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.
the company also acquires intellectual property through licensing arrangements. these arrangements often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone or royalty payments, contingent upon certain future events. ipr&d acquired in an asset acquisition (as opposed to a business combination) is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use. subsequent payments made for the achievement of milestones are evaluated to determine whether they have an alternative future use or should be expensed. payments made to third parties subsequent to commercialization are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset, and are classified as intangible assets.
contingent consideration in addition to the initial cash consideration paid to acquire medimass, the company is obligated to make additional earnout payments based on a royalty due on future sales of products containing the reims technology. in accordance with the accounting standards for business combinations, the company determines the fair value of the liability for contingent consideration at each reporting date using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model. subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations. the fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including estimated future results and a discount rate reflective of the companys creditworthiness. a change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. although there is no contractual limit, total future undiscounted contingent consideration payments are estimated to be $4 million as of december 31, 2014, based on the companys best estimate, as the earnout is based on future sales of certain products through 2034.

recent accounting standard changes and developments information regarding recent accounting standard changes and developments is incorporated by reference from part ii, item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this document and should be considered an integral part of this item 7. see note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted and issued accounting standards.
item 7a: quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. the company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes other than trading, in accordance with the companys overall risk management guidelines.
the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange-rate risk with respect to certain inter-company balances, forecasted transactions and cash flow, and net assets denominated in euros, japanese yen, british pounds and singapore dollars. the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. in addition, the company utilizes derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations.
the company records its derivative transactions in accordance with the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, which establish the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. all derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities. the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage exposures to foreign currency by hedging the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter-company balances and short-term assets and liabilities. principal hedged currencies include the euro, japanese yen, british pound and brazilian real. the periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts, which are intended to be consistent with changes in the underlying exposures. gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. at december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $110 million, $104 million and $134 million, respectively.
the companys foreign currency exchange contracts included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands):
december 31,      december 31,
2014              2013
other current assets                   $123              $929
other current liabilities              $651               $88
the following is a summary of the activity in the statements of operations related to the forward foreign exchange contracts (in thousands):
year ended december 31,
2014                    2013                  2012
realized gains on closed contracts                $174                        $8,666                  $4,186
unrealized (losses) gains on open contracts             (1,369   )               361                   1,716
cumulative net pre-tax (losses) gains             $(1,195        )            $9,027                  $5,902
assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the u.s. dollar), the fair market value of the forward contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2014 would decrease pre-tax earnings by approximately $11 million.

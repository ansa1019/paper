financial results the results for pseg, pse&g and power for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 are presented below:
years ended december 31,
2014                        2013
earnings (losses)                                        millions, except per share data pse&amp;g                                        $725                        $612
power                                             760                         644
other                                              33                         (13      )
pseg net income                                $1,518                      $1,243
pseg net income per share (diluted)             $2.99                       $2.45
our $275 million 2014 over 2013 increase in net income was due primarily to higher transmission revenues at pse&g and mark-to-market gains in 2014 as compared to losses in 2013 and higher volumes of gas sales under the bgss contract and to third party customers at power. in addition, the increase was also due to lower operations and maintenance (o&m) costs at pse&g and power, principally related to a reduction in pension and other postretirement employee benefit (opeb) costs. these factors were partially offset by lower volumes of electricity sold under the bgs contract and higher fuel costs incurred to generate electricity at power. for a more detailed discussion of our financial results, see results of operations.
at pse&g, our regulated utility, we continued to invest capital in t&d infrastructure projects aimed at maintaining the reliability of our service to our customers. pse&g's results for 2014 reflect the favorable impacts from these investments as well as a slowly improving economy. effective january 1, 2014, pse&g's formula rate increased our annual transmission revenues by approximately $171 million. in october 2014, we filed our 2015 formula rate update with the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) for approximately $182 million in increased annual transmission revenues which went into effect on january 1, 2015. each year, transmission revenues are adjusted to reflect items such as updating estimates used in the filing with actual data. the adjustment for 2015 will include the impact of the extension of bonus depreciation, which was enacted after the filing was made, and is estimated to reduce our 2015 revenue increase as filed by approximately $21 million. over the past few years, these types of investments have altered the business mix of our overall results of operations to reflect a higher percentage contribution by pse&g.
power's results benefited from access to natural gas supplies through its existing firm pipeline transportation contracts during the cold weather experienced in the first quarter of 2014. power manages these contracts for the benefit of pse&g's customers through the bgss arrangement. the contracts are sized to ensure delivery of a reliable gas supply to pse&g customers on peak winter days. when pipeline capacity beyond the customers' needs is available, power can use it to make third party sales and supply gas to its generating units in new jersey.
power's 2014 results were unfavorably impacted by an extended refueling outage at salem unit 2. a planned refueling outage began on april 12, 2014 but was extended due to repairs to the reactor coolant pump turning vanes. salem unit 2 returned to service on july 14, 2014.
regulatory, legislative and other developments in our pursuit of operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment, we closely monitor significant regulatory and legislative developments. transmission planning rules and wholesale power market design are of particular importance to our results and we continue to advocate for policies and rules that promote fair and efficient electricity markets.
transmission planning the ferc's rule under order 1000 altered the right of first refusal (rofr) previously held by incumbent utilities to build all transmission within their respective service territories. our challenge to the rule itself was rejected by the federal court. however, the ferc's action presents opportunities for us to construct transmission outside of our service territory as long as the applicable rules are clear to all participating transmission developers. in april 2013, pjm interconnection, l.l.c. (pjm) initiated a solicitation process pursuant to order 1000 to review technical solutions to improve the operational performance in the artificial island area, consisting of our salem and hope creek nuclear generation facilities. pjm has not yet made a decision in this process. on january 30, 2015, pse&g filed a complaint against pjm at the ferc, arguing that pjm had failed to follow its rules during this process and requesting that the ferc order pjm to do so. if the ferc grants this complaint, the ferc could order pjm to re-start the entire process or make changes to the rules governing future competitive solicitations.
43
pjm filed with the ferc, and the ferc has recently accepted, a new "multi-driver" category of transmission projects, which projects may include a combination of reliability, economic and public policy elements. changes to the factors used in making determinations in the pjm project planning and cost-allocation processes could have significant implications for the types of projects selected and the utility customers ultimately charged for the costs of such new transmission facilities. see part i, item 1. business-federal regulation-transmission regulation-transmission policy developments.
wholesale power market design capacity market design, including the reliability pricing model (rpm), remains an important focus for us. in may 2014, a federal court issued a rule that vacated a ferc order in which the ferc had determined that demand response (dr) providers should receive full market compensation for power and held that the ferc has no jurisdiction over dr. a subsequent challenge to the participation of dr as a resource in the pjm capacity market is pending at the ferc as is a filing made by pjm at the ferc that would remove dr as a supply resource in upcoming auctions. in addition, pjm has filed at the ferc to reset the demand curve for the rpm, which ferc subsequently accepted. we generally supported pjm's approach in the filing but sought rehearing on certain issues, including the proper level of labor costs required to build new generation in new jersey, which is pending. further, in december 2014, pjm filed at the ferc its proposal for a capacity performance product to include generators, dr and energy efficiency providers who would certify as to availability during emergency conditions, as a supplement to base capacity and with enhanced performance-based incentives and penalties. the implications of these developments could be significant for the capacity market. see part i, item 1. business-regulatory issues-federal regulation-capacity market issues-pjm for additional information.
under the pjm capacity auction conducted in may 2014, power cleared 8,693 mw of its generating capacity at an average price of $164.61 mw-day for the 2017-2018 delivery period, a price consistent with what has been realized in the past three auctions. for a more detailed discussion on the rpm capacity auction, refer to part i, item 1. business-federal regulation-capacity market issues-pjm.
in 2014, appeals to challenge the federal court rulings that the new jersey long-term capacity agreement pilot program act to subsidize above-market new generation and a similar action taken by maryland were unconstitutional and null and void were each denied. the appellants subsequently sought review at the u.s. supreme court and the u.s. supreme court has not yet acted. for additional information, refer to part i, item 1. business-regulatory issues-federal regulation-capacity market issues-long-term capacity agreement pilot program act.
a critical aspect of our wholesale energy marketing business is the continued retention of market-based rate (mbr) authority from the ferc for our operating subsidiaries that engage in such activities. on october 14, 2014, the ferc issued an order that accepted our triennial market power update, concluding that our submission satisfied its requirements for retention of mbr authority.
environmental regulation we also advocate for the development and implementation of fair and reasonable rules by the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) and state environmental regulators. on may 19, 2014, the epa released the final clean water act section 316(b) rule on cooling water intake that establishes new requirements for the regulation of cooling water intakes at existing power plants and industrial facilities with a design flow of more than two million gallons of water per day. eight of power's generating facilities and three of its jointly-owned generating facilities are subject to the rule. as adopted by the epa, the rule requires that cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts, primarily by reducing the amount of fish and shellfish that are impinged or entrained at a cooling water intake structure. under this standard, power facilities have the flexibility to select one of several options as their method of compliance. however, the epa has structured the rule so that each state will continue to consider renewal permits for existing power facilities on a case by case basis, and will require facilities to conduct a wide range of studies related to impingement mortality and entrainment and submit the results with their permit applications. a federal court challenge to the epa rule is pending. we are unable to predict the outcome that these permitting decisions may take and the effect, if any, that they may have on us although such impacts could be material. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities and part i, item 1. business-environmental matters-water pollution control for additional information.
in june 2014, the epa issued a proposed greenhouse gas emissions regulation for existing power plants. the regulation establishes state-specific emission rate targets based on implementation of the best system of emission reduction. states may choose these or other methodologies to achieve the necessary reductions of carbon dioxide emissions. the epa had requested comment on many aspects of the proposal and therefore, the final rule may look considerably different than the proposal. we continue to work with state and federal regulators, as well as industry partners, to determine the potential impact of the regulation. see part i, item 1. business-environmental matters-climate change for additional information.
44
in addition, clean air act (caa) regulations governing hazardous air pollutants under the epa's maximum achievable control technology rules are also of significance; however, we believe our generation business remains well-positioned for such air pollution control regulations if and when they are implemented.
other developments in recent years we have been impacted by severe weather conditions, including hurricane irene in 2011 and superstorm sandy in 2012, the latter storm resulting in the highest level of customer outages in our history. for more detailed information, refer to item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities-superstorm sandy. we have begun work in our gas and electric distribution systems to improve resiliency. the new jersey board of public utilities (bpu) approved the settlement of our energy strong proposal in a total amount of $1.22 billion. the settlement provides for cost recovery at a 9.75% rate of return on equity on the first $1.0 billion of the investment, plus associated allowance for funds used during construction, through an accelerated recovery mechanism. we will seek recovery of the remaining $220 million of investment in pse&g's next base rate case, which is to be filed no later than november 1, 2017. we filed our initial energy strong cost recovery petition, seeking bpu approval to recover in base rates an estimated annual revenue increase of $1.1 million effective march 1, 2015. this increase represents capitalized energy strong electric investment costs in service through november 30, 2014. for additional information, refer to part i, item 1. business-regulatory issues-state regulation-energy strong program.
in september 2014, the bpu approved substantially our entire request for a determination that our storm related costs, in the total amount of $366 million, were prudently incurred and recoverable in a future base rate proceeding, subject to offset for the amount of insurance proceeds received. for additional information, refer to item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 5. regulatory assets and liabilities.
on january 1, 2014, we commenced operation of the lipa t&d system under a twelve-year contract with opportunity to extend for an additional eight years. in addition, in january 2015, power assumed responsibility for fuel procurement and power management services to lipa under separate agreements.
in the first and second quarters of 2014, power discovered and further investigated (i) incorrect calculations for certain components of its cost-based bids for its new jersey fossil generating units in the pjm energy market and (ii) differences in the quantity of energy that power offered into the energy market for its fossil peaking units from the amount for which power was compensated in the capacity market for those units. we informed the ferc, pjm and the pjm independent market monitor of these issues, and have corrected these errors. power has an ongoing process of implementing improved procedures to help mitigate the risk of similar issues occurring in the future. in the third quarter of 2014, the ferc staff initiated a preliminary, non-public staff investigation into the matter. this investigation could result in the ferc seeking disgorgement of any over-collected amounts, civil penalties and non-financial remedies. it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the ultimate impact or predict any resulting penalties, other costs associated with this matter, or the applicability of mitigating factors. for more detailed information regarding this matter, refer to item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities-ferc compliance.
operational excellence we emphasize operational performance while developing opportunities in both our competitive and regulated businesses. flexibility in our generating fleet has allowed us to take advantage of market opportunities presented during the year as we remain diligent in managing costs. in 2014, our
•   diverse fuel mix and dispatch flexibility allowed us to generate approximately 54,000 gwh, while addressing unit outages and balancing fuel availability and price volatility,
•   bergen 1 and 2 and linden 1 units and our combined cycle gas turbine fleet overall achieved record generation,
•   hope creek unit achieved its second best generation ever,
•   construction of transmission and solar projects proceeded on schedule and within budget, and
•   utility ranked highest in electric and gas service business customer satisfaction among large utilities in the eastern united states.
financial strength our financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet, positive cash flow and reasonable risk-adjusted returns on increased investment. our financial position remained strong during 2014 as we:
•   had cash on hand of $402 million as of december 31, 2014,
45
•   extended the expiration dates of pseg's $500 million and power's $1.6 billion five-year credit facilities from 2017 to 2019, and maintained substantial liquidity,
•   maintained solid investment grade credit ratings, and
•   paid an annual dividend of $1.48 and increased our indicated annual dividend for 2015 to $1.56 per share.
we expect to be able to fund our transmission projects required under pjm's reliability program, our energy strong program and other projects with internally generated cash and external debt financing.
disciplined investment we utilize rigorous investment criteria when deploying capital and seek to invest in areas that complement our existing business and provide reasonable risk-adjusted returns. these areas include upgrading our energy infrastructure, responding to trends in environmental protection and providing new energy supplies in domestic markets with growing demand. in 2014 we:
•   placed into service our 230 kv burlington-camden and 230 kv north central reliability transmission projects,
•   made additional investments in transmission infrastructure projects,
•   continued to execute our existing bpu-approved utility programs,
•   completed installation of equipment to increase output and improve efficiency at our linden combined cycle gas generating plant and continue to plan for the installation of such equipment at our bergen 2 and bethlehem energy center (bec) combined cycle gas units,
•   completed the physical upgrades for the extended power uprate at peach bottom unit 2,
•   acquired an equity interest with an expected investment of $100 million-$120 million in the approximately 110 mile penneast pipeline to transport natural gas from eastern pennsylvania to new jersey, and
•   acquired rights to solar energy facilities located near el paso, texas and burlington, vermont, totaling 16.6 mwdc which became operational in late 2014 and a 12.9 mwdc solar energy facility located near waldorf, maryland which we expect to be operational before june 2015.
future outlook our future success will depend on our ability to continue to maintain strong operational and financial performance in a slow-moving economy and a cost-constrained environment, to capitalize on or otherwise address appropriately regulatory and legislative developments that impact our business and to respond to the issues and challenges described below. in order to do this, we must continue to
•   focus on controlling costs while maintaining safety and reliability and complying with applicable standards and requirements,
•   successfully manage our energy obligations and re-contract our open supply positions,
•   execute our capital investment program, including our energy strong program and other investments for growth that yield contemporaneous and reasonable risk-adjusted returns, while enhancing the resiliency of our infrastructure and maintaining the reliability of the service we provide to our customers,
•   advocate for measures to ensure the implementation by pjm and the ferc of market design rules that continue to promote fair and efficient electricity markets,
•   engage multiple stakeholders, including regulators, government officials, customers and investors, and
•   successfully operate the lipa t&amp;d system.
for 2015 and beyond, the key issues and challenges we expect our business to confront include:
•   regulatory and political uncertainty, both with regard to future energy policy, design of energy and capacity markets, transmission policy and environmental regulation, as well as with respect to the outcome of any legal, regulatory or other proceeding, settlement, investigation or claim, applicable to us and/or the energy industry,
•   uncertainty in the slowly improving national and regional economic recovery, continuing customer conservation efforts, changes in energy usage patterns and evolving technologies, which impact customer behaviors and demand,
46
•   the continuing potential for sustained lower natural gas and electricity prices, both at market hubs and at locations where we operate, and
•   delays and other obstacles that might arise in connection with the construction of our t&amp;d projects, including in connection with permitting and regulatory approvals.

(a)   pse&amp;g's results in 2012 include after-tax expenses of $24 million for o&amp;m costs and power's results in 2014, 2013 and 2012 include after-tax expenses of $17 million, $32 million and $39 million, respectively, for o&amp;m costs net of insurance recoveries in 2013 and 2012, due to severe damage caused by superstorm sandy. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities.
(b)   other includes after-tax activities at the parent company, pseg li and energy holdings as well as intercompany eliminations.
the 2014 year-over-year increase in our net income was driven primarily by:
•   mark-to-market (mtm) gains in 2014 resulting from a decrease in prices on forward positions, as compared to mtm losses in 2013,
•   higher sales volumes under the basic gas supply service (bgss) contract due to colder average temperatures in the 2014 winter heating season,
•   higher volumes of gas sold to third party customers,
•   higher revenues due to increased investments in transmission projects, and
•   lower o&amp;m expense at pse&amp;g and power, largely due to a reduction in pension and opeb costs.
these increases were partially offset by
•   lower volumes of electricity sold under power's basic generation service (bgs) contracts resulting from serving fewer tranches in 2014, and
•   higher generation costs due to higher fuel costs.
the 2013 year-over-year decrease in our net income was driven by:
•   lower volumes of electricity sold under power's bgs contracts at lower average prices,
•   lower volumes of wholesale load contracts in the pjm and new england (ne) regions,
•   unfavorable amounts related to the mtm activity, discussed below,
•   higher generation costs due to higher fuel costs,
•   higher planned outage and maintenance costs at certain of our fossil and nuclear plants, partially offset by cost control measures,
•   the absence of the gain on the dynegy leveraged lease settlement in 2012, and
47
•   higher income tax expense due to the absence of tax benefits related to the settlement of the 1997-2006 irs audits in 2012 (see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 19. income taxes).
these decreases were largely offset by
•   higher capacity revenues in the pjm region resulting from higher average prices as well as higher generation sold primarily in the pjm region,
•   higher average gas prices on increased sales to third party customers, and
•   higher revenues due to increased investments in transmission projects.
our results include the realized gains, losses and earnings on power's nuclear decommissioning trust (ndt) fund and other related ndt activity. net realized gains, interest and dividend income and other costs related to the ndt fund are recorded in other income and deductions, and impairments on certain ndt securities are recorded as other-than-temporary impairments.  interest accretion expense on power's nuclear asset retirement obligation (aro) is recorded in operation and maintenance expense and the depreciation related to the aro asset is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense. in 2014 and 2012, we restructured portions of our ndt fund and realized gains of $65 million and $59 million, respectively.
our results also include the after-tax impacts of non-trading mtm activity, which consist of the financial impact from positions with forward delivery dates.
the combined after-tax impact on net income for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 include the changes related to ndt fund and mtm activity shown in the chart below:

year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 2013
operating revenues increased $371 million due to changes in generation, gas supply and other operating revenues.
generation revenues increased $263 million due primarily to
•   higher revenues of $366 million due primarily to mtm gains in 2014 resulting from a decrease in prices on forward positions and higher energy volumes sold in the new york and new england (ne) regions, and
•   a net increase of $27 million due primarily to higher volumes on wholesale load contracts in the pjm region, offset in part by lower wholesale load volumes in the ne region,
•   partially offset by a decrease of $89 million due to lower volumes of electricity sold as a result of serving fewer tranches in 2014 under our bgs contracts and lower average pricing, and
•   a net decrease of $41 million due primarily to a decrease in operating reserve revenue, partially offset by higher ancillary revenue in the pjm region.
gas supply revenues increased $93 million due primarily to
•   a net increase of $44 million in sales under the bgss contract, substantially comprised of higher sales volumes due to colder average temperatures during the 2014 winter heating season, partially offset by lower average gas prices, and
•   a net increase of $49 million due to higher sales volumes to third party customers.
other operating revenues increased $15 million due to transition fees related to fuel management and power supply management contracts with lipa.
operating expenses energy costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel costs for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet power's obligation under its bgss contract with pse&g. energy costs increased $251 million due to
•   generation costs increased $252 million due primarily to higher fuel costs, reflecting higher average realized natural gas prices, the unfavorable mtm impact from lower average natural gas prices on forward positions and the utilization of higher volumes of gas and oil. these increased costs were partially offset by lower congestion costs in the pjm region.
•   gas costs decreased $1 million related to a decrease of $137 million in average gas inventory costs, substantially offset by $136 million of higher volumes sold under the bgss contract and to third party customers due to colder average temperatures during the 2014 winter heating season.
52
operation and maintenance decreased $38 million due primarily to
•   lower pension and opeb costs of $42 million,
•   a decrease of $15 million due primarily to the outage of our 100%-owned hope creek nuclear facility in the fall of 2013, which was partially offset by the extension of our 57%-owned nuclear salem unit 2 refueling outage in 2014, and
•   a decrease of $27 million due to lower storm costs related to superstorm sandy,
•   partially offset by an increase of $40 million related primarily to higher planned outage and maintenance costs at our fossil plants, including maintenance and installation of upgraded technology at our linden combined cycle gas generating plant and outages at our keystone and hudson facilities.
depreciation and amortization increased $19 million due primarily to a higher depreciable fossil and nuclear asset base.
income from equity method investments experienced no material change.
other income (deductions) increased $65 million due primarily to higher realized gains from the ndt fund due to the restructuring of the portfolio in 2014.
other-than-temporary impairments increased $8 million due to an increase in impairments of the ndt fund.
interest expense increased $6 million due primarily to the issuance of a $250 million 2.45% senior note and a $250 million 4.30% senior note in november 2013, partially offset by the maturity of $300 million of 2.50% senior notes in april 2013.
income tax expense increased $72 million in 2014 due primarily to higher pre-tax income.
year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to 2012
operating revenues increased $190 million due to changes in generation and supply revenues.
generation revenues increased $102 million due primarily to
•   an increase of $341 million due to higher capacity revenues resulting from higher average auction prices and an increase in operating reserve revenues in pjm, and
•   higher net revenues of $36 million due primarily to higher generation sold in the pjm and ne regions partly offset by higher mtm losses in 2013 resulting from an increase in prices on forward positions in the pjm and ne regions,
•   partially offset by a decrease of $155 million due primarily to lower volumes of electricity sold under our bgs contracts and lower average pricing, and
•   a net decrease of $120 million due to lower volumes on wholesale load contracts in the pjm and ne regions.
gas supply revenues increased $88 million due primarily to
•   a net increase of $40 million in sales under the bgss contract, substantially comprised of higher sales volumes due to colder average temperatures during the 2013 winter heating season, partially offset by lower average gas prices, and
•   a net increase of $48 million due primarily to higher average gas prices and higher sales volumes to third party customers.
operating expenses energy costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel costs for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet power's obligation under its bgss contract with pse&g. energy costs increased $115 million due to
•   generation costs increased $75 million due primarily to $84 million of higher fuel costs, reflecting higher average realized natural gas prices, higher nuclear fuel costs and the utilization of higher volumes of coal and oil, partially offset by lower average coal prices and lower average unrealized natural gas prices on forward positions.
•   gas costs increased $40 million, principally related to obligations under the bgss contract, reflecting higher sales volumes in 2013 due to colder average temperatures during the 2013 winter heating season and higher volumes on third party sales, partially offset by lower average gas inventory costs.
53
operation and maintenance increased $97 million due primarily to
•   higher planned outage and maintenance costs in 2013, mainly at our gas-fired bec plant in new york, bergen gas-fired plant in new jersey, linden gas-fired plant in new jersey and 23%-owned conemaugh coal-fired plant in pennsylvania, partially offset by lower storm costs in 2013, and
•   higher outage costs at our nuclear generating facilities, primarily at our 100%-owned hope creek station.
depreciation and amortization increased $31 million due primarily to a higher depreciable asset base at fossil and nuclear, including placing into service the new gas-fired peaking units at kearny, new jersey and new haven, connecticut in june 2012, completion of the steam path retrofit upgrade at our co-owned peach bottom unit 2 in october 2012, and placing two solar facilities into service in the fourth quarter of 2012. in addition, an update to the nuclear asset retirement obligation became effective in november 2012, causing higher depreciation in 2013.
income from equity method investments experienced no material change.
other income (deductions) decreased $6 million due primarily to lower ndt fund realized gains in 2013, partially offset by lower ndt fund realized losses in 2013. in addition, we recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt in 2012.
other-than-temporary impairments decreased $6 million due to lower impairments on the ndt fund in 2013.
interest expense decreased $16 million due primarily to a decrease of $23 million resulting from the maturity of $300 million of 2.50% of senior notes in april 2013, and the early redemptions of $250 million of 5.00% medium term notes and various tax-exempt bonds in december 2012, partially offset by higher interest costs of $6 million in 2013 since interest capitalization ceased for our kearny and new haven gas-fired peaking projects on their june 2012 in-service date.
income tax expense decreased $14 million in 2013 due primarily to lower pre-tax income.
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis, noting the uses and contributions, where material, of our two direct major operating subsidiaries.
financing methodology we expect our capital requirements to be met through internally generated cash flows and external financings, consisting of short-term debt for working capital needs and long-term debt for capital investments.
pse&g's sources of external liquidity include a $600 million multi-year syndicated credit facility. pse&g's commercial paper program is the primary vehicle for meeting seasonal, intra-month and temporary working capital needs. pse&g does not engage in any intercompany borrowing or lending. pse&g maintains back-up facilities in an amount sufficient to cover the commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding. pse&g's dividend payments to pseg are consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings. pse&g's long-term financing plan is designed to replace maturities, fund a portion of its capital program and manage short-term debt balances. generally, pse&g uses either secured medium-term notes or first mortgage bonds to raise long-term capital.
pseg, power, energy holdings, pseg li and services participate in a corporate money pool, an aggregation of daily cash balances designed to efficiently manage their respective short-term liquidity needs. servco does not participate in the corporate money pool. servco's short-term liquidity needs are met through an account funded and owned by lipa.
pseg's sources of external liquidity include multi-year syndicated credit facilities totaling $1 billion. these facilities are available to back-stop pseg's commercial paper program, issue letters of credit and for general corporate purposes. these facilities may also be used to provide support to pseg's subsidiaries. pseg's credit facilities and the commercial paper program are available to support pseg working capital needs or to temporarily fund growth opportunities in advance of obtaining permanent financing. from time to time, pseg may make equity contributions or provide credit support to its subsidiaries.
power's sources of external liquidity include $2.6 billion of syndicated multi-year credit facilities. additionally, from time to time, power maintains bilateral credit agreements designed to enhance its liquidity position. power has $100 million of bilateral credit agreements that are scheduled to expire in september 2015. credit capacity is primarily used to provide collateral in support of power's forward energy sale and forward fuel purchase contracts as the market prices for energy and fuel fluctuate, and to meet potential collateral postings in the event of a credit rating downgrade below investment grade. power's dividend payments to pseg are also designed to be consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings and provide sufficient financial flexibility. generally, power issues senior unsecured debt to raise long-term capital.
54
operating cash flows we expect our operating cash flows combined with cash on hand and financing activities to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and shareholder dividend payments.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, our operating cash flow increased by $2 million. for the year ended december 31, 2013, our operating cash flow increased by $371 million. the net changes were primarily due to net changes from our subsidiaries as discussed below and tax payments at the parent company and energy holdings.
pse&g pse&g's operating cash flow increased $188 million from $1,645 million to $1,833 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to 2013, due primarily to
•   higher earnings,
•   an increase of $188 million due to an increase from a net change in regulatory deferrals, primarily related to over collections of bgss gas costs, the over collection of gas revenues due to the gas weather normalization clause and gprc rate recoveries,
•   an increase of $83 million due to decrease in employee benefit plan funding,
•   partially offset by $199 million related to higher tax payments.
pse&g's operating cash flow increased $389 million from $1,256 million to $1,645 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to
•   higher earnings,
•   an increase of $134 million due to an increase from a net change in regulatory deferrals, primarily related to over collections of bgss gas costs and the collection of prior year deficiency revenues under the gas weather normalization clause mechanism, and
•   a decrease of $47 million in benefit plan funding,
•   partially offset by $114 million related to higher tax payments.
power power's operating cash flow increased $78 million from $1,347 million to $1,425 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily resulting from
•   lower tax payments,
•   partially offset by increase of $87 million in payments to counterparties, and
•   a decrease of $11 million due to collection of counterparty receivables.
power's operating cash flow decreased $106 million from $1,453 million to $1,347 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, as compared to 2012, primarily resulting from
•   lower earnings, and
•   higher tax payments,
•   partially offset by a decrease of $73 million related to margin deposits, and
•   a decrease of $26 million in employee benefit plan funding.
short-term liquidity we continually monitor our liquidity and seek to add capacity as needed to meet our liquidity requirements. each of our credit facilities is restricted as to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below; however, if necessary, the pseg facilities can also be used to support our subsidiaries' liquidity needs. our total credit facilities and available liquidity as of december 31, 2014 were as follows:

as of december 31, 2014, our credit facility capacity was in excess of our projected maximum liquidity requirements over our 12 month planning horizon. our maximum liquidity requirements are based on stress scenarios that incorporate changes in commodity prices and the potential impact of power losing its investment grade credit rating. pse&g's credit facility primary use is to support its commercial paper program under which as of december 31, 2014, no amounts were outstanding. most of our credit facilities expire in 2018 and 2019. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities and note 13. schedule of consolidated debt.
long-term debt financing pse&g has $300 million of 2.70%, series g medium term notes maturing in may 2015.
power has a $300 million of 5.50% senior notes maturing in december 2015.
for a discussion of our long-term debt transactions during 2014 and into 2015, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 13. schedule of consolidated debt.
debt covenants our credit agreements contain maximum debt to equity ratios and other restrictive covenants and conditions to borrowing. we are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants. continued compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon our future financial position, level of earnings and cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given.
in addition, under its first and refunding mortgage (mortgage), pse&g may issue new first and refunding mortgage bonds against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges calculated in accordance with its mortgage is at least 2 to 1, and/or against retired mortgage bonds. as of december 31, 2014, pse&g's mortgage coverage ratio was 5.6 to 1 and the mortgage would permit up to approximately $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of new mortgage bonds to be issued against additions and improvements to its property.
default provisions our bank credit agreements and indentures contain various default provisions that could result in the potential acceleration of payment under the defaulting company's agreement. we have not defaulted under these agreements.
pseg's bank credit agreements contain cross default provisions under which events at power or pse&g, including payment defaults, bankruptcy events, the failure to satisfy certain final judgments or other events of default under their financing agreements, would each constitute an event of default. under the bank credit agreements, it would be an event of default if both pse&g and power cease to be wholly owned by pseg.
there are no cross default provisions to affiliates in pse&g's or power's credit agreements or indentures.
ratings triggers our debt indentures and credit agreements do not contain any material 'ratings triggers' that would cause an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. however, in the event of a downgrade, any one or more of the affected companies may be subject to increased interest costs on certain bank debt and certain collateral requirements. in the event that we are not able to affirm representations and warranties on credit agreements, lenders would not be required to make loans.
in accordance with bpu requirements under the bgs contracts, pse&g is required to maintain an investment grade credit rating. if pse&g were to lose its investment grade rating, it would be required to file a plan to assure continued payment for the bgs requirements of its customers.
56
pse&g is the servicer for the bonds issued by pse&g transition funding llc and pse&g transition funding ii llc. cash collected by pse&g to service these bonds is commingled with pse&g's other cash until it is remitted to the bond trustee each month. if pse&g were to lose its investment grade rating, pse&g would be required to remit collected cash daily to the bond trustee. pse&g is prohibited from advancing its own funds to make payments related to such bonds.
fluctuations in commodity prices or a deterioration of power's credit rating to below investment grade could increase power's required margin postings under various agreements entered into in the normal course of business. power believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet the required posting of collateral which would likely result from a credit rating downgrade at today's market prices.

on february 17, 2015, our board of directors approved a $0.39 per share common stock dividend for the first quarter of 2015. this reflects an indicated annual dividend rate of $1.56 per share. we expect to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our businesses, alternate investment opportunities, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.
credit ratings if the rating agencies lower or withdraw our credit ratings, such revisions may adversely affect the market price of our securities and serve to materially increase our cost of capital and limit access to capital. credit ratings shown are for securities that we typically issue. outlooks are shown for corporate credit ratings (s&p) and issuer credit ratings (moody's and fitch) and can be stable, negative, or positive. there is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised by the rating agencies, if, in their respective judgments, circumstances warrant. each rating given by an agency should be evaluated independently of the other agencies' ratings. the ratings should not be construed as an indication to buy, hold or sell any security.
in may 2014, moody's published updated research reports on pseg, pse&g and power and the existing ratings and outlooks were unchanged. in may 2014, s&p published updated research reports and revised the outlook to positive from stable for pseg's corporate credit rating. s&p also affirmed the senior unsecured rating of bbb+ at power and mortgage bond rating of a at pse&g. in october 2014, fitch affirmed the ratings and outlooks for pseg, pse&g and power.

(c)   fitch ratings range from aaa (highest) to d (lowest) for long-term securities and f1 (highest) to d (lowest) for short-term securities.
other comprehensive income for the year ended december 31, 2014, we had other comprehensive loss of $188 million on a consolidated basis. other comprehensive loss was due primarily to a $173 million increase in our consolidated liability for pension and postretirement benefits and a $27 million decrease in net unrealized gains related to available-for-sale securities, and was partially offset by $12 million of unrealized gains on derivative contracts accounted for as hedges. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 20. accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax for additional information.
capital requirements it is expected that all of our capital requirements over the next three years will come from a combination of internally generated funds and external debt financing. projected capital construction and investment expenditures, excluding nuclear fuel purchases, for the next three years are presented in the table below. these amounts are subject to change, based on various factors. we will continue to approach non-regulated solar and other renewables investments opportunistically, seeking projects that will provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.

pse&g pse&g's projections for future capital expenditures include material additions and replacements to its transmission and distribution systems to meet expected growth and to manage reliability. as project scope and cost estimates develop, pse&g will modify its current projections to include these required investments. pse&g's projected expenditures for the various items reported above are primarily comprised of the following:
•   reliability enhancements-investments made to maintain the reliability and efficiency of the system or function.
•   facility replacement-investments made to replace systems or equipment in kind.
•   support facilities-ancillary equipment needed to support the business lines, such as computers, office furniture and buildings and structures housing support personnel or equipment/inventory.
•   new business-investments made in support of new business (e.g. to add new customers).
•   environmental/regulatory-investments made in response to environmental, regulatory or legal mandates.
•   renewables-investments made in response to regulatory or legal mandates relating to renewable energy.
in 2014, pse&g made $2,170 million of capital expenditures, including $2,164 million of investment in plant, primarily for transmission and distribution system reliability and $6 million in solar loan investments. this does not include expenditures for cost of removal, net of salvage, of $98 million, which are included in operating cash flows.
power power's projected expenditures for the various items listed above are primarily comprised of the following:
•   baseline-investments to replace major parts and enhance operational performance.
•   environmental/regulatory-investments made in response to environmental, regulatory or legal mandates.
•   fossil growth opportunities-investments associated with upgrades to increase efficiency and output at combined cycle plants.
•   nuclear expansion-investments associated with certain nuclear capital projects, primarily at existing facilities designed to increase operating output.
•   solar expansion-investments associated with the construction of utility-scale photovoltaic facilities.
in 2014, power made $460 million of capital expenditures, excluding $166 million for nuclear fuel, primarily related to various projects at fossil and nuclear.
disclosures about long-term maturities, contractual and commercial obligations and certain investments the following table reflects our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in the respective periods in which they are due. in addition, the table summarizes anticipated recourse and non-recourse debt maturities for the years shown. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 13. schedule of consolidated debt.
the table below does not reflect any anticipated cash payments for pension obligations due to uncertain timing of payments or liabilities for uncertain tax positions since we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of liability payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 19. income taxes for additional information.

off-balance sheet arrangements power power issues guarantees in conjunction with certain of its energy contracts. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities for further discussion.
other through energy holdings, we have investments in leveraged leases that are accounted for in accordance with gaap accounting for leases. leveraged lease investments generally involve three parties: an owner/lessor, a creditor and a lessee. in a typical leveraged lease arrangement, the lessor purchases an asset to be leased. the purchase price is typically financed 80% with debt provided by the creditor and the balance comes from equity funds provided by the lessor. the creditor provides long-term financing to the transaction secured by the property subject to the lease. such long-term financing is non-recourse to the lessor and is not presented on our consolidated balance sheets. in the event of default, the leased asset, and in some cases the lessee, secures the loan. as a lessor, energy holdings has ownership rights to the property and rents the property to the lessees for use in their business operations. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 6. long-term investments.
in the event that collection of the minimum lease payments to be received by energy holdings is no longer reasonably assured, the accounting treatment for some of the leases may change. in such cases, energy holdings may deem that a lessee has a high probability of defaulting on the lease obligation, and would reclassify the lease from a leveraged lease to an operating lease and would consider the need to record an impairment of its investment. should this event occur, the fair value of the underlying asset and the associated debt would be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets instead of the net equity investment in the lease.
critical accounting estimates under gaap, many accounting standards require the use of estimates, variable inputs and assumptions (collectively referred to as estimates) that are subjective in nature. because of this, differences between the actual measure realized versus the estimate can have a material impact on results of operations, financial position and cash flows. we have determined that the following estimates are considered critical to the application of rules that relate to the respective businesses.
accounting for pensions pseg sponsors several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering pseg's and its participating affiliates' current and former employees who meet certain eligibility criteria. the market-related value of plan assets held for the qualified pension plan is equal to the fair value of these assets as of year-end. the plan assets are comprised of investments in both debt and equity securities which are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. we calculate pension costs using various economic and demographic assumptions.
assumptions and approach used: economic assumptions include the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on trust assets. demographic assumptions include projections of future mortality rates, pay increases and retirement patterns.
assumption                         2014          2013          2012
discount rate                      4.20   %      5.00   %      4.20   %
rate of return on plan assets      8.00   %      8.00   %      8.00   %
the discount rate used to calculate pension obligations is determined as of december 31 each year, our measurement date. the discount rate used to determine year-end obligations is also used to develop the following year's net periodic pension cost.
in selecting the annual discount rate to calculate benefit obligations, we utilize a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds with cash flows that match the benefit plan liability. the composite yield on the hypothetical bond portfolio reflects the rate at which the obligations could effectively be settled.
our expected rate of return on plan assets reflects current asset allocations, historical long-term investment performance and an estimate of future long-term returns by asset class and long-term inflation assumptions.
based on the above assumptions, we have estimated net periodic pension expense of approximately $55 million, net of amounts capitalized.
61
we utilize a corridor approach that reduces the volatility of reported pension expense /income. the corridor requires differences between actuarial assumptions and plan results be deferred and amortized as part of expense/income. this occurs only when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the pension benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets as of each year-end. the excess would be amortized over the average remaining service period of the active employees, which is approximately eight years.
effect if different assumptions used: as part of the business planning process, we have modeled future costs assuming an 8.00% rate of return and a 4.20% discount rate for 2015. actual future pension expense/income and funding levels will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, funding levels relative to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans.
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions. the effects of the assumption changes shown below solely reflect the impact of that specific assumption.

hedge and mtm accounting current guidance requires us to recognize the fair value of derivative instruments, not designated as normal purchases or normal sales, at their fair value on the balance sheet. many non-trading contracts qualify for normal purchases and normal sales exemption and are accounted for upon settlement.
assumptions and approach used: in general, the fair value of our derivative instruments is determined by reference to quoted market prices from contracts listed on exchanges or from brokers. some of these derivative contracts are long-term and rely on forward price quotations over the entire duration of the derivative contracts.
for a small number of contracts where quoted market prices are not available, we utilize mathematical models that rely on historical data to develop forward pricing information in the determination of fair value.
we have entered into various derivative instruments to manage risk from changes in commodity prices and interest rates. in accordance with our hedging strategy, derivatives that are hedging these risks and qualify are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. for derivatives designated as hedges, the change in the value of a derivative instrument is measured against the offsetting change in the value of the underlying contract, anticipated transaction or other business condition that the derivative instrument is intended to hedge. this is known as the measure of hedge effectiveness. changes in the fair value of the effective portion of a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings. changes in the fair value of the effective portion of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. any hedge ineffectiveness is included in current period earnings. during periods of extreme price volatility, there will be significant changes in the value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
for our wholesale energy business, many of the forward sale, forward purchase, option and other contracts are derivative instruments that hedge commodity price risk, but do not meet the requirements for either cash flow or fair value hedge accounting. the changes in value of such derivative contracts are marked to market through earnings as the related commodity prices fluctuate. as a result, our earnings may experience significant fluctuations depending on the volatility of commodity prices.
effect if different assumptions used: any significant changes to the fair market values of our derivatives instruments could result in a material change in the value of the assets or liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and could result in a material change to the unrealized gains or losses recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.
for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 15. financial risk management activities.

lease investments our investments in leases, included in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets, are comprised of lease receivables (net of non-recourse debt), the estimated residual value of leased assets, and unearned and deferred income. a significant portion of the estimated residual value of leased assets is related to merchant power plants leased to other energy companies. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 6. long-term investments and note 7. financing receivables.
assumptions and approach used: residual values are the estimated values of the leased assets at the end of the respective lease terms. the estimated values are calculated by discounting the cash flows related to the leased assets after the lease term. for the merchant power plants, the estimated discounted cash flows are dependent upon various assumptions, including:
•   estimated forward power and capacity prices in the years after the lease,
•   related prices of fuel for the plants,
•   dispatch rates for the plants,
•   future capital expenditures required to maintain the plants,
•   future operation and maintenance expenses, and
•   discount rates.
residual valuations are performed annually for each plant subject to lease using specific assumptions tailored to each plant. those annual valuations are compared to the recorded residual values to determine if an impairment is warranted.
effect if different assumptions used: a significant change to the assumptions, such as a large decrease in near-term power prices that affects the market's view of long-term power prices, or a change in the credit rating or bankruptcy of a counterparty, could result in an impairment of one or more of the residual values, but not necessarily to all of the residual values. however, if, because of changes in assumptions, all the residual values related to the merchant energy plants were deemed to be zero, we would recognize an after-tax charge to income of approximately $177 million.
ndt fund our ndt fund comprises both debt and equity securities. the assets in the ndt fund are classified as available-for-sale securities and are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) unless securities with such unrealized losses are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. unrealized losses that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired are charged against earnings rather than accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reflected as a separate line in the consolidated statement of operations. realized gains, losses and dividend and interest income are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as other income and other deductions.
assumptions and approach used: the ndt fund investments are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 16. fair value measurements for additional information.
effect if different assumptions used: any significant changes to the fair market values of the fund securities could result in a material change in the value of our ndt fund with a corresponding impact to earnings, which could potentially result in additional funding requirements to satisfy our decommissioning obligations. see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information.
asset retirement obligations (aro)
pse&g, power and services recognize liabilities for the expected cost of retiring long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. these aros are recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred and are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets. pse&g, as a rate-regulated entity, recognizes regulatory assets or liabilities as a result of timing differences between the recording of costs and costs recovered through the rate-making process. we accrete the aro liability to reflect the passage of time.
assumptions and approach used: because quoted market prices are not available for aros, we estimate the initial fair value of an aro by calculating discounted cash flows that are dependent upon various assumptions, including:
•   estimation of dates for retirement,
•   amounts and timing of future cash expenditures associated with retirement, settlement or remediation activities,
63
•   discount rates,
•   cost escalation rates,
•   market risk premium,
•   inflation rates, and
•   if applicable, past experience with government regulators regarding similar obligations.
we obtain updated cost studies triennially unless new information necessitates more frequent updates. the most recent cost study was done in 2012. when we revise any assumptions used to calculate fair values of existing aros, we adjust the aro balance and corresponding long-lived asset which impacts the amount of accretion and depreciation expense recognized in future periods.
nuclear decommissioning aros aros related to the future decommissioning of power's nuclear facilities comprised 93% of power's total aros as of december 31, 2014. power determines its aros for its nuclear units by assigning probability weighting to various discounted cash flow outcomes for each of its nuclear units that incorporate the assumptions above as well as:
•   license renewals,
•   early shutdown,
•   safe storage for a period of time after retirement, and
•   recovery from the federal government of costs incurred for spent nuclear fuel.
effect if different assumptions used: changes in the assumptions could result in a material change in the aro balance sheet obligation and the period over which we accrete to the ultimate liability. for example, a decrease of 1% in the discount rate would result in a $141 million increase in the nuclear aro as of december 31, 2014. an increase of 1% in the inflation rate would result in a $372 million increase in the nuclear aro as of december 31, 2014. also, if we did not assume that we would recover from the federal government the costs incurred for spent nuclear fuel, the nuclear aro would increase by $302 million at december 31, 2014.
accounting for regulated businesses pse&g prepares its financial statements to comply with gaap for rate-regulated enterprises, which differs in some respects from accounting for non-regulated businesses. in general, accounting for rate-regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation. as a result, a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs (regulatory asset) or recognize obligations (regulatory liability) if the rates established are designed to recover the costs and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged or collected. this accounting results in the recognition of revenues and expenses in different time periods than that of enterprises that are not regulated.
assumptions and approach used: pse&g recognizes regulatory assets where it is probable that such costs will be recoverable in future rates from customers and regulatory liabilities where it is probable that refunds will be made to customers in future billings. the highest degree of probability is an order from the bpu either approving recovery of the deferred costs over a future period or requiring the refund of a liability over a future period.
virtually all of pse&g's regulatory assets and liabilities are supported by bpu orders. in the absence of an order, pse&g will consider the following when determining whether to record a regulatory asset or liability:
•   past experience regarding similar items with the bpu,
•   treatment of a similar item in an order by the bpu for another utility,
•   passage of new legislation, and
•   recent discussions with the bpu.
all deferred costs are subject to prudence reviews by the bpu. when the recovery of a regulatory asset or payment of a regulatory liability is no longer probable, pse&g charges or credits earnings, as appropriate.
64
effect if different assumptions used: a change in the above assumptions may result in a material impact on our results of operations or our cash flows. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 5. regulatory assets and liabilities for a description of the amounts and nature of regulatory balance sheet amounts.

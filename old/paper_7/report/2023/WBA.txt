certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements and associated notes may not add due to rounding. all percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts for each of the periods presented.
introduction and segments walgreens boots alliance, inc. and its subsidiaries ("walgreens boots alliance" or the "company") is an integrated healthcare, pharmacy and retail leader with a 170-year heritage of caring for customers and patients. its operations are conducted through three reportable segments:
•u.s. retail pharmacy,
•international, and
•u.s. healthcare.
in fiscal 2022, the company changed the name of two reportable segments to better align with the company's business activities, structure and strategy. the "united states" segment was renamed to "u.s. retail pharmacy" and the "walgreens health" segment was renamed to "u.s. healthcare". the segment name changes did not result in any change to the composition of the segments and therefore no change to the historical results of segment operations. the information for these segments for all periods included in these consolidated financial statements has been presented using the new names. see note 17. segment reporting and note 18. sales, to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further information.
factors, trends and uncertainties affecting our results and comparability the company has been, and we expect it to continue to be, affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations. these factors include: the impact of opioid litigation settlements, the impact of adverse global macroeconomic conditions caused by factors including, among others, inflation, high interest rates, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and pandemics like covid-19 on our operations and financial results; the financial performance of our equity method investees, including cencora, inc. ("cencora"), formerly known as amerisourcebergen corporation, the financial performance of our consolidated subsidiaries in the u.s. healthcare segment; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payor and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; strategic transactions and acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including the tax law changes in the united states ("u.s.") and the united kingdom ("uk"); changes in trade tariffs, including trade relations between the u.s. and china, and international relations, including the uk's withdrawal from the european union and its impact on our operations and prospects, and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our transformational cost management program (as defined herein); the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; fluctuations in variable costs; adjustments to centers for medicare and medicaid services, medicare advantage and medicare rates; the impacts of looting, natural disasters, war, terrorism and other catastrophic events, and changes to management, including turnover of our top executives and our ability to retract and retain qualified associates in the markets in which the company operates.
specialty pharmacy specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the u.s., a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. to better serve the evolving specialty pharmacy market, in march 2017, the company and prime therapeutics llc ("prime"), a pbm, closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, alliancerx walgreens prime, using an innovative model that sought to align pharmacy, pbms and health plans to coordinate patient care, improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities. on december 31, 2021, the company purchased prime's portion of the joint venture and now wholly owns the joint venture, which was renamed alliancerx walgreens. certain clients of alliancerx walgreens are not obligated to contract through alliancerx walgreens, and have in the past, and may in the future, enter into specialty pharmacy and other agreements without involving alliancerx walgreens. certain clients have chosen not to renew their contracts through alliancerx walgreens which impacts gross sales. however, considering the relatively low margin nature of this business, the company does not anticipate this will have a material impact on operating income.
wba fiscal 2023 form 10-k opioid litigation settlements on november 2, 2022, the company announced that it had agreed to financial amounts and payment terms as part of settlement frameworks (the "settlement frameworks") that have the potential to resolve a substantial majority of opioid-related lawsuits filed against the company by the attorneys general of participating states and political subdivisions (the "settling states") and litigation brought by counsel for tribes. on december 9, 2022, the company committed the settlement frameworks to a proposed settlement agreement (the "proposed settlement agreement"). the proposed settlement agreement became effective on august 7, 2023 (the "multistate settlement agreement"). as of august 31, 2023, the company has accrued a total $7.0 billion liability associated with the multistate settlement agreement and other opioid-related claims and litigation settlements. the cost of the settlements is reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings within selling, general and administrative expenses as part of the u.s. retail pharmacy segment.
see note 11. commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further information.
covid-19
since 2020, covid-19 has severely impacted, and may continue to directly and indirectly impact, the economies of the u.s., the uk and other countries around the world. covid-19 created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility, uncertainty and economic and supply chain disruption in every region in which we operate, which has adversely affected our industries and our business operations. further, financial and credit markets experienced volatility and could continue to experience volatility due to covid-19 and other factors.
the company has and continues to play a critical role in fighting covid-19. the company has worked with the centers for disease control and prevention, u.s. department of health and human services and the u.s. government to help administer covid-19 vaccinations to the general public and to high priority groups, including long-term care facility residents and staff. fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 results included significant contributions from covid-19 vaccinations and related sales, net of incremental labor and other costs related to the vaccination program. in fiscal 2023, the company has seen significantly lower covid-19 vaccine and testing volume. as a result, these covid-19 related items had a net unfavorable impact on our results for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.
the company continues to monitor covid-19 and its potential future impacts on the consumer, customer and healthcare utilization patterns, as well as the u.s. and global economies, including supply chains and the labor force. as a result, the financial and/or operational impact on the company, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact, singularly or collectively, could be material and adverse.
the company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ. factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" and in item 1a, risk factors.
u.s. healthcare the company's u.s. healthcare segment, created at the beginning of fiscal 2022, is a consumer-centric, technology-enabled healthcare business that engages consumers through a personalized, omni-channel experience across the care journey. the u.s. healthcare segment delivers improved health outcomes and lower costs for payors and providers by delivering care through owned and partnered assets.
the u.s. healthcare segment currently consists of a majority position in village practice management company, llc ("villagemd"), a national provider of value-based care with primary, multi-specialty, and urgent care providers serving patients in traditional clinic settings, in patients' homes and online appointments; shields health solutions parent, llc ("shields"), a specialty pharmacy integrator and accelerator for hospitals, ccx next, llc ("carecentrix"), a participant in the post-acute and home care management sectors; and the walgreens health organic business that contracts with payors and providers to deliver clinical healthcare services to their members and members' caregivers through both digital and physical channels.
the company is aligned into three reportable segments: u.s. retail pharmacy, international and u.s. healthcare. fiscal 2021 data related to the u.s. healthcare segment, has been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to conform to the current period presentation.
see note 17. segment reporting to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 herein for further information.

transformational cost management program on december 20, 2018, the company announced a transformational cost management program that was expected to deliver in excess of $2.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the "transformational cost management program"). the company achieved this goal at the end of fiscal 2021.
on october 12, 2021, the company expanded and extended the transformational cost management program through the end of fiscal 2024 and increased its annual cost savings target to $3.3 billion by the end of fiscal 2024. in fiscal 2022, the company increased its annual cost savings target from $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2024. in fiscal 2023, the company increased its annual cost savings target from $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2024. the company is currently on track to achieve the savings target.
the transformational cost management program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the company's information technology (it) capabilities, is designed to help the company achieve increased cost efficiencies. to date, the company has taken actions across all aspects of the transformational cost management program which focus primarily on the u.s. retail pharmacy and international reportable segments along with the company's global functions. divisional optimization within the company's segments includes activities such as optimization of stores. the company now plans to reduce its presence by up to 300 boots stores in the uk and up to 200 stores in the u.s. by end of fiscal 2024, which are incremental to the fiscal 2022 previously planned reductions of approximately 350 boots stores in the uk and approximately 450 to 500 stores in the u.s. as of august 31, 2023, the company has closed 291 and 466 stores in the uk and u.s., respectively.
in fiscal 2023, the company increased its estimate of cumulative pre-tax charges to its gaap financial results for the transformational cost management program from $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion. as a result, pre-tax charges for exit and disposal activities increased from $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion. the company currently estimates that it will recognize aggregate pre-tax charges to its gaap financial results related to the transformational cost management program as follows:

1.includes impairments relating to operating lease right-of-use and finance lease assets.
2.primarily related to store closures and other asset impairments.
the company estimates that approximately 75% of the cumulative pre-tax charges relating to the transformational cost management program represent current or future cash expenditures, primarily related to employee severance and business transition costs, it transformation and lease and other real estate payments. the amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. the actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements".

wba fiscal 2023 form 10-k walgreens boots alliance results of operations the following information summarizes our results of operations for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. for discussion related to the results of operations by segment for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, refer to part ii, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our fiscal 2022 form 10-k, as amended by form 10-k/a which was filed with the united states securities and exchange commission on november 23, 2022.
net loss (gaap) from continuing operations fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
fiscal 2023 net loss attributable to the company was $3.1 billion compared to net earnings of $4.3 billion in the year ago period. diluted net loss per share was $3.57 compared to diluted net earnings per share of $5.01 in the year ago period. the decrease in net earnings and diluted net earnings per share reflects a $5.5 billion after-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation in the current year and a $2.5 billion after-tax gain on the company's investments in villagemd and shields in the year ago period, partly offset by a $1.7 billion after-tax gain from the partial sale of the company's investments in cencora and the complete sale of the company's investment in option care health.
operating loss was $6.9 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to operating income of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2022. the decrease is primarily driven by a $6.8 billion pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation settlements, lower volumes of covid-19 vaccinations and testing, and planned payroll investments in the u.s. retail pharmacy segment, partly offset by higher boots uk intangible assets impairment charges in the year ago period, lower incentive accruals, international segment growth, and improved retail contributions in the u.s.
other income, net in fiscal 2023 was $2.0 billion compared to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2022. the decrease in other income is mainly due to the gains on the company's investments in villagemd and shields in the year ago period, partly offset by the pre-tax gain of $1.8 billion from the partial sale of the company's investments in cencora and full sale of investment in option care health in the current year.
interest expense, net was $580 million and $400 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of higher short-term benchmark interest rates and incremental facility borrowings associated with the summit transaction in the current period.
the company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 and 2022 was a benefit of 34.3% and 0.8%, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate benefit was primarily attributable to a reduction in the valuation allowance, changes to deferred taxes as a result of internal legal entity restructuring, and tax benefits related to a measurement change in prior year tax positions. these benefits were partially offset by the impact of certain nondeductible charges for opioid-related claims and litigation settlements recorded during fiscal 2023. the company recognized a tax benefit due to the reduction of a valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards. the reduction is primarily due to capital loss carryforwards utilized in the current year against capital gains recognized on the sale of shares in cencora and other forecasted capital gains. see note 6. equity method investments, to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii, item 8 for further information.
adjusted net earnings from continuing operations (non-gaap measure) fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
adjusted net earnings attributable to the company in fiscal 2023 decreased 21.1 percent to $3.4 billion compared with the year ago period. adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2023 decreased 20.9 percent to $3.98 compared with the year ago period. adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were both adversely impacted by 0.6 percentage points as a result of currency translation.
excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2023 primarily reflects a covid-19 headwind of approximately 21 percent and planned payroll investments in the u.s. retail pharmacy segment, partly offset by lower incentive accruals, improved retail contributions in the u.s., and international growth.

sales fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
sales for fiscal 2023 increased by 1.1 percent to $110.3 billion. comparable sales increased by 4.9 percent in fiscal 2023.
pharmacy sales increased by 2.1 percent in fiscal 2023, and represented 74.4 percent of the segment's sales. pharmacy sales were negatively impacted by a 3.5 percentage point headwind from alliancerx walgreens. in fiscal 2022, pharmacy sales decreased 5.3 percent and represented 73.7 percent of the segment's sales. comparable pharmacy sales increased 7.2 percent in fiscal 2023, aided by higher brand inflation and mix impacts, compared to an increase of 4.7 percent in the year ago period. within comparable pharmacy sales, 30-day equivalent prescriptions filled in fiscal 2023 increased by 0.6 percent compared to the year ago period. total prescriptions filled in fiscal 2023, including immunizations, adjusted to 30-day equivalents, decreased 0.4 percent to 1.2 billion, impacted by lower market growth.
retail sales decreased by 1.6 percent in fiscal 2023 and were 25.6 percent of the segment's sales. in comparison, fiscal 2022 retail sales increased by 5.6 percent and comprised 26.3 percent of the segment's sales. comparable retail sales decreased 0.8 percent in fiscal 2023 and increased 6.1 percent in fiscal 2022.
operating loss fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
gross profit was $22.1 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $23.7 billion in the year ago period. gross profit decreased 6.6 percent primarily driven by lower volumes of covid-19 vaccinations and testing volumes and pharmacy reimbursement pressure net of procurement savings, partly offset by improved retail gross profit driven by gross margin expansion and improved shrink.
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 25.1 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to 19.4 percent in fiscal 2022. the increase is primarily driven by the $6.8 billion pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation settlements, and planned payroll investments, partly offset by cost savings from the transformational cost management program and lower incentive accruals.
operating loss for fiscal 2023 was $5.3 billion, including income of $252 million from the company's share of equity earnings in cencora. this compared to $2.9 billion of operating income in the year ago period, including, $418 million from company's share of equity earnings in cencora. the decrease was primarily driven by a $6.8 billion pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation settlements, and lower gross profit.
adjusted operating income fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
adjusted operating income for fiscal 2023 decreased 26.6 percent to $3.7 billion. the decrease reflects a 23.7 percent headwind from lower covid-19 vaccination and testing volumes, softness in retail comparable sales and continued reimbursement pressure, partly offset by improved retail contributions, selling, general, and administrative expense discipline and lower inventive accruals.

international the company's international segment consists of pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses outside the u.s. and the company's pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution business in germany. pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses include boots branded stores in the uk, the republic of ireland and thailand, the benavides brand in mexico and the ahumada brand in chile. sales for these businesses are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and health and wellness, beauty, personal care and other consumer products.
the international segment operates in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including the british pound sterling, euro, chilean peso and mexican peso and therefore the segment's results are impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates. see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk, for further information on currency risk.
the company presents certain information related to operating results in "constant currency," which is a non-gaap financial measure. comparable sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency exclude the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. see "--non-gaap measures."

commitments and contingencies the information set forth in note 11. commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k is incorporated herein by reference.
critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. actual results may differ from these estimates. management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the consolidated statements of earnings and corresponding consolidated balance sheets accounts would be necessary. these adjustments would be made in future periods. some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, leases, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, long-lived assets impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and post-retirement benefits, contingencies and income taxes. the company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:
wba fiscal 2023 form 10-k business combinations - the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to non-controlling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.
for intangible assets, the company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.
although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.
judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset's useful life.
leases - the company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. the lease classification is determined at the commencement date. right-of-use assets represent the company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. lease commencement is the date the company has the right to control the property. the company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. the incremental borrowing rate is based on the company's estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term. the operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement, lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment. operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.
the lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there are significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the non-cancelable lease term, performance of the underlying store and the company's economic and strategic initiatives. short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets.
the company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. these are expensed as incurred. the company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability. other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. these fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. the company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building.
finance leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other non-current liabilities.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment - goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. as part of the company's impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using both the income and market approaches. the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping, as well as recent guideline transactions.
wba fiscal 2023 form 10-k the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the business and financial performance of the company's reporting units. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization, working capital requirements and capital expenditures. the company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the company's fair value as implied by the market value of its equity. this comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. future declines in the overall market value of the company's equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach. the determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangibles requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: forecasts of revenue, the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates.
although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as the company's profitability. the company continues to monitor these potential impacts and economic, industry and market trends, and the impact these may have on the reporting units.
impairment of long lived assets - the company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. the evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at the store level for retail pharmacy operations. long-lived assets related to the company's retail pharmacy operations include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangibles, and right of use assets. if the asset group fails the recoverability test, then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value. fair value of the asset group is generally determined using the income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group.
the determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.
cost of sales and inventory retail, pharmacy and wholesale cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts, vendor allowances and supplier rebates. cost of sales is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts.
the company values inventories on a lower of cost and net realizable value or market basis. inventories include product costs, inbound freight, direct labor, warehousing costs for retail pharmacy operations, and distribution costs of products, and are reduced by vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense. the company's u.s. retail pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out ("lifo") method. the company's international segment inventory is accounted for using average cost and the first-in-first-out ("fifo") method.
vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors' products. allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. allowances received for promoting vendors' products, if received for a specific, incremental, identifiable cost, are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. rebates or refunds received by the company from its suppliers, mostly in cash, are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the supplier's products purchased by the company.
wba fiscal 2023 form 10-k healthcare services for operations and activities related to the provision of healthcare, cost of services includes activities that are directly related to the provision of care, including medical claims expense, cost of care, clinic operating and support costs, and allocated depreciation and amortization.
medical claims expense represents medical claims expenses related to fee-for-service and value-based arrangements and primarily includes costs for third-party healthcare service providers, including contracted providers, that provide medical care to patients. medical claims expense and the liability for unpaid claims include estimates of the company's obligations for medical care services that have been rendered by third parties for which the company is contractually obligated to pay, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed or paid. the company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported ("ibnr") utilizing actuarial models when a sufficient amount of medical claims history is available from the third-party healthcare service providers. in developing its unpaid claims liability estimates, the company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated.
cost of care represents the cost of employed providers and certain affiliated providers, including base compensation, quality incentive bonuses, provider benefits and share-based compensation. clinic operating and support costs include costs incurred to operate clinics, including clinical care support staff, patient support staff, population health management employees, rent, utilities and supplies.
equity method investments - the company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. the company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings. judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the company's ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions.
the company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. factors considered by the company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. an impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.
pension and post-retirement benefits - the company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-u.s. employees. the company also has a post-retirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying u.s. employees. eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants' status, date of hire and or length of service. pension and post-retirement healthcare plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. these assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.
the company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. the post-retirement healthcare plan is not funded.
contingencies - the company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. with respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the company may be unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. the company's assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the company to change those estimates and assumptions. therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial statements in a future fiscal period. management's assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the company which are not presently known. adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to management's assessment of current liabilities and contingencies. accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved.
wba fiscal 2023 form 10-k income taxes -the company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. u.s. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the company's tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. in evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on the company's consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in its consolidated statements of earnings.
in determining its provision for income taxes, the company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. the provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the u.s. discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

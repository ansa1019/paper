item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with "selected consolidated financial data" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
a discussion of our financial performance for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 appears below under the captions "results of operations" and "liquidity and capital resources." a discussion of our financial performance for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 can be found under the same captions in item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, filed with the sec on february 7, 2023, which is available free of charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov and our investor relations website at investor.incyte.com/financial-information/annual-reports. these website addresses are intended to be inactive, textual references only. none of the materials on, or accessible through, these websites are part of this report or are incorporated by reference herein.
overview incyte is a global biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary therapeutics. we are focused in two therapeutic areas that are defined by the indications of our approved medicines and the diseases for which our clinical candidates are being developed. one therapeutic area is hematology/oncology, which comprises myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns), graft-versus-host disease (gvhd), solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. the other therapeutic area is inflammation and autoimmunity (iai), which includes our dermatology commercial franchise. we are also eligible to receive milestones and royalties on molecules discovered by us and licensed to third parties. our global headquarters is located in wilmington, delaware, where we conduct discovery, clinical development and commercial operations. we also conduct clinical development and commercial operations from our european headquarters in morges, switzerland and our other offices across europe, as well as our japanese office in tokyo and our canadian headquarters in montreal.
our portfolio focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and includes compounds in various stages, ranging from preclinical to late stage development, and commercialized products jakafi (ruxolitinib), iclusig (ponatinib), pemazyre (pemigatinib) and opzelura (ruxolitinib) cream, as well as minjuvi (tafasitamab) and monjuvi (tafasitamab-cxix), which prior to our february 2024 acquisition of global rights to tafasitamab, were co-commercialized, and zynyz (retifanlimab-dlwr).
our revenues depend on continued sales of our products, and we depend substantially on product revenues from jakafi. we must develop and commercialize new products to achieve revenue growth and to offset revenue losses from when products lose their exclusivity or when competing products are launched. for additional information, including information on the expirations of patents for various products, see part i, item 1 of this report, "business-patents and other intellectual property" and "business-competition." we devote substantial resources to research and development activities and to acquire rights to new product candidates and technologies, but successful product development in the biopharmaceutical industry is highly uncertain.
our product revenues also face challenges from economic conditions and drug pricing initiatives driven by governments and private payors. see part i, item 1a of this report, "risk factors" for a further discussion of certain factors that could impact our future product revenues.
regulatory achievements in march 2023, under our collaboration agreement with macrogenics, we received fda approval of zynyz for the treatment of adults with merkel cell carcinoma.
in april 2023, the european commission granted a marketing authorization for opzelura(ruxolitinib) cream 15mg/g for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age.
in september 2023, under our collaboration agreement with novartis, we received the regulatory approval of jakavi (ruxolitinib) in gvhd by the japanese ministry of health, labour and welfare.
in december 2023, the bla was submitted for axatilimab in chronic graft-versus-host disease for the treatment of patients with chronic gvhd after failure of two or more lines of systemic therapy.
license agreements, business relationships and acquisitions we establish business relationships, including collaborative arrangements with other companies and medical research institutions to assist in the clinical development and/or commercialization of certain of our drugs and drug candidates and to provide support for our research programs. we also establish business relationships with other companies and medical research institutions to acquire products or rights to products and technologies that are complementary to our business.
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. see note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a complete list of our significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition. we recognize revenue only when we have satisfied a performance obligation through transferring control of the promised good or service to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. we apply the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the company satisfies each performance obligation, which for the company is at a point in time. we also assess collectability based primarily on the customer's payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer.
product revenues our product revenues consist of sales of jakafi, opzelura, iclusig, pemazyre, minjuvi, and zynyz. product revenues are recognized once we satisfy the performance obligation at a point in time under the revenue recognition criteria as described above. we recognize revenues for product received by our customers net of allowances for customer credits, including estimated rebates, chargebacks, discounts, returns, distribution service fees, patient assistance programs, and government rebates, such as the medicaid drug rebate program and medicare part d coverage gap reimbursements in the united states. these sales allowances and accruals are recorded based on estimates which are described in detail below. estimates are assessed as of the end of each reporting period and are updated to reflect current information. we believe that our sales allowances and accruals are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. as of december 31, 2023, a 5% change in our sales allowance and accruals would have had an approximate $64.3 million impact on our income before taxes.
customer credits: our customers are offered various forms of consideration, including allowances, service fees and prompt payment discounts. we expect our customers will earn prompt payment discounts and, therefore, we deduct the full amount of these discounts from total product sales when revenues are recognized. service fees are also deducted from total product sales as they are earned.
rebates and discounts: we accrue rebates for mandated discounts under the medicaid drug rebate program in the united states and mandated discounts in europe in markets where government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare. these accruals are based on statutory discount rates and expected utilization as well as historical data we have accumulated since product launch.
in the fourth quarter of 2021 and fiscal year 2022 for non-covered patients of opzelura, we offered a full buy-down program as we were in the process of obtaining commercial insurance coverage for opzelura. during 2022, we contracted with the three largest group purchasing organizations to obtain coverage for opzelura. all full buy-down programs for opzelura ended effective january 31, 2023.
our estimates for expected utilization of commercial insurance rebates are based on data received from our customers. rebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter's activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters' unpaid rebates. if actual future rebates vary from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
chargebacks: chargebacks are discounts that occur when certain indirect contracted customers purchase directly from our wholesalers at a discounted price. the wholesalers, in turn, charges back to us the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesalers and the discounted price paid by the contracted customers. in addition to actual chargebacks received, we maintain an accrual for chargebacks based on the estimated contractual discounts on the inventory levels on hand in our distribution channel. if actual future chargebacks vary from these estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
medicare part d coverage gap: medicare part d prescription drug benefit mandates manufacturers to fund 70% of the medicare part d insurance coverage gap for prescription drugs sold to eligible patients. our estimates for the expected medicare part d coverage gap are based on historical invoices received and in part from data received from our customers. funding of the coverage gap is generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter's activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters. if actual future funding varies from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
co-payment assistance: patients who have commercial insurance and meet certain eligibility requirements may receive co-payment assistance. we accrue a liability for co-payment assistance based on actual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by third-party administrators. during the fourth quarter of 2021 and fiscal year 2022, we also offered a full buy-down program to non-covered patients of opzelura as we were obtaining commercial insurance coverage for opzelura. all full buy-down programs for opzelura ended effective january 31, 2023.
product royalty revenues royalty revenues on commercial sales for jakavi and tabrecta by novartis are estimated based on information provided by novartis. royalty revenues on commercial sales for olumiant by lilly are estimated based on information provided by lilly. royalty revenues on commercial sales for pemazyre by innovent are estimated based on information provided by innovent. we recognize royalty revenues in the period the sales occur. we exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon. if actual royalties vary from estimates, we may need to adjust the prior period, which would affect royalty revenue and receivable in the period of adjustment. historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual royalty revenues have not been material to our financial results and have been less than 1% of royalty revenues.
milestone and contract revenues at the inception of a contract, we determine the transaction price, in addition to any upfront payment, by estimating the amount of variable consideration, including milestone payments, at the outset of the contract utilizing the most likely amount method. our contractual milestones typically relate to the achievement of pre-specified development, regulatory and commercialization events outside of our control, such as regulatory approval of a compound, first patient dosing or achievement of sales-based thresholds. we include milestones in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the milestone is subsequently resolved. given the high level of uncertainty of achievement, variable consideration associated with milestones are fully constrained until confirmation of the satisfaction or completion of the milestone by the third-party. we review our estimate of the transaction price each period, and make revisions to such estimates as necessary.
stock compensation. share-based payment transactions with employees, which include stock options, restricted stock units (rsus) and performance shares (psus), are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their estimated fair values at the date of grant as well as expected forfeiture rates based on actual experience. the stock compensation process requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding black-scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility over the option term and expected option lives, as well as expected forfeiture rates and the probability of psus vesting. for the years ending december 31, 2023 and 2022, our black-scholes assumptions included a weighted-average stock price volatility of 32% in 2023 and 36% in 2022, average expected option life of approximately five years and an estimated annualized forfeiture rate of 5%. the average risk-free interest rate assumption used in the black-scholes valuations increased from 2.14% in 2022 to 4.01% in 2023.
the fair value of stock options, which are subject to graded vesting, are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. the fair value of rsus that are subject to cliff vesting are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line attribution method, and the fair value of rsus that are subject to graded vesting are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. the fair value of psus are recognized as compensation expense beginning at the time in which the performance conditions are deemed probable of achievement. we assess the probability of achievement of performance conditions, including projected product revenues and clinical development milestones, as of the end of each reporting period. once a performance condition is considered probable, we record compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to date with respect to that award, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize any remaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining requisite service period using the straight-line attribution method for psus that are subject to cliff vesting and using the accelerated attribution method for psus that are subject to graded vesting. compensation expense for psus with market performance conditions is calculated using a monte carlo simulation model as of the date of grant and recorded over the requisite service period.
income taxes. we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach to financial accounting for income taxes. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the basis differences are expected to reverse. we periodically assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets to an amount that is considered to be more-likely-than-not to be realizable. our assessment considers recent cumulative earnings experience, projections of future taxable income (losses) and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. when performing our assessment on projections of future taxable income (losses), we consider factors such as the likelihood of regulatory approval and commercial success of products currently under development, among other factors. significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent that a reversal of any portion of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is deemed appropriate, a tax benefit will be recognized against our income tax provision in the period of such reversal.
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefit that is recorded for these positions is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. any interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included within the tax provision.
we record estimates and prepare and file tax returns in various jurisdictions across the united states, canada, europe, and asia based upon our interpretation of local tax laws and regulations. while we exercise significant judgment when applying complex tax laws and regulations in these various taxing jurisdictions, many of our tax returns are open to audit, and may be subject to future tax, interest, and penalty assessments.
we believe our estimates for the valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits associated with uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements are appropriate based upon our assessment of the factors mentioned above. as a result of releasing the valuation allowance on the majority of our u.s. deferred tax assets in 2021, we expect that our reported income tax expense (current plus deferred) for future periods will be higher than that recorded for prior periods.

the increase in jakafi product revenues from 2022 to 2023 was comprised of a volume increase of $135.3 million and a price increase of $49.2 million. the increase in opzelura net product revenues from 2022 to 2023 was driven by growth in patient demand, refills and expansion in payer coverage as the launch in atopic dermatitis and vitiligo continues. our product revenues may fluctuate from period to period due to our customers' purchasing patterns over the course of a year, including as a result of increased inventory building by customers in advance of expected or announced price increases. product revenues are recorded net of sales allowances. our revenue recognition policies require estimates of the aforementioned sales allowances each period.
the following table provides a summary of activity with respect to our sales allowances and accruals (in thousands):

government rebates and chargebacks are the most significant component of our sales allowances. increases in certain government reimbursement rates are limited to a measure of inflation, and when the price of a drug increases faster than this measure of inflation it will result in a penalty adjustment factor that causes a larger sales allowance to those government related entities. we expect government rebates and chargebacks as a percentage of our gross product sales will continue to increase in connection with any future product price increases greater than the rate of inflation, and any such increase in these government rebates and chargebacks will have a negative impact on our reported product revenues, net. we adjust our estimates for government rebates and chargebacks based on new information regarding actual rebates as it becomes available.
we brought a lawsuit against the u.s. centers for medicare and medicaid services ("cms") alleging that a recent regulation issued by cms on the definition of "line extension" for purposes of the medicaid rebate program is too broad and has the unintended consequence of treating opzelura as a "line extension" of jakafi under this program. we believe that such a reading would violate cms's statutory authority and be arbitrary and capricious, given that opzelura, among other differentiators, is indicated to treat entirely different medical conditions and entirely different patient populations than jakafi. as of december 31, 2023, we have accrued approximately $59.5 million within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, relating to the incremental rebates that would be owed were opzelura considered a line extension of jakafi. the impact on opzelura gross to net deductions for the quarter ending december 31, 2023, is approximately 6.5%. if opzelura is not treated as a line extension of jakafi, this would result in a reversal of our accrual and a lower future gross to net deduction for opzelura.
claims by third-party payors for rebates and chargebacks are frequently submitted after the period in which the related sales occurred, which may result in adjustments to prior period accrual balances in the period in which the new information becomes available. our company-sponsored patient savings program in which we provide financial assistance to enable commercially-insured patients to afford their insurance premium and co-pays may fluctuate as the commercial insurance landscape evolves and may impact net revenues, particularly for drugs like opzelura. we also adjust our allowance for product returns based on new information regarding actual returns as it becomes available.
we expect our sales allowances to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the medicare part d coverage gap, the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates as well as changes in discount percentages which are impacted by potential future price increases, rate of inflation, and other factors.
product royalty revenues on commercial sales of jakavi and tabrecta by novartis are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by novartis. product royalty revenues on commercial sales of olumiant by lilly are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by lilly. the increase in olumiant product royalty revenues for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the corresponding period in 2022 includes unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. product royalty revenues on commercial sales of pemazyre by innovent are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by innovent.
our milestone and contract revenues were $7.0 million and $165.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2023, our milestone and contract revenues were primarily derived from a regulatory milestone under the novartis collaboration and license agreement. during the year ended december 31, 2022, our milestone and contract revenues were derived from total regulatory milestones achieved of $135.0 million, in addition to a $30.0 million upfront payment received upon our transfer of functional intellectual property to one of our collaboration partners.

total research and development expenses            $1,627.6                              $1,585.9
we account for research and development costs by natural expense line and not costs by project. salary and benefits related expense increased from 2022 to 2023 due primarily to increased development headcount to sustain our development pipeline. stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of awards granted, stock price volatility and expected award lives, as well as expected award forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation.
the decrease in clinical research and outside services expense from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in one-time collaboration related expenses. the increase in total research and development expense from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to continued investment in our late stage development assets. research and development expenses include upfront and milestone expenses related to our collaborative agreements and the asset acquisition of villaris in 2022, which were $36.7 million and $126.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. research and development expenses for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 were net of $49.1 million and $52.2 million, respectively, of costs reimbursed by our collaborative partners.
in addition to one-time expenses resulting from upfront fees in connection with the entry into any new or amended collaboration agreements and payment of milestones under those agreements, research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre-clinical and clinical trial related activities. many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials, including requests by regulatory agencies for more information, inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials, slow patient enrollment, adverse side effects among patients, insufficient supplies for our clinical trials, timing of drug supply, including api, and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our investigational drugs in our clinical trials. in addition, the development of all of our products will be subject to extensive governmental regulation. these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our products.

salary and benefits related expense increased from 2022 to 2023 due primarily to increased headcount. this increased headcount was due primarily to the establishment of our dermatology commercial organization. stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of awards granted, stock price volatility and expected award lives, as well as expected award forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation. the increase in other contract services and outside costs was primarily due to expenses related to promotional activities to support the launch of opzelura for the treatment of vitiligo.
loss on change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration acquisition-related contingent consideration, which consists of our future royalty obligations to ariad/takeda, was recorded on the acquisition date, june 1, 2016, at the estimated fair value of the obligation, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration is remeasured quarterly. the change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was expense of $29.2 million and $12.1 million, respectively, which is recorded in loss on change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration on the consolidated statements of operations. the loss on change in fair value of the contingent consideration during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was due primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impacting future revenue projections of iclusig and the passage of time.
(profit) and loss sharing under collaboration agreements under the now terminated collaboration and license agreement with morphosys, which was executed in march 2020, we and morphosys were both responsible for the commercialization efforts of tafasitamab in the united states and will share equally the profits and losses from the co-commercialization efforts. for the year ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, our 50% share of the costs for tafasitamab was $2.0 million and $8.0 million, respectively, as recorded in (profit) and loss sharing under collaboration agreements on the consolidated statement of operations. in february 2024, we entered into a purchase agreement with morphosys, as a result of which we now hold exclusive global rights for tafasitamab. see note 18 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information relating to this agreement.
interest income and other, net interest income and other, net. interest income and other, net, for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was $172.3 million and $39.9 million, respectively. the increase in interest income and other, net primarily relates to an increase in interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities generally due to higher interest rates.

provision for income taxes. the provision for income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was $236.6 million and $188.5 million, respectively.
our effective tax rate of 28.4% for the year ended december 31, 2023 decreased as compared to 35.6% for the prior year period primarily due to the dilution of the rate impact of foreign losses with no associated tax benefit, an increase in the tax rate benefits associated with research and development and orphan drug tax credits and a decrease in certain non-deductible expenses.
our effective tax rates for 2023 and 2022 were higher than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to foreign losses with no associated tax benefit (i.e., full valuation allowance) and an increase in our valuation allowance against certain u.s. federal and state deferred tax assets. this was partially offset by tax rate benefits associated with research and development and orphan drug tax credit generations and the foreign derived intangible income deduction.

sources and uses of cash.
at december 31, 2023, we had available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $3.7 billion. our cash and marketable securities balances are held in a variety of interest-bearing instruments, including money market accounts and u.s. government debt securities. available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy's primary objectives of liquidity, safety of principal and diversity of investments.
cash provided by operating activities. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from 2022 to 2023 was due primarily to changes in working capital.
cash used in investing activities. our investing activities, other than purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and purchases of long term investments. during 2023, net cash used in investing activities was $207.7 million, which represents purchases of marketable securities of $456.0 million, payments for intangible assets of $15.0 million, capital expenditures of $32.5 million, and purchases of long term investments of $10.0 million, offset in part by the sale and maturity of marketable securities of $305.8 million. during 2022, net cash used in investing activities was $78.5 million, which represents purchases of marketable securities of $79.9 million, capital expenditures of $77.8 million, offset in part by the sale and maturity of marketable securities of $79.2 million.
cash used in financing activities. during 2023, net cash used in financing activities was $20.0 million, and in 2022, net cash used in financing activities was $0.8 million, respectively, consisting primarily of cash paid to ariad/takeda for contingent consideration, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans net of tax withholdings.
our capital expenditures for construction activities and our non-operating contractual operating and finance lease obligations are discussed in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
in august 2021, we entered into a $500.0 million, three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which was subsequently amended in may 2023. we may increase the maximum revolving commitments or add one or more incremental term loan facilities, subject to obtaining commitments from any participating lenders and certain other conditions, in an amount not to exceed $250.0 million plus a contingent additional amount that is dependent on our pro forma consolidated leverage ratio. as of december 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings and were in compliance with all covenants under this facility. the amendment to the credit facility is discussed further in note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
due to the full utilization of our research and development and orphan drug tax credit carryforwards generated in prior years, our u.s. tax liabilities continue to reflect the adverse impacts of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses as required under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, which eliminated the immediate expensing of such expenses.
we believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds available under our revolving credit facility, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including our expenditures in connection with our drug discovery and development programs and commercialization operations; expenditures in connection with litigation or other legal proceedings; costs for future facility requirements; and expenditures for future strategic equity investments or potential acquisitions. we have entered into and may in the future seek to license additional rights relating to technologies or drug development candidates in connection with our drug discovery and development programs. under these licenses, we may be required to pay upfront fees, milestone payments, and royalties on sales of future products. these contingent future payments are discussed in detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
to the extent we seek to augment our existing cash resources and cash flow from operations to satisfy our cash requirements for future acquisitions or other strategic purposes, we expect that additional funding can be obtained through equity or debt financings or from other sources. the sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders, and may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our holders of common stock. debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness.

item 7 | executive overview item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" contained herein.
executive overview market conditions since early 2020, world-wide oil and natural gas supply and demand imbalances and related volatility of oil and natural gas prices (including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic) have resulted in dramatic fluctuations in oil and natural gas markets. the volatility continued in 2023 as markets were impacted by central bank rate hikes, macroeconomic uncertainty, non-opec supply growth, and renewed geopolitical unrest in the middle east. in the u.s., oil and natural gas production in 2023 remained elevated, despite a generally declining rig count, as a result of the industry's focus on efficiencies, higher service intensity, and high-quality acreage. lower commodity pricing and u.s. land rig counts generally contributed to softness in the market for energy products and services in north america, particularly in natural gas basins during the second half of 2023. conversely, the international rig count showed steady growth in 2023 largely driven by national oil companies (nocs) in the middle east/asia and africa.
globally, we continue to be impacted by increased supply chain lead times for the supply of select raw materials. we monitor market trends and work to mitigate cost impacts through economies of scale in global procurement, technology modifications, and efficient sourcing practices. also, while we have been impacted by inflationary cost increases, primarily related to chemicals, cement, and logistics costs, we generally try to pass much of those increases on to our customers and we believe we have effective solutions to minimize their operational impact.
financial results the following graph illustrates our revenue and operating margins for each operating segment over the past three years.
during 2023, we generated total company revenue of $23.0 billion, a 13% increase from the $20.3 billion of revenue generated in 2022, with our completion and production (c&p) segment revenue increasing by 18% and our drilling and evaluation (d&e) segment revenue increasing by 7%. we reported total company operating income of approximately $4.1 billion in 2023, compared to operating income of $2.7 billion in 2022. these increases were driven by increased demand for our products and services in all four of our geographic regions.
our north america revenue increased 9% in 2023 compared to 2022, despite a 4% decrease in average rig count from 2022, resulting from higher pressure pumping and artificial lift activity in north america land, increased completion tool sales in the gulf of mexico, and improved fluid and wireline services across the region.
internationally, revenue improved 17% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher activity for drilling and completions related services in latin america, africa, and the middle east/asia, which was partially offset by our exit from russia in the third quarter of 2022. the international average rig count for 2023 increased 11% compared to 2022.

item 7 | executive overview our operating performance and liquidity are described in more detail in "liquidity and capital resources" and "business environment and results of operations."
sustainability and energy mix transition in the first quarter of 2021, we announced our target to achieve a 40% reduction in our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035 from the 2018 baseline. during 2023, we continued to execute on priorities we set up to help us progress toward our 2035 emissions reduction target. as our customers have begun to invest more in emissions reduction, we have developed or are developing solutions intended to reduce our own carbon footprint while advancing our customers' decarbonization efforts. as the energy mix transition unfolds, we seek to apply our expertise and products and services across different parts of the energy value chain. we have also applied our experience and resources in sectors adjacent to our traditional oilfield services space, including carbon capture, utilization, and storage, hydrogen, and geothermal. finally, we will continue to focus on accelerating the success of clean tech start-ups via halliburton labs. as of december 31, 2023, halliburton labs had 32 participating companies and alumni. halliburton labs allows us to participate in the energy mix transition at relatively low risk by investing our expertise, resources, and team without a significant outlay of capital.
our sustainability efforts were recognized in 2023 as we were named to the dow jones sustainability north america index for the third consecutive year. the djsi assesses the sustainability performances of companies using a transparent, rules-based process based on the annual s&p global corporate sustainability assessment (csa), among its industry peers.
additionally, we published our 2022 annual and sustainability report (asr) in april of 2023, which details our strategy and progress on sustainability issues, as well as our efforts on increased environmental reporting transparency, including conducting a climate-risk scenario analysis. information on our website, including the asr, is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k.

item 7 | liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources we had $2.3 billion of cash and equivalents as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively.
significant sources and uses of cash in 2023
sources of cash:
•cash flows from operating activities were $3.5 billion. working capital, which consists of receivables, inventories, and accounts payable, collectively had a negative impact of $511 million, primarily due to increased receivables and inventory.
uses of cash:
•capital expenditures were $1.4 billion.
•we repurchased 22.7 million shares of our common stock for $800 million.
•we paid $576 million of dividends to our shareholders.
•we repurchased $300 million aggregate principal amounts of various series of our outstanding debt.
future sources and uses of cash we manufacture most of our own equipment, which provides us with some flexibility to increase or decrease our capital expenditures based on market conditions. we currently expect capital spending for 2024 to be approximately 6% of revenue. we believe this level of spend will allow us to invest in our key strategic technologies, including the construction and deployment of our zeus electric fracturing systems in north america, our istar intelligent drilling and logging platform, and our icruise intelligent rotary steerable system. we will continue to maintain capital discipline and monitor the rapidly changing market dynamics, and we may adjust our capital spend accordingly.
in 2024, we expect to pay approximately $518 million for contractual purchase obligations (with another $211 million due through 2026), $397 million of interest on debt, and $391 million under our leasing arrangements. payments for interest on our debt arrangements are expected to remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future. see note 6 and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on expected future payments under our leasing arrangements and debt maturities.
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, in part because we are unable to predict the timing of potential tax settlements with applicable taxing authorities. as of december 31, 2023, we had $268 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding penalties and interest, of which we estimate $235 million may require us to make a cash payment. we estimate that approximately $158 million of the cash payment will not be settled within the next 12 months.
while we maintain focus on liquidity and debt reduction, we are also focused on providing cash returns to our shareholders. in january of 2023, our board approved a capital return framework with a goal of returning at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. we returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders in 2023 through buybacks and dividends. during 2023, our quarterly dividend rate was $0.16 per common share, or approximately $144 million in the aggregate. in january 2024, we announced that our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.17 per common share for the first quarter of 2024, or approximately $152 million in the aggregate.
we may utilize share repurchases as part of our capital return framework. our board of directors has authorized a program to repurchase our common stock from time to time. we repurchased 22.7 million shares of common stock during the year ended december 31, 2023. approximately $4.1 billion remained authorized for repurchases under our program as of december 31, 2023 and may be used for open market and other share purchases.
during the second quarter of 2023, we began our migration to sap s4 which we expect to complete by the end of 2025. the migration is estimated to cost approximately $250 million, of which we have incurred $51 million through december 31, 2023. for 2024, we expect to spend approximately $120 million. we believe the new system will enhance visibility to our operations and provide important efficiency benefits, cost savings, and advanced analytics that will benefit us and our customers.
we do not intend to incur additional debt in 2024, as we believe our cash on hand and earnings from operations are sufficient to cover our obligations for the year.

item 7 | liquidity and capital resources other factors affecting liquidity financial position in current market. as of december 31, 2023, we had $2.3 billion of cash and equivalents and $3.5 billion of available committed bank credit under a revolving credit facility with an expiration date of april 27, 2027. we believe we have a manageable debt maturity profile, with approximately $472 million coming due beginning in 2025 through 2027. furthermore, we have no financial covenants or material adverse change provisions in our bank agreements, and our debt maturities extend over a long period of time. we believe our cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations, and our available credit facility provide sufficient liquidity to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market and our expected global cash needs for 2024, including capital expenditures, working capital investments, shareholder returns, if any, and debt repurchases, if any, and scheduled interest and principal payments.
guarantee agreements. in the normal course of business, we have agreements with financial institutions under which approximately $2.6 billion letters of credit, bank guarantees, or surety bonds were outstanding as of december 31, 2023. some of the outstanding letters of credit have triggering events that would entitle a bank to require cash collateralization, however, none of these triggering events have occurred. as of december 31, 2023, we had no material off-balance sheet liabilities and were not required to make any material cash distributions to our unconsolidated subsidiaries.
during the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into a credit default swap ("cds") with a third-party financial institution. the notional amount of the cds, which was $300 million at the end of january 2024, will reduce on a monthly basis over its 26-month term. the cds relates to a borrowing provided by the financial institution to one of our primary customers in mexico, a portion of the proceeds of which was utilized by this customer to pay certain of our outstanding receivables.
credit ratings. our credit ratings with standard & poor's (s&p) remained bbb+ for our long-term debt and a-2 for our short-term debt, with an upgrade to positive outlook from stable outlook in november 2023. during the third quarter of 2023, our long-term debt rating with moody's investors service (moody's) was upgraded to a3 from baa1 and the short-term debt rating remained p-2, with a stable outlook. as of the end of the year our long-term debt rating with moody's remained a3 and short-term debt rating remained p-2, with a stable outlook.
customer receivables. in line with industry practice, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures to pay our invoices due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers' cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets, as well as unsettled political conditions.
receivables from our primary customer in mexico accounted for approximately 6% of our total receivables as of december 31, 2023. while we have experienced payment delays from our primary customer in mexico, these amounts are not in dispute and we have not historically had, and we do not expect to have, any material write-offs due to collectability of receivables from this customer.

item 7 | business environment and results of operations business environment and results of operations we operate in more than 70 countries throughout the world to provide a comprehensive range of services and products to the energy industry. our revenue is generated from the sale of services and products to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide. the industry we serve is highly competitive with many substantial competitors in each segment of our business. in 2023, 2022, and 2021, based on the location of services provided and products sold, 44%, 45%, and 40%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was from the united states. no other country accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.
activity within our business segments is significantly impacted by spending on upstream exploration, development, and production programs by our customers. also impacting our activity is the status of the global economy, which impacts oil and natural gas consumption.
some of the more significant determinants of current and future spending levels of our customers are oil and natural gas prices and our customers' expectations about future prices, global oil supply and demand, completions intensity, the world economy, the availability of capital, government regulation, and global stability, which together drive worldwide drilling and completions activity. lower oil and natural gas prices usually translate into lower exploration and production budgets and lower rig count, while the opposite is usually true for higher oil and natural gas prices. our financial performance is therefore significantly affected by oil and natural gas prices and worldwide rig activity, which are summarized in the tables below.
the table below shows the average prices for west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil, united kingdom brent crude oil, and henry hub natural gas.

item 7 | business environment and results of operations business outlook looking ahead, we expect oil and natural gas demand to continue to grow over the next several years as easing inflationary pressures across the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) countries increase the likelihood for central bank rate cuts, abating fears of a macroeconomic slowdown. we believe long-term expansion of the global economy will continue to increase demands on all forms of energy. we expect oil and natural gas remains a critical component of the global energy mix. the international energy agency's december 2023 "oil market report" forecasts 2024 global oil demand to reach 102.7 million barrels per day, an increase of 1% from 2023.
we believe that oil demand growth will be driven by resilient global economic growth and increases in transportation activity. in addition, we think oil supply dynamics have fundamentally changed due to, among other things, investor return requirements, and regulatory initiatives adverse to oil and natural gas exploration and production and that promote alternative energy, any of which could limit supply growth. we believe that despite the changes in oil supply dynamics, increased investment in existing and new sources of production is the only solution to increase supply and that production will be needed from conventional and unconventional, deep-water and shallow-water, and short and long-cycle projects. we expect that increased production requirements will in turn create demand for our products and services.
internationally, we expect oil and natural gas exploration and production activity to grow during 2024. although we anticipate regional differences in growth rates for 2024, we believe the middle east/asia regions will likely experience the greatest increases in activity, with other regions closely behind. we expect growth in both onshore and offshore markets, as well as services related to carbon capture, utilization, and storage. the "short term energy outlook" published by the united states energy information administration (eia) predicts that u.s. oil production will average 13.1 million barrels per day in 2024, an increase of 1% as compared to 2023. as a result, we expect stable exploration and production activity levels in the u.s.

n/m = not meaningful operating segments completion and production completion and production revenue was $13.7 billion in 2023, an increase of $2.1 billion, or 18%, compared to 2022. operating income was $2.8 billion in 2023, a 39% increase from $2.0 billion in 2022. these results were primarily driven by higher pressure pumping activity in north america land, as well as improved completion tool sales globally. partially offsetting these increases was decreased activity in russia due to our exit from the country.
drilling and evaluation drilling and evaluation revenue was $9.3 billion in 2023, an increase of $614 million, or 7%, from 2022. operating income was $1.5 billion in 2023, an increase of $251 million, or 19%, compared to 2022. these results were primarily attributable to increased fluid services and drilling activity globally and higher wireline activity in the western hemisphere, africa, and the middle east/asia. partially offsetting these increases were decreased activity in russia due to our exit from the country and lower project management activity in saudi arabia.
geographic regions north america north america revenue was $10.5 billion in 2023, a 9% increase compared to 2022, resulting from improved pressure pumping and artificial lift activity in north america land, increased fluid and wireline services across the region, and higher completion tool sales in the gulf of mexico. partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related activity and decreased well intervention services in north america land.

item 7 | results of operations in 2023 compared to 2022
latin america latin america revenue was $4.0 billion in 2023, a 25% increase compared to 2022, resulting from improvements across multiple product service lines in brazil, mexico, and argentina. partly offsetting these increases was lower project management activity in the caribbean, ecuador, and colombia.
europe/africa/cis europe/africa/cis revenue was $2.9 billion in 2023, a 6% increase compared to 2022, resulting from increased activity across multiple product service lines in africa and higher drilling-related services in norway. partially offsetting these increases were the sale of our russian operations during the third quarter of 2022, as well as decreased wireline activity, lower completion tool sales and decreased testing services in norway, and lower drilling-related activity and decreased testing services in algeria.
middle east/asia middle east/asia revenue was $5.7 billion in 2023, an 18% increase compared to 2022, resulting from increased activity across multiple product service lines in saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, qatar, indonesia, and malaysia, and higher drilling services and improved wireline activity in thailand. partially offsetting these improvements were lower project management activity in saudi arabia and lower stimulation activity and decreased well intervention services in kuwait.
other operating items impairments and other charges. during 2023, there were no amounts recorded in impairment and other charges. during 2022, we recognized $366 million of charges, primarily related to a $344 million write down of all our net assets in russia as a result of our decision to sell our russia operations due to the sanctions enacted against russia arising from the conflict in ukraine. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on these charges.
sap s4 upgrade expense. as previously mentioned, in the second quarter of 2023 we began our migration to sap s4, which we expect to complete by the end of 2025. in 2023, we recognized $51 million of expense on our sap s4 migration.
nonoperating items argentina blue chip swap. the central bank of argentina maintains currency controls that limit our ability to access u.s. dollars in argentina and remit cash from our argentine operations. the execution of certain trades known as blue chip swaps, effectively results in a parallel u.s. dollar exchange rate. this parallel rate, which cannot be used as the basis to remeasure our net monetary assets in u.s. dollars under u.s. gaap, was 20% higher than argentina's official exchange rate at december 31, 2023. for the year ended december 31, 2023, we entered into blue chip swap transactions, which resulted in a $110 million pre-tax loss on investment.
argentina currency impact. argentina devalued its peso by more than 50% during december 2023. consequently, we incurred a loss of $131 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 due to the devaluation of the currency in argentina.
loss on early extinguishment of debt. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded a $42 million loss on the early redemption of $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.8% senior notes due november 2025, which included premiums and unamortized expenses. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
income tax provision. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recorded a total income tax provision of $701 million on pre-tax income of $3.4 billion, resulting in an effective tax rate of 20.8%. the effective tax rate for 2023 was primarily impacted by our geographic mix of earnings, tax adjustments related to the reassessment of prior year tax accruals, and changes of valuation allowance on some of our deferred tax assets. during 2022, we recorded a total income tax provision of $515 million on pre-tax income of $2.1 billion, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.4%. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for significant drivers of these tax provisions.

item 7 | results of operations in 2023 compared to 2022
pillar two. the oecd recently enacted model rules for a new global minimum tax framework, also known as pillar two, and certain governments globally have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, legislation considering these model rules. we have considered the possible implication of the legislation passed or in consideration of being passed, and we do not believe these rules will have a material impact on our taxes in the near future.
internal revenue service notice of proposed adjustment. we are subject to taxes in the united states and in numerous jurisdictions where we operate or where our subsidiaries are organized. our tax returns are routinely subject to examination by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we file tax returns. in most cases we are no longer subject to examination by tax authorities for years before 2012. the only significant operating jurisdiction that has tax filings under review or subject to examination by the tax authorities is the united states. our united states federal income tax filings for tax years 2016 through 2022, including carry back of 2016 net operating losses to 2014, are currently under review or remain open for review by the internal revenue service (the irs).
on september 28, 2023, we received a notice of proposed adjustment (nopa) from the irs covering our 2016 us tax return. the nopa proposed an adjustment to reclassify approximately 95% of the $3.5 billion termination fee paid to baker hughes in 2016 from an ordinary expense deduction to a capital loss. the termination fee was paid to baker hughes under the merger agreement after antitrust regulators in multiple jurisdictions failed to approve our proposed merger. it is common commercial practice to include a termination fee in a merger agreement to compensate the target for damages incurred when the acquisition does not go forward. the irs's long-understood position at the time of the payment had been to treat such payments as an ordinary and necessary business expense. we strongly disagree with the proposed adjustment on both a factual and legal basis, and we plan to vigorously contest it.
we expect that resolving this dispute will take substantial time. in december 2023, we initiated the irs administrative appeals process, which may take more than 12 months to complete. failing a resolution through that process, the matter would ultimately be resolved by the united states federal courts.
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves, and we believe our income tax reserves are appropriately provided for all open tax years. we cannot assure you that the matter will be determined in our favor or against us, and if the matter is ultimately determined unfavorably to us, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. based on tax attributes currently available, we estimate that, should the irs's position prevail through its appellate process and subsequent litigation, the proposed adjustment could result in cash taxes due of approximately $650 million (plus interest thereon in the case of amounts due for previous tax years). our estimates are calculated under current tax law and on the bases of our assumptions regarding taxable income and loss and other tax attributes over the relevant period, which law could change and which assumptions could and likely will differ materially from actual results. in any event, no payment of any additional tax is currently required, nor do we anticipate that the proposed adjustment would materially and adversely impact our ability to meet our expected uses of cash, including future capital expenditures, working capital investments, and scheduled debt repayments, or our ability to return cash to shareholders, even if a final determination of the matter is reached that is adverse to us.

item 7 | critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates. our critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how we develop our assumptions and judgments about future events and related estimates and how they can impact our financial statements. a critical accounting estimate is one that requires our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments and assessments and is fundamental to our results of operations. we identified our most critical accounting estimates to be:
-    forecasting our income tax (provision) benefit, including our future ability to utilize foreign tax credits and the realizability of deferred tax assets (including net operating loss carryforwards), and providing for uncertain tax positions;
-    legal and investigation matters;
-    valuations of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and goodwill; and
-    allowance for credit losses.
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. we believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as well as the significant estimates and judgments affecting the application of these policies. this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.
income tax accounting we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and use an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. we apply the following basic principles in accounting for our income taxes:
-    a current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year;
-    a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards;
-    the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of the enacted tax law, and the effects of potential future changes in tax laws or rates are not considered; and
-    the value of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
we determine deferred taxes separately for each tax-paying component (an entity or a group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. that determination includes the following procedures:
-    identifying the types and amounts of existing temporary differences;
-    measuring the total deferred tax liability for taxable temporary differences using the applicable tax rate;
-    measuring the total deferred tax asset for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards using the applicable tax rate;
-    measuring the deferred tax assets for each type of tax credit carryforward; and
-    reducing the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
our methodology for recording income taxes requires a significant amount of judgment and the use of assumptions and estimates. additionally, we use forecasts of certain tax elements, such as taxable income and foreign tax credit utilization, as well as evaluate the feasibility of implementing tax planning strategies. given the inherent uncertainty involved with the use of such variables, there can be significant variation between anticipated and actual results that could have a material impact on our income tax accounts related to continuing operations.

item 7 | critical accounting estimates we have operations in more than 70 countries. consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities. the income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases, including net income actually earned, net income deemed earned, and revenue-based tax withholding. our tax filings are routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax authorities. the final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties and related authorities in each jurisdiction, as well as the significant use of estimates and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved, the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred. the final determination of tax audits or changes in the operating environment, including changes in tax law and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year and have an adverse effect on our financial statements. for example, we received a nopa from the irs on september 28, 2023. see "managements's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - nonoperating items, internal revenue service notice of proposed adjustment" and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
tax filings of our subsidiaries, unconsolidated affiliates and related entities are routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax authorities. these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, which we work to resolve with the tax authorities and through the judicial process. predicting the outcome of disputed assessments involves some uncertainty. factors such as the availability of settlement procedures, willingness of tax authorities to negotiate, and the operation and impartiality of judicial systems vary across the different tax jurisdictions and may significantly influence the ultimate outcome. we review the facts for each assessment, and then utilize assumptions and estimates to determine the most likely outcome and provide taxes, interest, and penalties, as needed based on this outcome. we provide for uncertain tax positions pursuant to current accounting standards, which prescribe a minimum recognition threshold and measurement methodology that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. the standards also provide guidance for derecognition classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
legal and investigation matters as discussed in note 11 of our consolidated financial statements, we are subject to various legal and investigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. as of december 31, 2023, we have accrued an estimate of the probable and estimable costs for the resolution of some of our legal and investigation matters, which is not material to our consolidated financial statements. for other matters for which the liability is not probable and reasonably estimable, we have not accrued any amounts. attorneys in our legal department monitor and manage all claims filed against us and review all pending investigations. generally, the estimate of probable costs related to these matters is developed in consultation with internal and outside legal counsel representing us. our estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. the accuracy of these estimates is impacted by, among other things, the complexity of the issues and the amount of due diligence we have been able to perform. we attempt to resolve these matters through settlements, mediation, and arbitration proceedings when possible. if the actual settlement costs, final judgments, or fines, after appeals, differ from our estimates, there may be a material adverse effect on our future financial results. we have in the past recorded significant adjustments to our initial estimates of these types of contingencies.
value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and goodwill we carry a variety of long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property, plant, and equipment, goodwill, and other intangibles. impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, and any impairment charge that we record reduces our operating income. goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. we conduct impairment tests on goodwill annually, during the third quarter, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. we conduct impairment tests on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
when conducting an impairment test on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, we first group individual assets based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets. this requires some judgment. we then compare estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to its carrying amount. if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying amount, we then determine the asset group's fair value by using a discounted cash flow analysis. this analysis is based on estimates such as management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance, including revenue growth rates and expected profitability margins, estimates of the remaining useful life and service potential of the assets within the asset group, and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital. an impairment loss is measured and recorded as the amount by which the asset group's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of impairments and other charges.

item 7 | critical accounting estimates we perform our goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit, which is the same as our reportable segments, the completion and production division and the drilling and evaluation division, comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill. we estimate the fair value for each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance. this analysis includes significant assumptions regarding discount rates, revenue growth rates, expected profitability margins, forecasted capital expenditures, and the timing of expected future cash flows based on market conditions. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recorded.
the impairment assessments discussed above incorporate inherent uncertainties, including projected commodity pricing, supply and demand for our services, and future market conditions, which are difficult to predict in volatile economic environments and could result in impairment charges in future periods if actual results materially differ from the estimated assumptions utilized in our forecasts. if market conditions deteriorate, including crude oil prices significantly declining and remaining at low levels for a sustained period of time, we could be required to record additional impairments of the carrying value of our long-lived assets in the future which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies related to long-lived assets.
allowance for credit losses we evaluate our global accounts receivable through a continuous process of assessing our portfolio on an individual customer and overall basis. this process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, financial condition of our customers, and whether the receivables involve retainages. we also consider the economic environment of our customers, both from a marketplace and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for an allowance. based on our review of these factors, we establish or adjust allowances for specific customers. this process involves judgment and estimation, and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. accordingly, our results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance due to actual write-offs that differ from estimated amounts.
at december 31, 2023, our allowance for credit losses totaled $742 million, or 13.9% of notes and accounts receivable before the allowance. at december 31, 2022, our allowance for credit losses totaled $731 million, or 14.7% of notes and accounts receivable before the allowance. the allowance for credit losses in both years is primarily comprised of accounts receivable from our primary customer in venezuela. a hypothetical 100 basis point change in our estimate of the collectability of our notes and accounts receivable balance as of december 31, 2023 would have resulted in a $54 million adjustment to 2023 total operating costs and expenses. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
financial instrument market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we selectively manage these exposures through the use of derivative instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange options, and interest rate swaps. the objective of our risk management strategy is to minimize the volatility from fluctuations in foreign currency and interest rates. we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. the counterparties to our forward contracts, options, and interest rate swaps are global commercial and investment banks.
we use a sensitivity analysis model to measure the impact of potential adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. with respect to foreign exchange sensitivity, after consideration of the impact from our forward foreign exchange contracts and options, a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of all our foreign currency positions relative to the united states dollar as of december 31, 2023 would result in a $85 million, pre-tax loss for our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than united states dollars. as of december 31, 2023, we did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding and our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates.
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates and interest rates change instantaneously in an equally adverse fashion. in addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. while this is our best estimate of the impact of the various scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts.

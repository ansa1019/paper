the following md&a is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information. it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8, as well as other information contained in this document.
non-gaap financial measures this document contains non-gaap financial measures denoted as "underlying" results and "including aoci impact." underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which management does not consider indicative of our on-going financial performance. we believe these non-gaap financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. in addition, we believe our underlying results in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance in that period and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our gaap financial results. we further believe the presentation of underlying results increases comparability of period-to-period results.
other companies may use similarly titled non-gaap financial measures that may be calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. accordingly, our non-gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. we caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-gaap financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable gaap measures. non-gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under gaap.
non-gaap measures are denoted throughout our md&a by the use of the term "underlying." where there is a reference to these metrics in that paragraph, all measures that follow are on the same basis when applicable. for more information on the computation of non-gaap financial measures, see "non-gaap financial measures and reconciliations."

results of operations - 2023 compared with 2022
net interest income net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (generally loans, leases and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits and borrowed funds). the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on our average interest-earning assets and the effective cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates. for further discussion, refer to "market risk - non-trading risk" and "risk governance."

the primary drivers for the change in noninterest income for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to 2022, are highlighted below.
•the decline in capital markets fees reflects lower loan syndication, underwriting and m&a advisory fees.
•mortgage banking fees declined driven by lower production and servicing fees and a decline in msr valuation, net of hedge impact.
•the decline in service charges and fees reflects the elimination of the non-sufficient funds fee in consumer banking.
•card fees increased given higher transaction volumes.
•trust and investment services fees reflect increased sales activity and asset management fees.

the increase in noninterest expense for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to 2022, was driven by salaries and employee benefits reflecting the private bank start-up investment, equipment and software driven by software maintenance and amortization costs, and other operating expense associated with fdic deposit insurance, fraud losses, advertising, and pension costs. the increase in fdic deposit insurance reflects cbna's special assessment of $225 million and an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate of two basis points that commenced with the first quarterly assessment period in 2023. for more information regarding cbna's special assessment, see "regulation and supervision - deposit insurance" in item 1.

provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate our acl. the total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. refer to "analysis of financial condition - credit quality" for more information.
provision expense of $687 million for 2023 compares to $474 million for 2022. the provision expense for 2023 reflects higher reserves against the commercial real estate office portfolio primarily driven by rising interest rates and return to office dynamics.
income tax expense income tax expense of $422 million decreased $160 million and our effective income tax rate of 20.8% decreased from 21.9% compared to 2022. these decreases were driven by lower pre-tax income, the favorable impact of certain tax matters and additional benefits from tax-advantaged investments, partially offset by the adoption of the proportional amortization method for qualified investments in tax credit structures in 2023 and increased non-deductible fdic premium expense.
business operating segments we have three business operating segments: consumer banking, commercial banking, and non-core. during the third quarter of 2023, our indirect auto and certain purchased consumer loan portfolios were transferred from the consumer banking segment into a new non-core segment to reflect the manner in which management is currently assessing performance and allocating resources. this new segment structure aligns with our recently announced balance sheet optimization strategy to discontinue the origination of certain non-strategic lending portfolios. prior period results have been revised to conform to the new segment presentation.
for more information regarding our business operating segments see note 26.
the following table presents certain financial data of our business operating segments. total business operating segment financial results differ from total consolidated financial results. these differences are reflected in other non-segment operations. see note 26 for additional information.

consumer banking net interest income increased $538 million compared to 2022, driven by higher net interest margin reflecting higher interest-earning asset yields given higher market interest rates and growth in average interest-earning assets, including the impacts of the hsbc transaction and investors acquisition. this increase was partially offset by higher funding costs.

noninterest income increased $4 million compared to 2022, driven by card fees given higher transaction volumes and trust and investment services fees reflecting increased sales activity and asset management fees. this increase was partially offset by mortgage banking fees reflecting lower servicing and production fees and a decline in msr valuation, net of hedge impact, and service charges and fees given the elimination of the non-sufficient funds fees.
noninterest expense increased $287 million compared to 2022, driven by salaries and benefits reflecting the private bank start-up investment, equipment and software driven by software maintenance and amortization costs, and other operating expense associated with advertising and fraud losses.
net charge-offs increased $106 million compared to 2022, driven by other retail and education as credit losses continue to gradually normalize from pandemic-era lows.
commercial banking net interest income increased $189 million compared to 2022, driven by higher net interest margin reflecting higher interest-earning asset yields given higher market interest rates and growth in average interest-earning assets, including the impact of the investors acquisition. this increase was partially offset by higher funding costs.
noninterest income decreased $61 million compared to 2022, driven by capital markets fees reflecting lower loan syndication, underwriting and m&a advisory fees, and foreign exchange and derivative products revenue reflecting lower client hedging activity. this decline was partially offset by service charges and fees reflecting the benefit of acquisitions and improvement in treasury solutions fees and card fees given higher transaction volumes.
noninterest expense increased $72 million compared to 2022, driven primarily by salaries and employee benefits, and equipment and software driven by software maintenance and amortization costs.
net charge-offs increased $204 million compared to 2022, reflecting an increased net charge-off level in the commercial real estate office portfolio primarily driven by rising interest rates and return to office dynamics, and the normalization of credit losses from pandemic-era lows.
non-core net interest income decreased $507 million compared to 2022, driven by the highest-cost implied marginal funding sources during 2023, including secured borrowings collateralized by auto loans, fhlb advances and, to the extent necessary to fully fund the non-core segment, brokered certificates of deposit.
net charge-offs increased $26 million compared to 2022, driven by auto as credit losses continue to gradually normalize from pandemic-era lows.

(2) included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
the primary objective of the securities portfolio is to provide a ready source of liquidity. the portfolio primarily includes high quality, highly liquid investments reflecting our ongoing commitment to maintain strong contingent liquidity levels and pledging capacity.
as of december 31, 2023, u.s. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities issued by gnma and gses represent 96% of the fair value of our debt securities portfolio, with approximately $31.4 billion of unencumbered high-quality liquid securities serving as potential collateral for borrowings from the fhlb, frb discount window, the fixed income clearing corporation bilateral repurchase agreement market, and the bank term funding program. the bank term funding program expires in march 2024 and we have not participated in this program through december 31, 2023. securities are pledged at par value instead of fair value under this program.
for further discussion of the use of our securities as liquidity collateral see the "regulation and supervision - liquidity requirements" and "liquidity risk management and governance" sections in this document.
we manage our securities portfolio duration and convexity risk through asset selection and securities structure, and maintain duration levels within our risk appetite in the context of the broader interest rate risk framework and limits. as of december 31, 2023, the portfolio's average effective duration, including recent hedging actions to reduce duration, was 3.9 years compared to 5.8 years as of december 31, 2022.

(1) actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without incurring penalties.
(2) the weighted-average yield is computed based on a constant effective interest rate over the contractual life of each security and considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. yields exclude the impact of related hedging derivatives.

the decrease in total loans and leases as of december 31, 2023 compared to december 31, 2022 reflects a $7.7 billion decrease in commercial due to loans sold as part of balance sheet optimization actions and market conditions driving lower client demand. retail declined $3.0 billion, driven by planned non-core portfolio runoff in auto, education and other retail, partially offset by growth in mortgage and home equity.

retail loan asset quality we utilize credit scores provided by fico, which are generally refreshed on a quarterly basis, and payment and delinquency status, among other data points, to monitor credit quality for retail loans. fico credit scores represent current and historical national industry-wide consumer level credit performance data, which management believes are the strongest indicator of potential credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and a good predictor of a borrower's future payment performance.

capital and regulatory matters as a bhc and fhc, we are subject to regulation and supervision by the frb. our banking subsidiary, cbna, is a national banking association primarily regulated by the occ. our regulation and supervision continues to evolve as the legal and regulatory frameworks governing our operations continue to change. for more information, see the "regulation and supervision" section in item 1.
capital adequacy process our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our board-approved risk appetite and risk management framework. this framework provides for the identification, measurement and management of material risks. capital requirements are determined for actual and forecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies. the assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. key analytical frameworks, including scenario analysis and stress testing, supplement our base line forecast to help inform a range of potential outcomes. a governance framework supports our capital planning process, including capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits, as well as our capital contingency plan and the active engagement of both the board and senior management in oversight and decision-making.
forward-looking assessments of capital adequacy provide for the development of a single capital plan, which is periodically submitted to the frb, that covers both us and our banking subsidiary. we prepare this plan in accordance with the capital plan rule and we participate annually in the frb's horizontal capital review as part of their normal supervisory process, which includes an assessment of specific capital planning areas.
the frb regularly supervises and evaluates our capital adequacy and capital planning processes, including the submission of an annual capital plan approved by our board of directors or one of its committees. under the frb's capital requirements we must maintain capital ratios above the sum of the regulatory minimum and scb requirement to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. the frb utilizes the supervisory stress test to determine our scb, which is re-calibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends. as an institution subject to category iv standards, we are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing in even-numbered years; however, the frb required us to participate in the 2023 ccar supervisory stress test to incorporate the effects of the investors acquisition. our scb associated with the 2023 supervisory stress test was 4.0%, effective october 1, 2023 through september 30, 2024.
regulations relating to capital planning, regulatory reporting, stress testing and capital buffer requirements applicable to firms like us are presently subject to rule-making and potential further guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. we will continue to evaluate the impact of these and any other prudential regulatory changes, including their potential resultant changes in our regulatory and compliance costs and expenses.
regulatory capital ratios and capital composition under the current u.s. basel iii capital framework, we and our banking subsidiary, cbna, must meet the following specific minimum requirements: cet1 capital ratio of 4.5%, tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, total capital ratio of 8.0% and tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. as a bhc, our scb of 4.0% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above and a ccb of 2.5% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above for cbna.

at december 31, 2023, cfg's cet1 and tier 1 capital ratios increased compared to december 31, 2022, primarily driven by net income and a $12.6 billion decrease in rwa, partially offset by dividends, common share repurchases, and a decrease in the modified cecl transition amount as we entered the second year of the cecl three-year transition period. lower commercial and auto loans were the key drivers for the decline in rwa.
at december 31, 2023, cbna's cet1 and tier 1 capital ratios increased slightly compared to december 31, 2022. net income and a $12.7 billion decrease in rwa, primarily driven by lower commercial and auto loans, was partially offset by dividend payments to the parent company and a decrease in the modified cecl transition amount as we entered the second year of the cecl three-year transition period.
at december 31, 2023, cfg's and cbna's total capital ratios increased driven by their respective changes in cet1 and tier 1 capital described above and a reduction in the modified aacl transition amount.
at december 31, 2023, cfg's tier 1 leverage ratio was stable compared to december 31, 2022, whereas cbna's tier 1 leverage ratio decreased. cbna's tier 1 leverage ratio reflects a decline in quarterly adjusted average assets and changes in tier 1 capital described above.

capital transactions we completed the following capital transactions during 2023:
•repurchased $906 million of our outstanding common stock;
•declared quarterly common stock dividends of $0.42 per share, aggregating to $808 million; and
•declared preferred stock dividends aggregating to $117 million.
for additional detail regarding our common and preferred stock dividends see note 17.
in february 2023, our board of directors increased our common share repurchase authorization to $2.0 billion, which was an increase of $1.15 billion above the $850 million of capacity remaining as of december 31, 2022 under the prior june 2022 authorization. see "issuer purchase of equity securities" in item 5 above for information regarding our available capacity to repurchase shares at december 31, 2023. all future capital distributions are subject to consideration and approval by our board of directors prior to execution. the timing and amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, and regulatory considerations.

recent regulatory developments bank failures on april 28, 2023, the frb issued a report relative to its review of the supervision and regulation of silicon valley bank ("svb"). the report details the frb's assessment of the primary causes for svb's failure and emphasizes the frb's view that supervision and regulation need to be strengthened based on its findings. as a result, the frb stated it intends to evaluate its supervisory and regulatory framework, with a focus on the following areas:
•regulatory tailoring framework, including a reassessment of a range of rules for banks with $100 billion or more in assets;
•management of interest rate risk;
•liquidity risk, commencing with the risks of uninsured deposits; and
•capital requirements.
proposals addressing the regulatory tailoring framework and capital requirements were issued by the regulatory agencies during the third quarter of 2023. see the "regulation and supervision" section in item 1 for more information.
we will continue to monitor and address changes to the frb's supervisory and regulatory framework that may result from this targeted review by the frb and their associated impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
aoci impact on regulatory capital under the current applicable regulatory capital rules we have made the aoci opt-out election, which enables us to exclude components of aoci from regulatory capital. as noted in the "capital and stress testing requirements" section of "regulation and supervision" in item 1, the regulatory agencies are considering the inclusion of aoci components in regulatory capital for category iv firms like us, notably the aoci relative to securities and pension.
the following table presents our regulatory capital ratios including the aoci impact from securities and pension, which we believe provides useful information in light of recent events and the potential for change in the regulatory capital framework.

liquidity we consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity fundamental to our safety and soundness. we define liquidity as our ability to meet our obligations when they come due. as a financial institution, we must maintain operating liquidity to meet expected daily and forecasted cash-flow requirements, as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected (stress scenario) funding requirements. reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stress-scenario funding requirements, we identify and manage contingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the frb, unencumbered high-quality liquid securities and unused fhlb borrowing capacity. separately, we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the frb and unencumbered high-quality liquid securities. we maintain additional secured borrowing capacity at the frb discount window, but do not view this as a primary means of funding, but rather a potential source in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. we manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity.
parent company liquidity our parent company's primary sources of cash are dividends and interest received from cbna resulting from investing in bank equity and subordinated debt as well as externally issued preferred stock, senior debt and subordinated debt. uses of cash include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company, including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends, interest and expenses; the needs of subsidiaries, including cbna for additional equity and, as required, its need for debt financing; and the support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. to the extent the parent company has relied on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest.
our parent company's cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled $2.9 billion and $1.6 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, the parent company declared dividends on common stock of $808 million and $779 million, respectively, and declared dividends on preferred stock of $117 million and $113 million, respectively.
during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, the parent company repurchased $906 million and $153 million, respectively, of its outstanding common stock.
on january 23, 2024, cfg issued $1.25 billion in six-year 5.841% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes.
cbna liquidity as cbna's primary business involves taking deposits and making loans, a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds. liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings, pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. in the ordinary course of business the liquidity of cbna is managed by matching sources and uses of cash. the primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers; payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities; and wholesale borrowings, as needed, and as described under "liquidity risk management and governance." the primary uses of bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits; payment of interest on deposits; funding of loans and related commitments; and funding of securities purchases. to the extent that cbna has relied on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest. for further information on cbna's outstanding debt see note 13.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, cbna completed the following transactions:
•issued $450 million of 5.284% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes;
•redeemed $750 million of senior notes due march 2023; and
•issued $3.5 billion of secured borrowings collateralized by auto loans.
on january 23, 2024, cbna issued approximately $1.5 billion of secured borrowings collateralized by auto loans.

liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk arising from the inability to meet our obligations when they come due. we must maintain adequate funding to meet current and future obligations, including customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, equipment and premises leases, and other cash commitments, under both normal operating conditions and under periods of company-specific and/or market stress.
we primarily rely on customer deposits to be a relatively stable and low-cost source of funding. in addition to customer deposits, our funding sources also include our ability to securitize loans in secondary markets, raise funds in the debt and equity capital markets, pledge loans and/or securities for borrowing from the fhlb, pledge securities as collateral for borrowing under repurchase agreements, and sell afs securities.
credit ratings assigned by agencies such as moody's, standard and poor's, and fitch impact our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large uninsured customer deposits and are presented in the table below.

nr = not rated we currently have a "stable" outlook at standard & poor's, a "negative" outlook at moody's and a "stable" outlook at fitch. changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding.
existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices. the frb and occ regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process. in addition, we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements, some of which are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. for further discussion, see the "liquidity requirements" section under "regulation and supervision" in item 1.
liquidity risk management and governance liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury group in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset liability committee. the funding and liquidity unit is responsible for maintaining a liquidity management framework that effectively manages liquidity risk. processes within this framework include, but are not limited to, regular and comprehensive reporting, including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators, explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and, as appropriate, recommended remedial strategies, liquidity stress testing, contingency funding plans, and collateral management.
our funding and liquidity unit's primary goals are to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements, contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic, systemic, and combination stress events, and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and cost-efficient funding sources. we seek to accomplish these goals by funding loans with stable deposits, by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding, particularly short-term unsecured funding, and by maintaining ample available liquidity, including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered high-quality loans and securities.
citizens financial group, inc. | 59
we maintain a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. the plan identifies members of the liquidity contingency team and provides a framework for management to follow, including notification and escalation of potential liquidity stress events.
in response to the recent u.s. bank failures, the frb established the bank term funding program to make additional funding available to eligible depository institutions to ensure the ability to meet the needs of all depositors. this program was designed to provide another source of liquidity against the par value of high-quality securities, eliminating the need to sell these securities during times of stress. the company is eligible to borrow under this program, which expires in march 2024, based on its existing eligibility for primary credit under the frb discount window. the company has taken steps to support readiness but has not participated in the program through december 31, 2023.
as of december 31, 2023:
•organically generated deposits continue to be our primary source of funding, resulting in a consolidated period-end loans-to-deposits ratio, excluding lhfs, of 82.3%;
◦estimated insured/secured deposits comprise 71% of our consolidated deposit base of $177.3 billion.
•our total available liquidity, comprised of contingent liquidity and available discount window capacity, was approximately $78.8 billion;
◦contingent liquidity was $57.1 billion, consisting of unencumbered high-quality liquid securities of $31.4 billion, unused fhlb capacity of $15.9 billion, and our cash balances at the frb of $9.8 billion; and
◦available discount window capacity was $21.7 billion, defined as available total borrowing capacity from the frb based on identified collateral, which is primarily secured by non-mortgage commercial and retail loans.
for a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, see the consolidated statements of cash flows in item 8.
the funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics, including specific risk thresholds limits. these monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows:
•current liquidity sources and capacities, including cash balances at the frb, free and liquid securities, and secured borrowing capacity at the fhlb and frb discount window;
•liquidity stress sources, including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined stresses, in addition to evolving regulatory requirements; and
•current and prospective exposures, including secured and unsecured wholesale funding, and spot and cumulative cash-flow gaps across a variety of horizons.
further, certain of these metrics are monitored individually for cbna and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis, including cash position, unencumbered securities, asset liquidity and available fhlb borrowing capacity. in order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions, specific metrics are also forecasted over a one-year horizon.
contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash payments, including customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, lease obligations and other cash commitments. for more information regarding these obligations, see notes 9, 12 and 13.
off-balance sheet arrangements we engage in a variety of activities that are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are generally referred to as "off-balance sheet arrangements." for more information on these types of activities, see note 19.

critical accounting estimates our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements.
an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements. estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time. changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below. see note 1 for further discussion of our significant accounting policies.
allowance for credit losses the acl increased from $2.2 billion at december 31, 2022 to $2.3 billion at december 31, 2023.
our acl as of december 31, 2023 accounts for an economic forecast over our two-year reasonable and supportable period with peak unemployment of approximately 5% and peak-to-trough gdp decline of approximately 0.4%. this forecast reflects a mild recession over the two-year reasonable and supportable period. this compares to our december 31, 2022 forecast which reflected peak unemployment of approximately 6% with a more adverse peak-to-trough gdp decline of approximately 1.4%.
our determination of the acl is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable forecast period. to illustrate the sensitivity, we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which reflects deeper real gdp contraction across our two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, resulting in a 1.7% peak-to-trough decline in real gdp. excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately 1.10x our modeled period-end acl, or an increase of approximately $233 million. this analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall period-end acl, which includes qualitative adjustments.
because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the acl, this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the acl or even what the acl would be under these economic circumstances. the sensitivity is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates. the hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the acl and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates.
it remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our acl because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs, and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction, and such changes may have differing impacts by product type. the variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by risks to the economy, including changing monetary and fiscal policies, impacts from the recent stress on the banking industry, and their impact on inflationary trends. changes in one or multiple of the key macroeconomic variables may have a material impact to our estimation of expected credit losses.
for additional information regarding the acl, see note 6.
goodwill the acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at their fair values. business combinations typically result in goodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the goodwill has been attributed. we review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of october 31st or more frequently if events or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. when assessing goodwill for impairment, a qualitative assessment may be made to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. alternatively, a quantitative assessment may be performed without performing a qualitative assessment. at december 31, 2023, goodwill totaled $8.2 billion, including $6.9 billion from pre-ipo acquisitions, and is assigned to our reporting units as follows: $5.5 billion to commercial banking, including $4.7 billion from pre-ipo acquisitions, and $2.7 billion to consumer banking, including $2.2 billion from pre-ipo acquisitions.
citizens financial group, inc. | 61
the process of evaluating the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective, involving management assumptions and estimates and the use of external or internal valuations. valuation techniques include discounted cash flow and market approach analysis. in the fourth quarter of 2023, the quantitative impairment test estimated the fair value of the reporting units using an equal weighting of an income approach (i.e., discounted cash flows method) and market-based approach (i.e., the guideline public company method). the guideline public company method utilizes comparable public company information and key valuation multiples, and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit, and guideline transactions, when applicable.
under the income approach, cash flow projections are based on multi-year financial forecasts developed for each reporting unit that consider key business drivers such as new business initiatives, customer retention standards, market share changes, anticipated loan and deposit growth, fees and expenses, forward interest rates, historical performance, credit performance, and industry and economic trends, among other considerations. the projection of net interest income and noninterest expense are the most significant inputs to the financial projections of the commercial banking and consumer banking reporting units. the long-term earnings growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was 3% as of october 31, 2023, based on management's assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit. discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and unsystematic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. the discount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. a discount rate of 13% was utilized for the commercial banking and consumer banking reporting units as of october 31, 2023.
we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2023 as part of our annual impairment assessment. based on this quantitative assessment, we concluded that the estimated fair value of the consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units exceeded their carrying value. the commercial banking reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%. circumstances that could negatively impact the future fair value of the commercial banking reporting unit include a sustained decrease in our stock price, decline in industry peer multiples, deterioration in the reporting unit's forecasts, and an increase in the discount rate driven by an increase in the risk-free rate or the risk we may not achieve our forecasted cash flows.
we monitored events and circumstances during the period from october 31, 2023 through december 31, 2023, including macroeconomic and market factors, industry and banking sector events, company-specific performance indicators, a comparison of management's forecast and assumptions to those used in its october 31, 2023 quantitative impairment test, and the sensitivity of the october 31, 2023 quantitative test results to changes in assumptions through december 31, 2023. based on these considerations, management concluded that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of either of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of december 31, 2023.
for additional information regarding goodwill, see note 10.
fair value we asses the fair value of assets and liabilities by applying various valuation methodologies which may involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when active markets do not exist for the items being valued. quoted market prices are used to estimate the fair value of certain assets such as trading assets, investment securities and residential real estate loans held for sale. assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of items for which an observable active market does not exist and include discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different fair value estimates, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or fair value disclosures.
we also assess whether there are any declines in fair value below the carrying value of assets that require recognition of a loss in the consolidated statements of operations, including certain investments, capitalized servicing assets, goodwill, and core deposit and other intangible assets.
for additional information regarding our fair value measurements, see note 20.

risk governance we are committed to maintaining a strong, integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives. a key aspect of our board's responsibility as the main decision-making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood.
to enable our board to carry out its objectives, it has delegated authority for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, to a number of board and executive management level risk committees. the executive risk committee, chaired by the chief risk officer, is responsible for oversight of risk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks, analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified, assessed and mitigated. reporting to the executive risk committee are the following committees covering specific areas of risk: compliance and operational risk, model risk, credit policy, asset liability, business initiatives review, and conduct and ethics.
risk framework our risk management framework is embedded in our business through a "three lines of defense" model which defines responsibilities and accountabilities for risk management activities.
first line of defense the business lines, including their associated support functions, are the first line of defense and are accountable for identifying, assessing, managing, and controlling the risks associated with the products and services they provide. the business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility, complying with relevant risk policies, testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their operational and financial reporting controls on a regular basis, establishing and documenting operating procedures, and establishing a governance structure for identifying and managing risk.
second line of defense the second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for the development of risk and control frameworks and related policies, and their associated implementation. this centralized risk function is independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, operational, regulatory, reputational, interest rate, liquidity, legal and strategic risks.
third line of defense our internal audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance of the effectiveness of our internal controls, governance practices, and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for the size, complexity, and risk profile of the organization. internal audit has complete and unrestricted access to all of our records, physical properties and personnel. internal audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to the board's audit committee on a quarterly basis.
credit review reports to the chief audit executive and provides the board, senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed credit risk appetite and credit policies and processes. in line with its procedures and regulatory expectations, the credit review function undertakes a program of portfolio testing, assessing and reporting through four risk pillars of asset quality, rating and data integrity, risk management and credit risk appetite.
risk appetite risk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool. we define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we could be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations.
citizens financial group, inc. | 64
our principal non-market risks include credit, operational, regulatory, reputational, liquidity and strategic risks. we are also subject to certain market risks which include potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. market risk in our business arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including hedging of interest rates, foreign exchange risk and non-trading activities within capital markets. we have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report on market risk. we actively manage both trading and non-trading market risks. see "market risk" for further information. our risk appetite is reviewed and approved annually by the board risk committee.
credit risk overview credit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation. while the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, and trading activities. given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet, the assessment, approval and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall risk-management responsibility.
objective the independent credit risk function is responsible for reviewing and approving credit risk appetite across all lines of business and credit products, approving larger and higher-risk credit transactions, monitoring portfolio performance, identifying problem credit exposures, and ensuring remedial management.
organizational structure management and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the business line and the second line of defense. the second line of defense, the independent credit risk function, is led by the chief credit officer who oversees all credit risk and reports to the chief risk officer. the chief credit officer, acting in a manner consistent with board policies, has responsibility for, among other things, the governance process around policies, procedures, risk acceptance criteria, credit risk appetite, limits and authority delegation. the chief credit officer and team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger and higher-risk transactions and oversight of line of business credit risk activities. reporting to the chief credit officer are the heads of the second line of defense credit functions specializing in: consumer banking, commercial banking, citizens restructuring management, portfolio and corporate reporting, alll analytics, current expected credit loss, and credit policy and administration. each team under these leaders is composed of experienced credit professionals.
governance the primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies. these policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite. material changes in our business model and strategies that identify a need to change our risk appetite or highlight a risk not previously contemplated are identified by the individual committees and presented to the credit policy committee, executive risk committee and the board risk committee for approval, as appropriate.
key management processes we employ a comprehensive and integrated risk control program to proactively identify, measure, monitor, and mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit life cycle including origination, account/portfolio management, and loss mitigation and recovery.
consumer on the consumer banking side of credit risk, our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the life cycle of the loan. credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant at origination. when approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line, credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability, length of term, collateral value, collateral type, and lien subordination.
citizens financial group, inc. | 65
lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams. the amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual. we periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority. only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies. it is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies when compensating factors are present. there are exception limits which, when reached, trigger a comprehensive analysis.
credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals once an account is established to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk. our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and, where appropriate, is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency.
commercial on the commercial banking side of credit risk, risk management begins with defined credit products and policies and is separated into commercial and industrial loans, cre and leases. within commercial and industrial loans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products (e.g., asset-based lending, leasing, franchise finance, health care, technology and mid-corporate). a "specialty vertical" is a stand-alone team of industry or product specialists. substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists. cre also operates as a specialty vertical.
commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and, with few exceptions, are subject to a formal annual review requirement. the underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that establish the pd and lgd. all material transactions require the approval of both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority. the approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the pd. the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted, facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur, and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution. all authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent credit risk function and is closely monitored and updated annually at a minimum.
the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower, assessment of the borrower's management capabilities, cash flows from operations, industry sector trends, type and sufficiency of collateral, type of exposure, transaction structure, and the general economic outlook. while these are the primary factors considered, there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process. in addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review, our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations. this group conducts portfolio reviews on a risk-based cycle to evaluate individual loans and validate risk ratings, as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management.
the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers. concentration risk is managed through limits on industry asset class and loan quality factors. we focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets, although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives.
substantially all loans categorized as classified are managed by a specialized group of credit professionals.
market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including the hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. as described below, the market risk arising from our non-trading banking activities, such as the origination of loans and deposit-gathering, is more significant. we have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. we actively manage market risk for both non-trading and trading activities.
citizens financial group, inc. | 66
non-trading risk our non-trading banking activities expose us to market risk. this market risk is composed of interest rate risk, as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk. we also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations, as well as the valuation of our msrs.
interest rate risk interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets, liabilities and equity. we refer to this non-trading risk embedded in the balance sheet as "structural interest rate risk" or "interest rate risk in the banking book."
a major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets relative to liabilities and equity. there are differences in the timing and drivers of rate changes reflecting the maturity and/or repricing of assets and liabilities. for example, the rate earned on a commercial loan may reprice monthly with changes in the benchmark rate, while the rate paid on debt or certificates of deposit may be fixed for a longer period. there may also be differences in the drivers of rate changes. loans may be tied to a specific index rate such as sofr or prime, while deposits may not be as correlated with such rates and more dependent upon competitive demand. due to these basis differences, net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates.
a primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floating-rate loans relative to core deposit funding. this source of asset sensitivity is more biased toward the short end of the yield curve.
the secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixed-rate loans, as well as prepayment risk on mortgage-related loans and securities funded by non-rate sensitive deposits and equity.
another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. for example, most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can be withdrawn without penalty. the exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above.
the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by our board. these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. to ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within our risk appetite, we measure the exposure and hedge it, as necessary. the treasury asset and liability management team is responsible for measuring, monitoring and reporting on our structural interest rate risk position. these exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the asset liability committee and at board meetings.
we measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both short-term and long-term exposures. the primary method we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets, liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a three-year horizon. exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across these scenarios.
key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, changes in product balances and the behavior of our loan and deposit customers in different rate environments. repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate (i.e., non-contractual) maturities, as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments are the most significant behavioral assumptions. we utilize product level models that consider specific product characteristics and composition of the deposit portfolio, along with current and forward-looking market dynamics, to project deposit rates. similarly, we employ dynamic prepayment and mortgage rate models to project prepayment behaviors specific to each of our product offerings. these models are developed based on internal performance data over prior interest rate cycles and calibrated to our experience and outlook for rates across a diverse set of market environments. we assess our models and assumptions periodically by running sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of changes to inputs or assumptions on our risk results, which are reported to the asset liability committee.
citizens financial group, inc. | 67
since we cannot predict the future path of interest rates, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a "most likely" (implied forward) scenario, as well as a variety of extreme and unlikely scenarios. these scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates, immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short- or long-term rates predominate. generally, projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market-forward rates are realized.
the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios. our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve. as the following table illustrates, our balance sheet is marginally asset-sensitive; net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates, while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limits established and monitored by senior management. while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis, we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would be more gradual and, therefore, have a more modest impact.
the table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve:

we continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy, changing market conditions and changes in our balance sheet. the company's base case net interest income assumes the forward-rate path implied by the yield curve is realized, which reflects a fed funds rate of 4.25% at the end of 2024, reflecting five 25 basis point reductions beginning in the second quarter of 2024. the rate risk exposure is then measured based on assumed changes from that base case rate path.
as of december 31, 2023, our asset sensitivity has shifted to a more neutral position compared to 2022. this reflects the impacts of changes in our balance sheet mix, including securities, loans, deposits, borrowed funds and ongoing hedge activity, which is primarily comprised of received fixed swaps that offset our naturally asset-sensitive balance sheet. our sensitivity profile exhibits asymmetry for up and down rate scenarios as we expect to see incremental deposit migration to higher rate products in response to rising rate scenarios compared to declining rate scenario.
we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk, eve, as a supplement to net interest income simulations. eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a long-term horizon. eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. we employ sophisticated models for prepayments and deposit pricing and attrition, which provide a granular view of cash flows based on the unique characteristics of the underlying products and customer segments. the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital.

we use interest rate contracts as part of our alm strategy to manage exposure to the variability in the interest cash flows on our floating-rate assets and wholesale funding, the variability in the fair value of afs securities, and to hedge market risk on fixed-rate capital markets debt issuances.

(1) weighted average floor and cap rates represent strike rates through which cfg will receive interest if the sofr rate falls below the floor strike rate and pay interest if the sofr rate exceeds the cap strike rate.
(2) weighted average floor rate represents strike rates for the short and long interest rate floors, respectively. cfg will receive interest if the sofr rate falls below the upper strike rate and pay interest if the sofr rate falls below the lower strike rate, effectively hedging the corridor between the two strike rates. the structure also includes a short cap and a long floor which are utilized to neutralize the initial premium.

using the interest rate curve at december 31, 2023, we estimate that approximately $914 million in pre-tax net losses related to cash flow hedge strategies will be reclassified from aoci to net interest income over the next 12 months, including $460 million from terminated swaps. this amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations and the addition of other hedges subsequent to december 31, 2023.
libor transition in july 2017, the united kingdom's fca announced that it would no longer require banks to submit libor rates after 2021. on march 5, 2021, the fca formally announced the future cessation of 1-week and 2-month u.s. dollar libor rates as of december 31, 2021, with all other u.s. dollar libor tenors ceasing as of june 30, 2023. in the united states, the alternative reference rates committee, a group of private-market participants convened to help ensure a successful transition away from u.s. dollar libor, identified sofr as its recommended alternative rate.
on march 15, 2022, the adjustable interest rate (libor) act (the "libor act") was signed into law, with the frb adopting its final rule, effective february 27, 2023, to implement the libor act on december 16, 2022. the final rule addresses references to libor in contracts that (i) are governed by u.s. law; (ii) will not mature before june 30, 2023; and (iii) lack fallback provisions providing for a clearly defined and practical replacement for libor. the company assessed the impact of this legislation and applied its provisions accordingly to transition its libor contracts to an alternative rate.
as of june 30, 2023, the company's transition and remediation efforts were complete, with ongoing monitoring for libor-based financial instruments that will transition to alternative rates at their next interest rate reset date.

capital markets a key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to finance merger and acquisition transactions for our clients. we have a rigorous risk management process around these activities, including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk, potential loss, and sub-limits for specific asset classes. further, the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in the loan underwriting approval committee.
mortgage servicing rights we have market risk associated with the value of residential msrs, which are impacted by various types of inherent risks, including duration, basis, convexity, volatility and yield curve.
as part of our overall risk management strategy we enter into various free-standing derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate futures and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-backed securities to economically hedge the change in fair value of our msrs. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of our msrs was $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, and the total notional amount of related derivative contracts was $15.1 billion and $12.9 billion, respectively. gains and losses on msrs and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in mortgage banking fees in the consolidated statements of operations.
as with our traded market risk-based activities, earnings at risk excludes the impact of msrs. msrs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk consistent with the definition used by banking regulators.
trading risk we are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products as well as underwriting and market making activities. exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities, equity securities, corporate bonds and secondary loan instruments. these securities underwriting and trading activities are conducted through cbna and citizens jmp securities, llc.
client facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives, financially settled commodity derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure. in addition, we operate trading desks covering secondary loans, corporate bonds, and equity securities, with the objective of meeting secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients' transactions and investor clients. we do not engage in any trading activities to benefit from short-term price differences.
market risk governance the process of setting our market risk limit is established in accordance with the formal enterprise risk appetite process and policy, which reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for creating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to assume. dealing authorities represent the key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout the enterprise. a dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business and/or trading desk is permitted to operate, which is reviewed annually at a minimum. dealing authorities are structured to accommodate client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile, with responsibility for remaining within established tolerances residing with the business. key risk indicators, including var, open foreign currency positions and single name risk are monitored daily and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to the appropriate business line management and risk counterparts.
market risk measurement we use var as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions. our var framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same. risk management var is based on a one-day holding period to a 99% confidence level and regulatory var is based on a ten-day holding period to the same confidence level. in addition to var, non-statistical measurements for measuring risk such as sensitivity analysis, market value and stress testing are employed.

our market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models capture correlation effects across all our "covered positions" and allow for aggregation of market risk across products, risk types, business lines and legal entities. we measure, monitor and report market risk for management and regulatory capital purposes.
var overview the market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation. the var measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements (general var) such as changes in the level of interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. it is calculated on the basis that current positions remain relatively unaltered over the course of a given holding period with the assumption that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions, if required, within this holding period. based on the composition of our "covered positions," we also use a standardized add-on approach for the loan trading and high yield bond desks' specific risk capital, which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements. the general var approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days. the internal var measure, used as the basis of the main var trading limits, is a 99% confidence level with a one-day holding period, indicating that a loss greater than the var is expected to occur, on average, on only one day in 100 trading days (i.e., 1% of the time). theoretically, there should be a loss event greater than var two to three times per year. the regulatory measure of var is a 99% confidence level with a ten-day holding period. the historical market data applied to calculate the var is updated on a two-business day lag. refer to "market risk regulatory capital" below for details of our ten-day var metrics for the quarters ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.
market risk regulatory capital the u.s. banking regulators' "market risk rule" covers the calculation of market risk capital. under this rule all of our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and qualify as "covered positions." the internal management var measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory var.

stressed var svar is an extension of var and utilizes a longer historical look-back horizon, fixed from january 3, 2005, to identify headline risks from more volatile periods and to provide a counterbalance to var, which may be low during periods of low volatility. the holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days. in addition to its utilization for risk management purposes, svar is a component of market risk regulatory capital. we calculate svar daily under its own dynamic window regime whereby values of the ten-day, 99% var are calculated over all 260-day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set. refer to "market risk regulatory capital" above for svar metrics.
sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread. we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, basis spreads, foreign exchange exposures, option prices and credit spreads. since var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods, it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves. sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations.
stress testing conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios. for historical stress tests, profit and loss results are simulated for select time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns, while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk, illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our trading activities that may not be fully captured by our other risk-measurement methodologies. hypothetical scenarios also assume that market moves occur simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as market events unfold. stress tests of our trading positions are generated daily.
var model review and validation our market risk measurement models are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owners. this independent review and validation focuses on model methodology, market data and performance and is the responsibility of citizens' model risk management and validation team. this team challenges the assumptions used and quantitative techniques employed, including the theoretical justification supporting them, and performs an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time. the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions is estimated (e.g., through developing alternative models), if possible. the market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior. the market risk management and validation team conducts internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to market data mapping.
var backtesting backtesting is one form of validation of the var model and is run daily. the market risk rule requires a comparison of our internal var measure to the actual net trading revenue (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, intra-day trading and net interest income) for each day over the preceding year (the most recent 250 business days). any observed loss in excess of the var number is taken as an exception. the level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the var and svar-based capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes, when applicable. we perform sub-portfolio backtesting as required under the market risk rule, using models approved by our banking regulators for interest rate, credit spread and foreign exchange positions.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction in management's discussion and analysis ("md&a"), we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for steris and its subsidiaries including:
•what factors affect our business;
•what our earnings and costs were;
•why those earnings and costs were different from the year before;
•where our earnings came from;
•how this affects our overall financial condition;
•what our expenditures for capital projects were; and
•where cash is expected to come from to fund future debt principal repayments, growth outside of core operations, repurchase ordinary shares, pay cash dividends and fund future working capital needs.
the md&a also analyzes and explains the annual changes in the specific line items in the consolidated statements of income. as you read the md&a, it may be helpful to refer to information in item 1, "business," part i, item 1a, "risk factors," and note 12 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies" for a discussion of some of the matters that can adversely affect our business and results of operations. this information, discussion, and disclosure may be important to you in making decisions about your investments in steris.
financial measures in the following sections of the md&a, we may, at times, refer to financial measures that are not required to be presented in the consolidated financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("u.s. gaap"). we sometimes use the following financial measures in the context of this report: backlog; debt-to-total capital; and days sales outstanding. we define these financial measures as follows:
•backlog - we define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. we use this figure as a measure to assist in the projection of short-term financial results and inventory requirements.
•debt-to-total capital - we define debt-to-total capital as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and shareholders' equity. we use this figure as a financial liquidity measure to gauge our ability to borrow and fund growth.
•days sales outstanding ("dso") - we define dso as the average collection period for accounts receivable. it is calculated as net accounts receivable divided by the trailing four quarters' revenues, multiplied by 365 days. we use this figure to help gauge the quality of accounts receivable and expected time to collect.
we, at times, may also refer to financial measures which are considered to be "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. we have presented these financial measures because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of certain additional factors underlying that performance. these financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. our calculations of these measures may differ from calculations of similar measures used by other companies, and you should be careful when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. additional information regarding these financial measures, including reconciliations of each non-gaap financial measure, is available in the subsection of md&a titled, "non-gaap financial measures."
revenues- defined as required by regulation s-x, we separately present revenues generated as either product revenues or service revenues on our consolidated statements of income for each period presented. when we discuss revenues, we may, at times, refer to revenues summarized differently than the regulation s-x requirements. the terminology, definitions, and applications of terms that we use to describe revenues may be different from terms used by other companies. we use the following terms to describe revenues:
•revenues - our revenues are presented net of sales returns and allowances.
•product revenues - we define product revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable and capital equipment products.
•service revenues - we define service revenues as revenues generated from parts and labor associated with the maintenance, repair, and installation of our capital equipment. service revenues also include outsourced reprocessing services and instrument and scope repairs, as well as revenues generated from contract sterilization and laboratory services offered through our ast segment.
•capital equipment revenues - we define capital equipment revenues as revenues generated from sales of capital equipment, which includes steam and gas sterilizers, low temperature liquid chemical sterilant processing systems, pure steam/water systems, surgical lights and tables, and integrated or.
•consumable revenues - we define consumable revenues as revenues generated from sales of the consumable family of products, which includes dedicated consumables used in our v-pro sterilizers and automated endoscope reprocessors, system 1 and 1e consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, instruments and tools, sterility assurance products, barrier protection solutions, and cleaning consumables.
•recurring revenues - we define recurring revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable products and service revenues.
general overview and executive summary steris is a leading global provider of products and services that support patient care with an emphasis on infection prevention. we help our customers create a healthier and safer world by providing innovative healthcare and life science products and services around the globe. we offer our customers a unique mix of innovative products and services. these include: consumable products, such as detergents, endoscopy accessories, barrier products, instruments and tools; and services, including equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, instrument and scope repair, laboratory testing, outsourced reprocessing; and capital equipment, such as sterilizers, surgical tables, and automated endoscope reprocessors, and connectivity solutions such as operating room ("or") integration.
we operate and report our financial information in three reportable business segments: healthcare, applied sterilization technologies ("ast"), and life sciences. previously, we had four reportable business segments; however, as a result of the agreement to divest our dental segment, dental is presented as discontinued operations. historical information has been retrospectively adjusted to exclude discontinued operations for comparability, as required. for more information, refer to note 4 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "discontinued operations." non-allocated operating costs that support the entire company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income. we describe our business segments in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "business segment information."
the bulk of our revenues are derived from healthcare, medical device and pharmaceutical customers. much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions.
in addition, there is increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our customers to operate more efficiently, all which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services.
acquisitions. on august 2, 2023, we purchased the surgical instrumentation, laparoscopic instrumentation and sterilization container assets from becton, dickinson and company ("bd") (nyse: bdx). the acquired assets from bd are being integrated into our healthcare segment.
the purchase price of the acquisition was $539.8 million. the acquisition also qualified for a tax benefit related to tax deductible goodwill, with a present value of approximately $60.0 million. the purchase price of the acquisition was financed with borrowings from our existing credit facility. for more information, refer to note 8 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "debt."
in addition to the acquisition of bd, we completed two other tuck-in acquisitions during fiscal 2024, which expanded our product and service offerings in the ast and healthcare segments. total aggregate consideration was approximately $6.5 million, net of cash acquired.
during fiscal 2023, we completed several tuck-in acquisitions which expanded our product and service offerings in the ast and healthcare segments. total aggregate consideration was approximately $49.8 million, including potential contingent consideration of $7.3 million.
divestitures and discontinued operations. on april 11, 2024, the company announced its plan to sell its dental segment for total cash consideration of $787.5 million, subject to customary adjustments, and up to an additional $12.5 million in contingent payment should the dental business achieve certain revenue targets in fiscal 2025. the transaction is structured as an equity sale. a component of an entity is reported in discontinued operations after meeting the criteria for held for sale classification if the disposition represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the entity's operations and financial results. we analyzed the quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the divestiture of our dental segment and determined that those conditions for discontinued operations presentation had been met prior to march 31, 2024. the dental segment results of operations have been reclassified to income (loss) from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and we have classified our dental segment's assets and liabilities as held for sale for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. previously, the dental business was a separate reportable segment. for additional information regarding this transaction and its effect on our financial reporting, refer to note 4 titled "discontinued operations" and note 13 titled "business segment information." proceeds received from the sale will be used to pay off existing debt.
on april 1, 2024, we completed the sale of the controlled environment certification services business. in fiscal 2025, we recorded net proceeds of $41.5 million. the business generated approximately $35.0 million in revenue during fiscal 2024.
for more information regarding our recent acquisitions and divestitures, see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "business acquisitions and divestitures."
highlights.  revenues increased $602.4 million, or 13.3%, to $5,138.7 million for the year ended march 31, 2024, as compared to $4,536.3 million for the year ended march 31, 2023. these increases reflect higher volume, including the added volume from the acquisition of assets from bd in the healthcare segment, and pricing.
our gross profit percentage decreased to 43.2% for fiscal 2024 as compared to 43.7% for fiscal 2023. unfavorable impacts from productivity, inflationary cost increases for materials and labor, and restructuring charges were partially offset by favorable impacts from pricing.
fiscal 2024 income from operations increased 5.7% to $836.1 million over fiscal 2023 income from operations of $791.1 million. this increase was primarily due to the benefit of higher volume and pricing during fiscal 2024 which was partially offset by restructuring charges incurred during fiscal 2024.
cash flows provided by operating activities were $973.3 million and free cash flow was $620.3 million in fiscal 2024 compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $756.9 million and free cash flow of $409.6 million in fiscal 2023 (see subsection of md&a titled, "non-gaap financial measures" for additional information and related reconciliation of cash flows from operations to free cash flow). cash flows from operations resulted from the increase in operating activity and lower use of cash for working capital requirements. the increase in free cash flow was driven by cash flows from operations as capital spending in fiscal 2024 was comparable to fiscal 2023.
our debt-to-total capital ratio was 33.7% at march 31, 2024. during the year, we increased our quarterly dividend for the eighteenth consecutive year to $0.52.
outlook. in fiscal 2025 and beyond, we expect to manage our costs, grow our business with internal product and service development, invest in greater capacity, and augment these value creating methods with potential acquisitions of additional products and services. we anticipate continued inflation pressure in fiscal 2025, but not at the significant level experienced in fiscal 2024 and 2023. please refer to "information with respect to our business in general" in item 1."business" to this annual report on form 10-k.
non-gaap financial measures we, at times, refer to financial measures which are considered to be "non-gaap financial measures" under the securities and exchange commission rules. we, at times, also refer to our results of operations excluding certain transactions or amounts that are non-recurring or are not indicative of future results, in order to provide meaningful comparisons between the periods presented.
these non-gaap financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from or as an alternative to the most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measures.
these non-gaap financial measures are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the board of directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. these amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented.
we believe that the presentation of these non-gaap financial measures, when considered along with our u.s. gaap financial measures and the reconciliation to the corresponding u.s. gaap financial measures, provides the reader with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. it is important for the reader to note that the non-gaap financial measures used may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows less purchases of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles (capital expenditures) plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles, which are also presented within investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. we use this as a measure to gauge our ability to pay cash dividends, fund growth outside of core operations, fund future debt principal repayments, and repurchase shares.
the following table summarizes the calculation of our free cash flow for the years ended march 31, 2024 and 2023:

results of operations in the following subsections, we discuss our performance and the factors affecting it. we begin with a general overview of our operating results and then separately discuss earnings for our operating segments. as a result of the agreement to divest our dental segment, dental is presented as discontinued operations. historical information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect these changes for comparability, as required. therefore, the discussion within this results of operations section excludes discontinued operations and relates solely to our continuing operations.
the discussion of and factors affecting our performance for the year ended march 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended march 31, 2022 is included in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended march 31, 2023.

nm - not meaningful selling, general, and administrative expenses. significant components of total selling, general, and administrative expenses ("sg&a") are compensation and benefit costs, fees for professional services, travel and entertainment expenses, facility costs, gains or losses from divestitures, and other general and administrative expenses. sg&a increased 14.8% in fiscal 2024 over fiscal 2023. the fiscal 2024 increase is primarily attributable to increased compensation, including incentive compensation and benefit costs, as well as increase in dealer incentives and professional fees.
research and development. research and development expenses increased $5.2 million in fiscal 2024 over fiscal 2023. research and development expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations. during fiscal 2024, our investments in research and development have continued to be focused on, but were not limited to, enhancing capabilities of sterile processing combination technologies, procedural products and accessories, and devices and support accessories used in gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures.
restructuring expenses. we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan (the "restructuring plan"). this plan includes a strategic shift in our approach to the healthcare surgical business in europe, as well as other actions including the impairment of an internally developed x-ray accelerator, product rationalizations and facility consolidations. less than 300 positions are being eliminated. these restructuring actions are designed to enhance profitability and improve efficiency, and we expect to be substantially complete with the actions by the end of fiscal 2025. we are anticipating improvements in income from operations of approximately $25.0 million per year, with the majority of the benefit being in fiscal 2026 and beyond due to timing of actions.
we have incurred pre-tax expenses totaling $44.4 million related to these restructurings in fiscal 2024, of which $26.1 million was recorded as restructuring expenses and $18.3 million was recorded in cost of revenues. a total of $19.0 million and $25.4 million was recorded to the healthcare and ast segments, respectively, while a total of $40.0 thousand was related to corporate. we expect to incur additional restructuring expenses related to this plan of approximately $55.3 million, which includes $51.3 million related to healthcare, $3.0 million related to ast, $0.8 million related to life sciences, and $0.2 million related to corporate. the $55.3 million is comprised of $36.2 million related to severance and other compensation related costs, $15.3 million related to lease and other contract termination and other costs, and $3.8 million related to accelerated depreciation and amortization.
the following table summarizes our total pre-tax restructuring expenses recorded in fiscal 2024 related to the restructuring plan:

business segment results of operations.
we operate and report our financial information in three reportable business segments: healthcare, ast, and life sciences. previously, we had four reportable business segments; however, as a result of the agreement to divest our dental segment, dental is presented as discontinued operations. historical information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect these changes for comparability, as required.
our healthcare segment provides a comprehensive offering for healthcare providers worldwide, focused on sterile processing departments and procedural centers, such as operating rooms and endoscopy suites. our products and services range from infection prevention consumables and capital equipment, as well as services to maintain that equipment; to the repair of re-usable procedural instruments; to outsourced instrument reprocessing services. in addition, our procedural solutions also include endoscopy accessories, instruments, and capital equipment infrastructure used primarily in operating rooms, ambulatory surgery centers, endoscopy suites, and other procedural areas.
our ast segment supports medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers through a global network of contract sterilization and laboratory testing facilities, and integrated sterilization equipment and control systems. our technology-neutral offering supports customers every step of the way, from testing through sterilization.
our life sciences segment provides a comprehensive offering of products and services designed to support biopharmaceutical and medical device research and manufacturing facilities, in particular those focused on aseptic manufacturing. our portfolio includes a full suite of consumable products, equipment maintenance, specialty services, and capital equipment.
we disclose a measure of segment income that is consistent with the way management operates and views the business. the accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated company.
for more information regarding our segments please refer to note 13 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "business segment information," and item 1, "business."

note: organic revenue growth and constant currency organic revenue growth are non-gaap financial measures of revenue performance. organic revenue growth is calculated by removing the impact of acquisitions and divestitures for one year following the respective transaction from the gaap revenue growth. constant currency organic revenue growth is subject to a further adjustment to eliminate the impact of foreign currency movements.
healthcare revenues increased 17.1% in fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, reflecting growth in capital equipment, consumable, and service revenues of 21.7%, 18.9%, 11.8%, respectively. the constant currency organic growth of 12.8% is primarily due to increased volume, impacting revenues by a low double digit percentage, as well as increased pricing.
the healthcare segment's backlog at march 31, 2024 amounted to $353.8 million. the healthcare segment's backlog at march 31, 2023 was $494.7 million. the decrease is due to increased shipments during fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023, resulting from shortened lead times and easing of supply chain constraints.
ast revenues increased 4.3% in fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023. the constant currency organic growth of 3.2% is primarily due to increased pricing, impacting revenues by a mid-single digit percentage, partially offset by lower volume. revenue was negatively impacted by medical device customer inventory management and the continued reduction in demand from bioprocessing customers.
life sciences revenues increased 6.5% in fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023 reflecting growth in service, capital equipment, and consumable revenues of 11.1%, 5.5%, 4.3% respectively. the constant currency organic growth of 5.8% is primarily due to increased pricing, impacting revenues by a mid-single digit percentage, as well as higher volume.
the life sciences backlog at march 31, 2024 and 2023 amounted to $71.4 million and $104.9 million, respectively. the decrease is primarily due to the timing of shipments and a decrease in orders as compared to the same period in the prior year.

material future cash obligations and commercial commitments cash requirements. we intend to use our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and meet our other liquidity needs. our capital requirements depend on many uncertain factors, including our rate of sales growth, our customers' acceptance of our products and services, the costs of obtaining adequate manufacturing capacities, the timing and extent of our research and development projects, changes in our operating expenses and other factors. to the extent that existing and anticipated sources of cash are not sufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the sale of equity securities. there can be no assurance that our financing arrangements will provide us with sufficient funds or that we will be able to obtain any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all.

supplemental guarantor financial information steris plc ("parent") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, limited and steris corporation (collectively "guarantors" and each a "guarantor"), each have provided guarantees of the obligations of finco, a wholly-owned subsidiary issuer, under senior public notes issued by finco on april 1, 2021 and of certain other obligations relating to the senior public notes. the senior public notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis. the senior public notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of finco and the guarantors, respectively, and are equal in priority with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the issuer and the guarantors, respectively, from time to time outstanding, including, as applicable, under the private placement senior notes, borrowings under the revolving credit facility, the term loan and the delayed draw term loan.
all of the liabilities of non-guarantor direct and indirect subsidiaries of steris, other than steris irish finco, steris limited and steris corporation, including any claims of trade creditors, are effectively senior to the senior public notes.
steris irish finco's main objective and source of revenues and cash flows is the provision of short- and long-term financing for the activities of steris plc and its subsidiaries.
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, interest and other fees to the issuer and ability of the issuer and guarantors to service the senior public notes may be restricted by, among other things, applicable corporate and other laws and regulations as well as agreements to which our subsidiaries are or may become a party.
the following is a summary of these guarantees:
guarantees of senior notes
•parent company guarantor - steris plc
•subsidiary issuer - steris irish finco unlimited company
•subsidiary guarantor - steris limited
•subsidiary guarantor - steris corporation the guarantee of a guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged:
•in the case of a subsidiary guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of such subsidiary guarantor, other than to the parent or a subsidiary of the parent and as permitted by the indenture;
•in the case of a subsidiary guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such subsidiary guarantor, other than to the parent or a subsidiary of the parent and as permitted by the indenture;
•in the case of a subsidiary guarantor, at such time as such subsidiary guarantor is no longer a borrower under or no longer guarantees any material credit facility (subject to restatement in specified circumstances);
•upon the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the notes or the discharge of the issuer's obligations under the indenture in accordance with the terms of the indenture;
•as described in accordance with the terms of the indenture; or
•in the case of the parent, if the issuer ceases for any reason to be a subsidiary of the parent; provided that all guarantees and other obligations of the parent in respect of all other indebtedness under any material credit facility of the issuer terminate upon the issuer ceasing to be a subsidiary of the parent; and
•upon such guarantor delivering to the trustee an officer's certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the indenture relating to such transaction or release have been complied with.
the obligations of each guarantor under its guarantee are expressly limited to the maximum amount that such guarantor could guarantee without such guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance. each guarantor that makes a payment under its guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the indenture to a contribution from each guarantor in an amount equal to such other guarantor's pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with u.s. gaap.
the following tables present summarized results of operations for the year ended march 31, 2024 and summarized balance sheet information at march 31, 2024 and 2023 for the obligor group of the senior public notes. the obligor group consists of the parent company guarantor, subsidiary issuer, and subsidiary guarantors for the senior public notes. the summarized financial information is presented after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the guarantors and issuer and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor or issuer. transactions with non-issuer and non-guarantor subsidiaries have been presented separately.

each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same. if our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted.
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the following subsections describe our most critical accounting estimates, and assumptions. our accounting policies and recently issued accounting pronouncements are more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies."
estimates and assumptions.  our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles. we make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when preparing these financial statements. these estimates and assumptions involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management's control. as a result, actual amounts could be materially different from these estimates. we periodically review these critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions, and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the company's board of directors.
revenue recognition.  revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of the promised products or services has transferred to the customer. revenues are measured at the amount of consideration that we expect to be paid in exchange for the products or services. product revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer, which is generally based on contract or shipping terms. service revenue is recognized when the customer benefits from the service, which occurs either upon completion of the service or as it is provided to the customer. our customers include end users as well as dealers and distributors who market and sell our products. our revenue is not contingent upon resale by the dealer or distributor, and we have no further obligations related to bringing about resale. our standard return and restocking fee policies are applied to sales of products. shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in product revenues. the associated expenses are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of revenues. revenues are reported net of sales and value-added taxes collected from customers.
we have individual customer contracts that offer discounted pricing. dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates. we reduce revenue for discounts and estimated returns, rebates, and other similar allowances in the same period the related revenues are recorded. the reduction in revenue for these items is estimated based on historical experience and trend analysis to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. estimated returns are recorded gross on the consolidated balance sheets.
in transactions that contain multiple performance obligations, such as when products, maintenance services, and other services are combined, we recognize revenue as each product is delivered or service is provided to the customer. we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is the price for the product or service when it is sold separately.
payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. we do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year.
we do not capitalize sales commissions as substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less.
certain costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract if they are recoverable, directly related to a contract and generate resources that we will use to fulfill the contract in the future. at march 31, 2024, assets related to costs to fulfill a contract were not material to our consolidated financial statements.
inventories and reserves. inventories are stated at the lower of their cost and net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out cost method. inventory costs include material, labor, and overhead.
we review inventory on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as deterioration and obsolescence. we record an allowance for estimated losses when the facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be usable. if future market conditions vary from those projected, and our estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to write-down inventory values and record an adjustment to cost of revenues.
asset impairment losses.  property, plant, equipment, and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. impaired assets are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value. we conduct this review on an ongoing basis and, if impairment exists, we record the loss in the consolidated statements of income during that period.
when we evaluate assets for impairment, we make certain judgments and estimates, including interpreting current economic indicators and market valuations, evaluating our strategic plans with regards to operations, historical and anticipated performance of operations, and other factors. if we incorrectly anticipate these factors, or unexpected events occur, our operating results could be materially affected.
purchase accounting and goodwill.  assets and liabilities of the business acquired are accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. we supplement management expertise with valuation specialists in performing appraisals to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. these valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. we generally amortize our intangible assets over their estimated useful lives with the exception of indefinite lived intangible assets. we do not amortize goodwill, but we evaluate it annually for impairment. therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on future operating results.
we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. we may consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. in those circumstances, we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. we calculate the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. management's judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. we evaluate several qualitative indicators and assumptions, and trends that influence the valuation of the assets to determine if any evidence of potential impairment exists.
income taxes.  our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in uncertain tax benefits, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities. we use judgment in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions. we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. we cannot be sure that the tax authorities will agree with all of the tax positions taken by us. the actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can, in some instances, ultimately be determined several years after the tax return is filed and the financial statements are published.
we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with current accounting guidance. we determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the appropriate unit of account for determining what constitutes an individual tax position, and whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position, is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence. we review and adjust our tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance, which would increase our effective income tax rate and could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period.
additional information regarding income taxes is included in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "income taxes."
self-insurance liabilities.  we record a liability for self-insured risks that we retain for general and product liabilities, workers' compensation, and automobile liabilities based on actuarial calculations. we use our historical loss experience and actuarial methods to calculate the estimated liability. this liability includes estimated amounts for both known losses and incurred but not reported claims. we review the assumptions used to calculate the estimated liability at least annually to evaluate the adequacy of the amount recorded. we maintain insurance policies to cover losses greater than our estimated liability, which are subject to the terms and conditions of those policies. the obligation covered by insurance contracts will remain on the balance sheet as we remain liable to the extent insurance carriers do not meet their obligation. estimated amounts receivable under the contracts are included in the "prepaid expenses and other current assets" line, and the "other assets" line of our consolidated balance sheets. our accrual for self-insured risk retention as of march 31, 2024 and 2023 was $30.7 million and $30.4 million, respectively and is included in accrued expenses and other and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
we are also self-insured for employee medical claims. we estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience. our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgments to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. if actual results are not consistent with these assumptions and judgments, we could be exposed to additional costs in subsequent periods.
contingencies.  we are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations, and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity, and the nature of our business, products, customers, regulatory environment, and industries in which we participate. these legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents), product liability or regulation (e.g., based on product operation or claimed malfunction, failure to warn, failure to meet specification, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), product exposure (e.g., claimed exposure to chemicals, gases, asbestos, contaminants, radiation), property damage (e.g., claimed damage due to leaking equipment, fire, vehicles, chemicals), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, warranty, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters), and other claims for damage and relief.
we record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable. we consider many factors in making these assessments, including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel. we have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses. in our opinion, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and claims is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. however, the ultimate outcome of proceedings, government investigations, and claims is unpredictable and actual results could be materially different from our estimates. we record expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies" for additional information.
we are subject to taxation from federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions. tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation. changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates. the irs of the united states routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns.
additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies is included in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies."
benefit plans.  we provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and retirees. in addition, we sponsor an unfunded post-retirement benefits plan for two groups of united states retirees. benefits under this plan include retiree life insurance and retiree medical insurance, including prescription drug coverage.
employee pension and post-retirement benefits plans are a cost of conducting business and represent obligations that will be settled in the future and therefore, require us to use estimates and make certain assumptions to calculate the expense and liabilities related to the plans. changes to these estimates and assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. future actual experience may be significantly different from our current expectations. we believe that the most critical assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. a summary of significant assumptions used to determine the march 31, 2024 projected benefit obligations and the fiscal 2024 net periodic benefit costs is as follows:

we develop our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisors, taking into consideration the asset allocation of the portfolios, and the long-term asset class return expectations. generally, net periodic benefit costs increase as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption decreases. holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for our funded defined benefit pension plans by 50 basis points would have increased the fiscal 2024 benefit costs by less than $0.2 million.
we develop our discount rate assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisers, taking into consideration the current yield on country specific investment grade long-term bonds which provide for similar cash flow streams as our projected benefit obligations. generally, the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs both increase as the discount rate assumption decreases. holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the discount rate assumption for our defined benefit pension plans and for the other post-retirement benefits plan by 50 basis points would have decreased the fiscal 2024 net periodic benefit costs by less than $0.1 million and would have increased the projected benefit obligations by approximately $8.0 million at march 31, 2024.
we have made assumptions regarding healthcare costs in computing our other post-retirement benefit obligation. the assumed rates of increase generally decline ratably over a five year-period from the assumed current year healthcare cost trend rate of 7.5% to the assumed long-term healthcare cost trend rate. a 100 basis point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate (including medical, prescription drug, and long-term rates) would have had the following effect at march 31, 2024:

we recognize an asset for the overfunded status or a liability for the underfunded status of defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans in our balance sheets. this amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for other post-retirement benefit plans). changes in the funded status of the plans are recorded in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. we measure plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date. note 11 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "benefit plans," contains additional information about our pension and other post-retirement welfare benefits plans.

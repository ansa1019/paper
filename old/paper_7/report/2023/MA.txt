business overview mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry. we connect consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those payment transactions safe, simple, smart, and accessible. we make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known and trusted brands, including mastercard®, maestro® and cirrus®. we operate a multi-rail payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and our customers. through our unique and proprietary core global payments network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions. we have additional payments capabilities that include automated clearing house ("ach") transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments). using these capabilities, we offer payment products and services and capture new payment flows. our value-added services include, among others, cyber and intelligence solutions designed to allow all parties to transact securely, easily and with confidence, as well as other services that provide proprietary insights, drawing on our principled and responsible use of secure consumer and merchant data. our investments in new networks, such as open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities, support and strengthen our payments and services solutions. each of our capabilities support and build upon each other and are fundamentally interdependent. for our core global payments network, our franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. we employ a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which we operate.
mastercard is not a financial institution. we do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants' acceptance of our products. in most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.

key highlights for 2023 as compared to 2022 were as follows:
net revenue       adjusted net revenue gaap              non-gaap                   both the as reported and as adjusted net revenue increase was attributable to growth in our payment network and value-added services and solutions.
(currency-neutral)
up 13%            up 13%
operating expenses         adjusted operating expenses gaap                       non-gaap                   both the as reported and as adjusted operating expenses increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs and includes 1 percentage point of growth due to acquisitions.
(currency-neutral)
up 11%                     up 11%
effective income tax rate        adjusted effective income tax rate gaap                             non-gaap                                  both the as reported and as adjusted effective income tax rates were higher than the prior year rates primarily due to the release of a $333 million valuation allowance in 2022 and the establishment of a $327 million valuation allowance in 2023, partially offset by the ability to claim more u.s. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023.
17.9%                            18.5%
other 2023 financial highlights were as follows:
•we generated net cash flows from operations of $12.0 billion.
•we repurchased 23.8 million shares of our common stock for $9.0 billion and paid dividends of $2.2 billion.
•we completed a debt offering for an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion.
mastercard 2023 form 10-k part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non-gaap financial information non-gaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company's performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"). our non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition and the related tax impacts. our non-gaap financial measures also exclude the impact of special items, where applicable, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts ("special items"). we also present growth rates adjusted for the impact of currency, which is a non-gaap financial measure. we believe that the non-gaap financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods. we use non-gaap financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. we excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items. net revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other income (expense), effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, special items and/or the impact of currency should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with gaap.
our non-gaap financial measures for the comparable periods exclude the impact of the following:
gains and losses on equity investments
•during 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded net pre-tax losses of $61 million ($36 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted share), net pre-tax losses of $145 million ($126 million after tax, or $0.13 per diluted share) and net pre-tax gains of $645 million ($497 million after tax, or $0.50 per diluted share), respectively. these net gains and losses were primarily related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities. in addition, in 2021, net gains also included realized gains on sales of marketable equity securities.
special items litigation provisions
•during 2023, we recorded pre-tax charges of $539 million ($376 million after tax, or $0.40 per diluted share) related to litigation provisions, which included pre-tax charges of:
◦$344 million as a result of changes in the estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the u.s. merchant class litigation, and
◦$195 million as a result of settlements with a number of u.k. and pan-european merchants.
•during 2022, we recorded pre-tax charges of $356 million ($263 million after tax, or $0.27 per diluted share) related to litigation provisions, which included pre-tax charges of:
◦$223 million as a result of settlements (both final and agreements in principle) with a number of u.k. merchants, and
◦$133 million as a result of a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the u.s. merchant class litigation.
•during 2021, we recorded pre-tax charges of $94 million ($74 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) related to litigation settlements and estimated attorneys' fees with u.k. and pan-european merchants.
russia-related impacts
•during 2022, we recorded a net pre-tax charge of $30 million ($24 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share), directly related to imposed sanctions and the suspension of our business operations in russia. the net charge was comprised of general and administrative expenses of $67 million, primarily related to incremental employee-related costs and reserves on uncollectible balances with certain sanctioned customers. this charge was offset by net benefits of $37 million in net revenue, primarily related to a reduction in payment network rebates and incentives liabilities as a result of lower estimates of customer performance for certain customer business agreements due to the suspension of our business operations in russia.
indirect tax matter
•during 2021, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $88 million ($69 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) to resolve a foreign indirect tax matter for 2015 through 2021 and the related interest expense. the charge was comprised of general and administrative expenses of $82 million and other income (expense) of $6 million.
mastercard 2023 form 10-k part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see note 7 (investments) and note 21 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for further discussion related to certain of our non-gaap financial measures.
currency-neutral growth rates currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period's results using the current period's exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results and are non-gaap financial measures. the impact of currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our u.s. dollar reporting currency. the impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. the impact of the related realized gains and losses resulting from our foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments is recognized in the respective financial statement line item on the statement of operations when the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings. we believe the presentation of currency-neutral growth rates provides relevant information to facilitate an understanding of our operating results.
the translational and transactional impact of currency and the related impact of our foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments ("currency impact") has been excluded from our currency-neutral growth rates and has been identified in the non-gaap information below and our "drivers of change" tables. see "foreign currency - currency impact" for further information on our currency impacts and "financial results - net revenue" and "financial results - operating expenses" for our "drivers of change" tables.

** not applicable key metrics and drivers in addition to the financial measures described above in "financial results overview", we review the following metrics to evaluate and identify trends in our business, measure our performance, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. we believe that the key metrics presented facilitate an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.
operating margin measures how much profit we make on each dollar of sales after our operating costs but before other income (expense) and income tax expense. operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.
key drivers gross dollar volume ("gdv")1 measures dollar volume of activity, including both domestic and cross-border volume, on cards carrying our brands during the period, on a local currency basis and u.s. dollar-converted basis. gdv represents purchase volume plus cash volume; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks obtained with mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period. information denominated in u.s. dollars relating to gdv is calculated by applying an established u.s. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. these exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter.  we report period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the u.s. dollar in calculating such rates of change.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cross-border volume growth2 measures the growth of cross-border dollar volume during the period, on a local currency basis and u.s. dollar-converted basis, for all mastercard-branded programs.
switched transactions2 measures the number of transactions switched by mastercard, which is defined as the number of transactions initiated and switched through our network during the period.
1    data used in the calculation of gdv is provided by mastercard customers and is subject to verification by mastercard and partial cross-checking against information provided by mastercard's transaction switching systems. all data is subject to revision and amendment by mastercard or mastercard's customers. starting in the first quarter of 2022, data related to sanctioned russian banks was not reported to us and therefore such amounts are not included. subsequent to the suspension of our business operations in russia in march 2022, there is no russian data to be reported.
2    growth rates are normalized to eliminate the effects of differing switching and carryover days between periods, as needed. carryover days are those where transactions and volumes from days where the company does not clear and settle are processed.
the following tables provide a summary of the growth trends in our key drivers.

•domestic assessments are charges based on activity related to cards that carry the company's brands where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same. these assessments are primarily driven by the domestic dollar volume of activity (e.g., domestic purchase volume, domestic cash volume) or the number of cards issued.
•cross-border assessments are charges based on activity related to cards that carry the company's brands where the merchant country and the country of issuance are different. these assessments are primarily driven by the cross-border dollar volume of activity (e.g., cross-border purchase volume, cross-border cash volume).

•transaction processing assessments are charges primarily driven by the number of switched transactions on our payment network. switching activities include:
◦authorization, the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval
◦clearing, the determination and exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction
◦settlement, which facilitates the determination and exchange of funds between parties these assessments can also include connectivity services and network access which are based on the volume of data transmitted and the number of authorization and settlement messages.
•other network assessments are primarily charges for licensing, implementation and other franchise fees.

foreign currency currency impact our primary revenue functional currencies are the u.s. dollar, euro, british pound and the brazilian real. our overall operating results are impacted by currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our u.s. dollar reporting currency.
our operating results are also impacted by transactional currency. the impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. changes in currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume ("gdv"), which are used in the calculation of our key metrics related to domestic assessments and cross-border assessments as well as certain volume-related rebates and incentives. gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to u.s. dollars and euros using average exchange rates for the period. as a result, our key metrics related to domestic assessments and cross-border assessments as well as certain volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar and euro versus local currencies. for example, our billing in australia is in the u.s. dollar, however, consumer spend in australia is in the australian dollar. the transactional currency impact of converting australian dollars to our u.s. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated. the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar is evident when gdv growth on a u.s. dollar-converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis. in 2023, gdv on a u.s. dollar-converted basis increased 10.4%, while gdv on a local currency basis increased 11.9% versus 2022. in 2022, gdv on a u.s. dollar-converted basis increased 5.9%, while gdv on a local currency basis increased 12.3% versus 2021. further, the impact from transactional currency occurs in our key metric related to transaction processing assessments as well as value-added services and solutions revenue and operating expenses when the transacting currency of these items is different than the functional currency of the entity.
to manage the impact of foreign currency variability on anticipated revenues and expenses, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts and designate such derivatives as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship as discussed further in note 23 (derivative and hedging instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8.

no individual country, other than the united states, generated more than 10% of net revenue in any such period. a significant portion of our net revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. in 2023, the net revenue from these customers was approximately $5.6 billion, or 22%, of total net revenue. the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue.
operating expenses operating expenses increased 11% in 2023 versus the prior year. adjusted operating expenses increased 10%, or 11% on a currency-neutral basis, versus the prior year, which includes a 1 percentage point increase from acquisitions. on both an as reported and as adjusted basis, the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the continued investment in our business and the delivery of services to our customers.

general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased 11% on an as reported and currency-neutral basis, in 2023 versus the prior year. current year results include growth of 1 percentage point from acquisitions. the remaining increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs resulting from incremental headcount to support the continued investment in our business and the delivery of services to our customers.

income taxes the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 were 17.9% and 15.4%, respectively. the adjusted effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 were 18.5% and 15.7%, respectively. both the as reported and as adjusted effective income tax rates were higher in 2023, primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance associated with the deferred tax asset related to u.s. foreign tax credits. in 2022, we recognized a discrete tax benefit of $333 million to release the valuation allowance resulting from u.s. tax regulations published in the first quarter of 2022 (the "2022 regulations"). in 2023, the treatment of foreign taxes paid under the 2022 regulations changed due to the foreign tax legislation enacted in brazil and notice 2023-55 (the "notice"), released by the u.s. department of treasury ("treasury"). therefore, we recognized a total $327 million discrete tax expense in 2023 to establish the valuation allowance. the discrete tax expense recognized in 2023 was partially offset by our ability to claim more u.s. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023 due to the notice released by treasury.
the organization for economic co-operation and development ("oecd") pillar 2 guidelines published to date include transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the pillar 2 global minimum tax of 15%. based on current enacted legislation effective in 2024 and our structure, we do not expect a material impact in 2024. we are monitoring developments and evaluating the impacts these new rules will have on our future effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.
see note 20 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources we rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations. the following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit available to us at december 31:

1investments include available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities. this amount excludes restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, our cash flow generating capabilities, and our access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations and potential obligations which include litigation provisions and credit and settlement exposure.
our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions. we guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our customers. historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be indicative of potential future losses. the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven by regional or global economic and market conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region. see note 22 (settlement and other risk management) to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 for a description of these guarantees.
our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see part i, item 1a - risk factors - legal and regulatory risks and note 21 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8.

net cash used in financing activities                      (9,488)                          (10,328)                         (6,555)
net cash provided by operating activities increased $0.8 billion in 2023 versus the prior year, primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for non-cash items and an increase in restricted security deposits held for customers, partially offset by restricted cash paid for litigation settlement, higher employee incentives paid and higher customer incentives payments.
net cash used in investing activities decreased $0.1 billion in 2023 versus the prior year, primarily due to less cash paid for business acquisitions in the current year, partially offset by an increase in purchases of investments in time deposits.
net cash used in financing activities decreased $0.8 billion in 2023 versus the prior year, primarily due to lower debt payments and higher proceeds from debt issuances in the current year, partially offset by higher repurchases of our class a common stock and higher dividend payments.
mastercard 2023 form 10-k part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations debt and credit availability in march 2023, we issued $750 million principal amount of notes due march 2028 and $750 million principal amount of notes due march 2033 (collectively the "2023 usd notes"). the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 usd notes, after deducting the original issue discount, underwriting discount and offering expenses, were $1.489 billion. in april 2023, we entered into an additional unsecured inr4.97 billion ($61 million as of the date of settlement) term loan, originally due july 2023 (the "april 2023 inr term loan"). in july 2023, we modified and combined the existing 2022 inr term loan and april 2023 inr term loan (the "2023 inr term loan"), increasing the total unsecured loans to inr28.1 billion ($342 million as of the date of settlement). the 2023 inr term loan is due july 2024.
our total debt outstanding was $15.7 billion at december 31, 2023, with the earliest maturity of $1.0 billion of principal occurring in april 2024.
as of december 31, 2023, we have a commercial paper program (the "commercial paper program"), under which we are authorized to issue up to $8 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. in conjunction with the commercial paper program, we have a committed unsecured $8 billion revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") which now expires in november 2028.
borrowings under the commercial paper program and the credit facility are to be used to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers. in addition, we may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes. we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program or the credit facility at december 31, 2023.
see note 15 (debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion on our debt, the commercial paper program and the credit facility.
dividends and share repurchases we have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock. subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend. the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.
the following table summarizes the annual, per share dividends paid in the years reflected:

on december 5, 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.66 per share paid on february 9, 2024 to holders of record on january 9, 2024 of our class a common stock and class b common stock. the aggregate amount of this dividend was $616 million.
on february 6, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.66 per share payable on may 9, 2024 to holders of record on april 9, 2024 of our class a common stock and class b common stock. the aggregate amount of this dividend is estimated to be $616 million.
mastercard 2023 form 10-k part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations repurchased shares of our common stock are considered treasury stock. in december 2023, december 2022 and november 2021, our board of directors approved share repurchase programs of our class a common stock authorizing us to repurchase up to $11.0 billion, $9.0 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively. the program approved in 2023 will become effective after the completion of the share repurchase program approved in 2022. the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including cash requirements to meet the operating needs of the business, legal requirements, as well as the share price and economic and market conditions. the following table summarizes our share repurchase authorizations and repurchase activity of our class a common stock through december 31, 2023:
(in millions, except per share data)
remaining authorization at december 31, 2022                                    $12,174

remaining authorization at december 31, 2023                                    $14,142
shares repurchased in 2023                         23.8
average price paid per share in 2023                                            $379.49
1    the dollar-value of shares repurchased does not include a 1% excise tax that became effective january 1, 2023. the incremental tax is recorded in treasury stock on the consolidated balance sheet and is payable annually beginning in 2024.
see note 16 (stockholders' equity) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion.
critical accounting estimates the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8.
revenue recognition - rebates and incentives we enter into business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates and incentives when customers meet certain volume thresholds or other incentives tied to customer performance. we consider various factors in estimating customer performance, including forecasted transactions, card issuance and card conversion volumes, expected payments and historical experience with that customer. rebates and incentives are recorded within net revenue based on these estimates primarily when volume- and transaction- based revenues are recognized over the contractual term. differences between actual results and our estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance. if our customers' actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, net revenue may be materially different.
loss contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. as additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes.
income taxes in calculating our effective income tax rate, estimates are required regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions. through our interpretation of local tax regulations, adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings. although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts.
mastercard 2023 form 10-k part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all sources of taxable income, including projected future taxable income, reversing taxable temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset, we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made, with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings.
we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. we consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and, if so, how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements. if upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained, this would generally increase earnings in the period. in certain situations, we will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions.
deferred taxes are established on the estimated foreign exchange gains or losses for foreign earnings that are not considered permanently reinvested, which will be recognized through cumulative translation adjustments as incurred. ultimately, the working capital requirements of foreign affiliates will determine the amount of cash to be remitted from respective jurisdictions.
business combinations we account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. the acquisition purchase price, including contingent consideration, if any, is allocated to the underlying identified, tangible and intangible assets, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date. any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill. the amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related tangible and intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. we use various valuation techniques to determine fair value, primarily discounted cash flows analysis, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings for estimating the value of intangible assets. these valuation techniques include comparable company multiples, discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the expected useful lives, requires management's judgment. the significance of management's estimates and assumptions is relative to the size of the acquisition. our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.

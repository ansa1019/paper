executive summary this executive summary provides highlights from the results of operations that follow:
•revenue increased by $23.6 billion, or 9.9%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to revenue growth in our u.s. healthcare solutions segment. the u.s. healthcare solutions segment grew its revenue by $22.7 billion, or 10.7%, from the prior fiscal year due to overall market growth primarily driven by unit volume growth, including increased sales of products labeled for diabetes and/or weight loss in the glucagon-like peptide-1, or "glp-1," class and increased sales of specialty products to physician practices and health systems, offset in part by a decrease in sales of covid-19 treatments (primarily commercial treatments). revenue in international healthcare solutions increased by $0.9 billion, or 3.5%, from the prior fiscal year due to increased sales at alliance healthcare, our european distribution business, increased revenue from our less-than-wholly-owned brazil full-line distribution business, incremental revenue from our january 2023 acquisition of pharmalex, increased sales at our canadian business, and was offset in part due to the june 2022 divestiture of our brazil specialty business. our european distribution business' revenue in the current fiscal year was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the prior fiscal year;
•gross profit increased by $663.1 million, or 8.0%, from the prior fiscal year. gross profit in the current fiscal year was favorably impacted by increases in gross profit in both reportable segments and an increase in gains from antitrust litigation settlements, offset in part by an increase in last-in, first-out ("lifo") expense in the current fiscal year. u.s. healthcare solutions' gross profit increased by $366.4 million, or 6.7%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased sales. gross profit in international healthcare solutions increased $243.7 million, or 8.3%, from the prior fiscal year due to the january 2023 acquisition of pharmalex and increases in our global specialty logistics business, our european distribution business, and our less-than-wholly-owned brazil full-line distribution business, offset in part by the june 2022 divestiture of our brazil specialty business. our european distribution business' gross profit in the current fiscal year was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the prior fiscal year;
•total operating expenses increased by $688.8 million, or 11.6%, from the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of increases in distribution, selling, and administrative expenses, amortization expense, and restructuring and other expenses, offset in part by a litigation and opioid-related credit in the current fiscal year in comparison to an expense in the prior fiscal year and a $75.9 million goodwill impairment recorded in the prior fiscal year;
•total segment operating income increased by $125.7 million, or 4.0%, from the prior fiscal year due to operating income growth in the u.s. healthcare solutions segment, offset in part by a decrease in operating income in the international healthcare solutions segment resulting from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the prior fiscal year; and
•our effective tax rates were 19.8% and 23.7% for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 was lower than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of non-u.s. income taxed at rates lower than the u.s. statutory rate, benefits from tax authority audit resolutions, and tax benefits associated with the vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises, offset in part by u.s. state income taxes. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 was higher than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to u.s. state income taxes, offset in part by the benefit of non-u.s. income taxed at rates lower than the u.s. statutory rate.

our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors, such as industry growth trends, including drug utilization (e.g. products labeled for diabetes and/or weight loss in the glp-1 class), the introduction of new, innovative brand therapies, the likely increase in the number of generic drugs and biosimilars that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs and biosimilars, price inflation and price deflation, general economic conditions in the united states and europe, currency exchange rates, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third-party reimbursement rates to our customers, changes in government rules and regulations, and the impact of covid-19.
revenue increased by 9.9% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth in the u.s. healthcare solutions segment.
the u.s. healthcare solutions segment grew its revenue by $22.7 billion, or 10.7%, from the prior fiscal year due to overall market growth primarily driven by unit volume growth, including increased sales of products labeled for diabetes and/or weight loss in the glp-1 class and increased sales of specialty products to physician practices and health systems, offset in part by a decrease in sales of covid-19 treatments (primarily commercial treatments). the total increase in u.s. healthcare solutions revenues included increases in sales of products labeled for diabetes and/or weight loss of $7.7 billion from the prior fiscal year. covid-19 treatment revenue declined by $1.0 billion in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 in comparison to the prior fiscal year. sales, including glp-1 products and covid-19 treatments, to our two largest customers increased by $7.7 billion from the prior fiscal year.
revenue in international healthcare solutions increased by $0.9 billion, or 3.5%, from the prior fiscal year due to increased sales at alliance healthcare, our european distribution business, increased revenue from our less-than-wholly-owned brazil full-line distribution business, incremental revenue from our january 2023 acquisition of pharmalex, and increased sales at our canadian business. these increases were offset in part due to the june 2022 divestiture of our brazil specialty business. our european distribution business' revenue in the current fiscal year was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the prior fiscal year.
a number of our contracts with customers, including group purchasing organizations, are typically subject to expiration each year. we may lose a significant customer if an existing contract with such customer expires without being extended, renewed, or replaced. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023, no significant contracts expired. over the next twelve months, there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire. additionally, from time to time, significant contracts may be terminated in accordance with their terms or extended, renewed, or replaced prior to their expiration dates. if those contracts are extended, renewed, or replaced at less favorable terms, they may also negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.

gross profit increased by $663.1 million, or 8.0%, from the prior fiscal year. gross profit in the current fiscal year was favorably impacted by increases in gross profit in both reportable segments and an increase in gains from antitrust litigation settlements, offset in part by an increase in lifo expense.
u.s. healthcare solutions gross profit increased by $366.4 million, or 6.7%, from the prior fiscal year due to increased sales. as a percentage of revenue, u.s. healthcare solutions' gross profit margin of 2.48% in the current fiscal year decreased 9 basis points compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher sales of glp-1 products, which have lower gross profit margins, and lower sales of covid-19 treatments, which have higher gross profit margins.
gross profit in international healthcare solutions increased $243.7 million, or 8.3%, from the prior fiscal year due to the january 2023 acquisition of pharmalex and increases in our global specialty logistics business, our european distribution business, and our less-than-wholly-owned brazil full-line distribution business, offset in part by the june 2022 divestiture of our brazil specialty business. our european distribution business' gross profit in the current fiscal year was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the prior fiscal year.
we recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of $239.1 million and $1.8 million in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold (see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements).
our cost of goods sold includes a lifo provision that is affected by manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, changes in inventory quantities, and product mix, many of which are difficult to predict. changes to any of the above factors may have a material impact on our annual lifo provision. the increase in lifo expense in the current fiscal year was primarily driven by lower generic pharmaceutical deflation and higher brand inventory product mix, offset in part by lower brand pharmaceutical inflation.
we recognized an expense in cost of goods sold of $87.0 million and $40.0 million in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the impact of turkey highly inflationary accounting. the expense recognized in each period was driven by the continued weakening of the turkish lira.

distribution, selling, and administrative expenses increased by $461.0 million, or 9.5%, from the prior fiscal year. the increase from the prior fiscal year was primarily to support revenue growth and included inflationary impacts on certain operating expenses. as a percentage of revenue, distribution, selling, and administrative expenses were 2.03% in the current fiscal year and was flat compared to the prior fiscal year as inflationary impacts on certain operating expenses were offset in part by recent initiatives undertaken to improve operating efficiency across many of our businesses and administrative functions.
depreciation expense increased 6.1% from the prior fiscal year. amortization expense increased 80.1% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to accelerated amortization expense recorded in connection with the shortened useful lives of certain trade names resulting from our company name change and the gradual transition away from other tradenames used, which were acquired through prior acquisitions.
litigation and opioid-related credit in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 included the receipt of $83.4 million from the h.d. smith opioid litigation indemnity escrow. litigation and opioid-related credit was offset in part by $58.7 million of legal fees in connection with opioid lawsuits and investigations in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023. litigation and opioid-related expenses in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 included a $36.6 million accrual related to opioid litigation settlements and $86.6 million of legal fees in connection with opioid lawsuits and investigations.

u.s. healthcare solutions operating income increased $139.6 million, or 5.7%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in gross profit, as noted above, and was offset in part by an increase in operating expenses. as a percentage of revenue, u.s. healthcare solutions operating income margin was 1.11% and represented a decrease of 5 basis points compared to the prior fiscal year. the decrease from the prior year fiscal year was primarily due to the declines in gross profit margins, as described above in the gross profit section.
operating income in international healthcare solutions decreased by $13.9 million, or 2.0%, from the prior fiscal year due to a decrease in operating income in our european distribution business primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the prior fiscal year and a significant decline in operating income at its less-than-wholly-owned subsidiary in egypt (that was divested on september 30, 2023), and the june 2022 divestiture of our brazil specialty business. the above-mentioned declines were offset in part by the strong performance of our global specialty logistics business.
other income, net included in other income, net, we recognized $40.7 million and $56.2 million from the divestiture of non-core businesses in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
interest expense, net interest expense, net and the respective weighted average interest rates were as follows:

interest expense, net increased $18.3 million, or 8.7%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in interest expense. the increase in interest expense was primarily driven by an increase in our variable-rate borrowings and associated interest rates. the increase in interest expense was offset in part by an increase in interest income, which was primarily driven by higher investment interest rates in the current fiscal year in comparison to the prior fiscal year. the higher investment interest rates were offset in part by a lower average investment cash balance in the current fiscal year in comparison to the prior fiscal year.
income tax expense our effective tax rates were 19.8% and 23.7% in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 was lower than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of non-u.s. income taxed at rates lower than the u.s. statutory rate, benefits from tax authority audit resolutions, and tax benefits associated with the vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises, offset in part by u.s. state income taxes. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 was higher than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to u.s. state income taxes, offset in part by the benefit of non-u.s. income taxed at rates lower than the u.s. statutory rate.
fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2021
for a discussion of the comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2022 and 2021, refer to the management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section in our previously filed annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022.
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management's judgment. actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates. below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions. for a complete list of significant accounting policies, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
allowances for returns and credit losses trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for customer sales returns and an allowance for credit losses. our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit. we record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends. the allowance for returns as of september 30, 2023 and 2022 was $1,314.9 million and $1,532.1 million, respectively.
we evaluate our receivables for risk of loss by grouping our receivables with similar risk characteristics. expected losses are determined based on a combination of historical loss trends, current economic conditions, and forward-looking risk factors. changes in these factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in our allowance for credit losses. the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by management as to the impact of those and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables. we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and maintain reserves for expected credit losses and specific credit problems when they arise. we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote. we perform formal, documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and perform monthly credit loss reviews in connection with our largest businesses and our higher risk customer accounts. there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods. the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for credit losses, net of write-offs, recoveries, and other adjustments.
bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $54.4 million, $26.1 million, and $12.1 million respectively. an increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2023 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately $21.0 million. the allowance for credit losses was $118.5 million and $94.7 million as of september 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
schedule ii of this form 10-k sets forth a rollforward of allowances for returns and credit losses.
business combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at estimated fair value, with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. we engage third-party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. these estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to: discount rates and expected future cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships, trade names, existing technology, and other intangible assets. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill arises from acquisitions or consolidations of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. we identify our reporting units based upon our management reporting structure, beginning with our operating segments. we aggregate two or more components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. we evaluate whether the components within our operating segments have similar economic characteristics, which include the similarity of long-term gross margins, the nature of the components' products, services, and production processes, the types of customers and the methods by which products or services are delivered to customers, and the components' regulatory environment. as of september 30, 2023, our reporting units include u.s. pharmaceutical distribution services, u.s. consulting services, mwi animal health, alliance healthcare, innomar, world courier, pharmalex, and profarma.
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as certain trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. for the purpose of these impairment tests, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. such qualitative factors can include, among others, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and relevant entity-specific events. if we conclude based on our qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative analysis. we elected to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill for our reporting units in fiscal 2023 and 2022 with the exception of our pharmalex reporting unit, which was recently acquired. we elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2023 and a quantitative impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2022. we elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2021, with the exception of our testing of goodwill in the amerisourcebergen consulting services (the sum of u.s. consulting service and innomar reporting units, under our prior reporting structure) and profarma reporting units.
the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required, and no impairment loss is recognized. if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, the amount of which may not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
when performing a quantitative impairment assessment, we utilize an income approach or a weighted-average of an income and market approach to value our reporting units. the income approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate, to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. we generally believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our reporting units in a sale transaction. the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements, which are based upon our long-range plan. the discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity, including a risk premium. while we use the best available information to prepare our forecasted cash flows and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows and/or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged.
the quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (certain trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. we estimate the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method, which is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such indefinite-lived trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021. we recorded goodwill impairments of $75.9 million and $6.4 million in our profarma reporting unit in connection with our fiscal 2022 and 2021 impairment tests (see note 5), respectively. no goodwill impairments were recorded in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023, and no indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023, 2022, or 2021.
finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. we perform a recoverability assessment of our long-lived assets when impairment indicators are present.
income taxes our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect management's assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements. deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes.
we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually. after application of the valuation allowances described above, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above.
we prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these judgments and interpretations. in the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions' tax court systems. significant judgment is exercised in applying complex tax laws and regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based upon the technical merits of the position.
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances. however, others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued.
the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year. if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change, an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by $21.6 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023.
for a complete discussion of the tax impact of uk tax reform and swiss tax reform, refer to note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. cost for approximately 66% of our inventories as of september 30, 2023 and 2022 has been determined using the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method. if we had used the first-in, first-out method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $1,588.0 million and $1,383.4 million higher than the amounts reported as of september 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we recorded lifo expense of $204.6 million and $67.2 million in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we recorded a lifo credit of $203.0 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2021. the annual lifo provision is affected by manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, changes in inventory quantities, and product mix, many of which are difficult to predict. changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual lifo provision.
loss contingencies in the ordinary course of business, we become involved in lawsuits, administrative proceedings, government subpoenas, government investigations, stockholder demands, and other disputes, including antitrust, commercial, product liability, intellectual property, regulatory, employment discrimination, and other matters. significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters, and some matters may require years to resolve. we record a liability when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued. if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency and whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can made in the footnotes to our financial statements. we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. among the loss contingencies we considered in accordance with the foregoing in connection with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements were the opioid matters described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources our operating results have generated cash flows, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, have provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, and purchases of shares of our common stock.
our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund the payment of dividends, fund purchases of our common stock, finance acquisitions, and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including the opioid litigation payments that will be made over the next 15 years (see below).
cash flows as of september 30, 2023 and 2022, our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $640.5 million and $688.4 million, respectively. we have the ability to repatriate the majority of our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without incurring significant additional taxes upon repatriation.
we have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the december and march quarters that, depending on our cash balance, may require the use of our credit facilities to fund short-term capital needs. our cash balances in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022 were supplemented by intra-period credit facility borrowings to cover short-term working capital needs. the largest amount of intra-period borrowings under our revolving and securitization credit facilities that was outstanding at any one time during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022 was $2,121.0 million and $590.0 million, respectively. we had $77,851.0 million, $4,435.9 million, and $4,730.5 million of cumulative intra-period borrowings that were repaid under our credit facilities during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023, our operating activities provided cash of $3,911.3 million and was principally the result of the following:
•an increase in accounts payable of $6,103.5 million primarily due to the increase in our inventory balances and the timing of scheduled payments to our suppliers;
•net income of $1,732.6 million;
•positive non-cash items of $1,304.2 million, which is primarily comprised of amortization expense of $562.0 million, depreciation expense of $418.8 million, and lifo expense of $204.6 million, offset in part by:
◦an increase in accounts receivable of $2,711.8 million primarily due to an increase in sales and the timing of scheduled payments from our customers;
◦an increase in inventories of $2,183.4 million to support the increase in business volume; and
◦a decrease in long-term accrued litigation liability of $400.0 million due to opioid litigation settlement payments.
during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2022, our operating activities provided cash of $2,703.1 million and was principally the result of the following:
•an increase in accounts payable of $3,320.7 million primarily due to the increase in our inventory balances and the timing of scheduled payments to our suppliers;
•net income of $1,666.5 million;
•positive non-cash items of $1,176.2 million, which is primarily comprised of depreciation expense of $390.6 million, amortization expense of $319.2 million, and the provision for deferred income taxes of $196.2 million, offset in part by:
◦an increase in accounts receivable of $1,659.5 million primarily due to an increase in sales and the timing of scheduled payments from our customers;
◦an increase in inventories of $665.4 million to support the increase in business volume;
◦a decrease in long-term accrued litigation liability of $500.2 million due to opioid litigation settlement payments;
◦a decrease in accrued expenses of $457.2 million; and
◦a decrease in income taxes payable and other liabilities of $330.1 million.
we use days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand, and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance. the below financial metrics are calculated based upon a quarterly average and can be impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, which can vary significantly depending upon the day of the week in which the month ends.

our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based upon fluctuations in our period-end working capital account balances. additionally, any changes to payment terms with a significant customer or manufacturer supplier could have a material impact to our cash flows from operations. operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 included $271.3 million of interest payments and $463.1 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 included $219.8 million of interest payments and $244.4 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2021 included $170.9 million of interest payments and $93.5 million of income tax payments, net of refunds.
capital expenditures in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $458.4 million, $496.3 million, and $438.2 million, respectively. significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 and 2022 included investments in various technology initiatives, including technology initiatives at alliance healthcare. significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 included costs associated with facility expansions and various technology initiatives, including costs related to enhancing and upgrading our primary information technology operating systems.
we currently expect to spend approximately $500 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2024. larger 2024 capital expenditures will include investments relating to various technology initiatives, including technology investments at alliance healthcare.
in addition to capital expenditures, net cash used in investing activities in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 included $1,406.5 million for the acquisition of pharmalex and $718.4 million for our investment in oneoncology (see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements).
in addition to capital expenditures, net cash used in investing activities in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 included $133.8 million of cash to acquire companies, including $60.0 million that was paid to settle accrued consideration related to the alliance healthcare acquisition (see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements), and was offset in part by $272.6 million in proceeds from the divestiture of non-core businesses.
in addition to capital expenditures, net cash used in investing activities in the fiscal year ended 2021 included $5,563.0 million of cash to acquire companies, which principally related to the june 2021 acquisition of alliance healthcare, net of cash acquired, and $162.6 million for equity investments.
net cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 principally resulted from $1,180.7 million purchases of our common stock, a $675 million repayment of our 0.737% senior notes that matured in march 2023, and $398.8 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock.
net cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 principally resulted from an $850 million repayment of our 0.737% senior notes that matured in 2023, the repayment of our $250 million term loan, $391.7 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock, and $483.7 million in purchases of our common stock.

in march 2021, we issued $1,525 million of 0.737% senior notes due march 15, 2023 (the "2023 notes"). the 2023 notes were sold at 100.00% of the principal amount. interest on the 2023 notes was payable semi-annually in arrears and commenced on september 15, 2021. in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022, we elected to repay $850 million of 2023 notes due in march 2023. in march 2023, the remaining balance of $675 million on the original $1.5 billion of 0.737% senior notes matured and was repaid.
in march 2021, we issued $1,000 million of 2.70% senior notes due march 15, 2031 (the "2031 notes"). the 2031 notes were sold at 99.79% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 2.706%. interest on the 2031 notes is payable semi-annually in arrears and commenced on september 15, 2021. the 2031 notes rank pari passu to our other senior notes, the multi-currency revolving credit facility, the revolving credit note, the overdraft facility, and the money market facility. we used the proceeds from the 2023 notes and 2031 notes to finance a portion of the june 2021 alliance healthcare acquisition.
we have a $2.4 billion multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility ("multi-currency revolving credit facility"), which was scheduled to expire in october 2027, with a syndicate of lenders. in october 2023, we amended and restated the multi-currency revolving credit facility to extend the expiration to october 2028. interest on borrowings under the multi-currency revolving credit facility accrues at specified rates based upon our debt rating and ranges from 80.5 basis points to 122.5 basis points over sofr/euribor/cdor/rfr, as applicable (102.5 basis points over cdor/libor/euribor/bankers acceptance stamping fee as of september 30, 2023) and from 0 basis points to 22.5 basis points over the alternate base rate and canadian prime rate, as applicable. we pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the multi-currency revolving credit facility at specified rates based upon our debt rating, ranging from 7 basis points to 15 basis points, annually, of the total commitment (10 basis points as of september 30, 2023). we may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the multi-currency revolving credit facility at any time. the multi-currency revolving credit facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of subsidiaries and asset sales, with which we were compliant as of september 30, 2023.
we have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $2.4 billion at any one time. amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. the maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. the notes will bear interest, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. the commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our multi-currency revolving credit facility. there were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program as of september 30, 2023 and 2022.
we have a $1,450 million receivables securitization facility ("receivables securitization facility"), which is scheduled to expire in october 2025. we have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the receivables securitization facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the december and march quarters. interest rates are based upon prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or 30-day term sofr plus a program fee. we pay a customary unused fee at prevailing market rates, annually, to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility.
in connection with the receivables securitization facility, amerisourcebergen drug corporation and a specialty distribution subsidiary sell on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation, a wholly-owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to financial institutions and commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. amerisourcebergen drug corporation is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility. as sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources. we securitize our trade accounts, which are generally non-interest bearing, in transactions that are accounted for as borrowings. the receivables securitization facility contains similar covenants to the multi-currency revolving credit facility, with which we were compliant as of september 30, 2023.
we have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note ("revolving credit note"). the revolving credit note provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $75 million. the revolving credit note may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice. we also have a £10 million uncommitted u.k. overdraft facility ("overdraft facility"), which expires in february 2024, to fund short-term normal trading cycle fluctuations related to our mwi animal health business. we have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a money market credit agreement ("money market facility"). the money market facility provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $100 million. the money market facility may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice.
in february 2021, we entered into a $1.0 billion variable-rate term loan ("february 2021 term loan"), which was available to be drawn on the closing date of the acquisition of alliance healthcare. in april 2021, we reduced our commitment under the february 2021 term loan to $500 million. in june 2021, we borrowed $500 million under the february 2021 term loan to finance a portion of the june 2021 alliance healthcare acquisition. we elected to make principal payments of $250 million in september 2021 and again in march 2022 to repay the loan that was scheduled to mature in 2023.
alliance healthcare debt is comprised of uncommitted revolving credit facilities in various currencies with various rates. a vast majority of the outstanding borrowings were held in turkey as of september 30, 2023. these facilities are used to fund its working capital needs.
nonrecourse debt is comprised of short-term and long-term debt belonging to the brazil subsidiaries and is repaid solely from the brazil subsidiaries' cash flows and such debt agreements provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts, and cash flows of the brazil subsidiaries.

commitments and obligations as discussed and defined in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, on july 21, 2021, it was announced that we and the two other national pharmaceutical distributors had negotiated a distributor settlement agreement. the distributor settlement agreement became effective on april 2, 2022, and as of september 30, 2023, it included 48 of 49 eligible states (the "settling states") as well as 99% by population of the eligible political subdivisions in the settling states. our remaining estimated liability related to the distributor settlement agreement, the state of alabama (with whom we have not reached a settlement agreement), and other opioid-related litigation for which we have reached settlement agreements is approximately $5.5 billion on our consolidated balance sheet as of september 30, 2023 and is expected to be paid over the next 15 years. the payment of the aforementioned litigation liability has not and is not expected to have an impact on our ability to pay dividends.
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancellable operating leases, and minimum payments on our other commitments as of september 30, 2023:
payments due by period (in thousands)              debt, including interest payments             operating                other commitments               total leases within 1 year                                                 $824,443                      $218,139                       $123,829              $1,166,411

the 2017 tax act required a one-time transition tax to be recognized on historical foreign earnings and profits. we expect to pay $139.0 million, net of overpayments and tax credits, related to this transition tax, as of september 30, 2023, which is payable in installments over a six-year period that commenced in january 2021. the transition tax commitment is included in "other commitments" in the above table.
our liability for uncertain tax positions was $551.9 million (including interest and penalties) as of september 30, 2023. this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table. our liability for uncertain tax positions as of september 30, 2023 primarily includes an uncertain tax benefit related to the legal accrual for litigation related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications, as disclosed in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
market risk we have exposure to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non-u.s. operations. our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the u.k. pound sterling, the euro, the turkish lira, the brazilian real, and the canadian dollar. we use forward contracts to hedge against the foreign currency exchange rate impact on certain intercompany receivable and payable balances. we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, but not for speculative or trading purposes. revenue from our foreign operations during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 was approximately 10% of our consolidated revenue.
we have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt. we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. the amount of variable-rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements. we had $491.1 million of variable-rate debt outstanding as of september 30, 2023. we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. however, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and/or on terms acceptable to us. there were no such financial instruments in effect as of september 30, 2023.
we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents. we had $2,592.1 million in cash and cash equivalents as of september 30, 2023. the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable-rate debt. for every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable-rate debt, a 10-basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by $0.1 million.
deterioration of general economic conditions, among other factors, could adversely affect the number of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers. in addition, volatility in financial markets and higher borrowing costs may also negatively impact our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth, our profitability, and our cash flow from operations.
recent elevated levels of inflation in the global and u.s. economies have impacted certain operating expenses. if elevated levels of inflation persist or increase, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected, particularly in certain global markets.
we have risks from other geopolitical trends and events, such as the ongoing conflicts in ukraine and between israel and hamas. although the long-term implications of these conflicts are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of these conflicts has not been material.

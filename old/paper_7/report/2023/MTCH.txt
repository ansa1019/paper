management overview match group, inc., through its portfolio companies, is a leading provider of digital technologies designed to help people make meaningful connections. our global portfolio of brands includes tinder®, hinge®, match®, meetic®, okcupid®, pairstm, plenty of fish®, azar®, blk®, and more, each built to increase our users' likelihood of connecting with others. through our trusted brands, we provide tailored services to meet the varying preferences of our users. our services are available in over 40 languages to our users all over the world.
as used herein, "match group," the "company," "we," "our," "us," and similar terms refer to match group, inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
sources of revenue all of our services provide the use of certain features for free as well as a variety of additional features through a subscription or, for certain features, on a pay-per-use, or à la carte, basis. our revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring subscription fees and à la carte purchases.
subscription revenue is presented net of credits and credit card chargebacks. payers who purchase subscriptions or à la carte features pay in advance, primarily by using a credit card or through mobile app stores, and, subject to certain conditions identified in our terms and conditions, all purchases are final and nonrefundable. fees collected, or contractually due, in advance for subscriptions are deferred and recognized as revenue using the straight-line method over the term of the applicable subscription period, which primarily ranges from one week to six months, and corresponding in-app purchase fees incurred on such transactions, if any, are deferred and expensed over the same period. revenue from the purchase of à la carte features is recognized based on usage. we also earn revenue from online advertising, which is recognized every time an ad is displayed.
trends affecting our business each brand in our portfolio has the goal of using technology to help people make meaningful connections. while the goal is the same for each brand, the means to achieve that goal can be differentiated by how a specific brand targets their primary demographic. with users of our apps often utilizing multiple apps, our brands can often have overlap on targeted users. the overall trends affecting all brands within our portfolio, include the following:
increase in acceptance and growth of technologies to meet people globally. over the past decade, there has been meaningful growth in the use of technologies to meet people in north america and western europe, and we see the potential for similar growth in the rest of the world in the years ahead. as more internet-connected people seeking connections utilize technologies to meet people, we believe there remains potential for accelerating growth in the use of these technologies in certain global markets where adoption lags more developed countries. as a result, new services, entrants to the market, and business models are likely to continue to emerge, sometimes at the expense of our existing brands, by harnessing a new technology, such as generative artificial intelligence ("ai") or a new or existing distribution channel, creating a new or different approach to connecting people, or some other means.
in-app purchase fees. purchases made by our customers through mobile applications, as opposed to desktop or mobile web, continue to increase, and are required in most cases to be processed through the in-app payment systems provided by apple and google. where we are required to use apple's or google's payment systems, we pay apple and google, as applicable, a meaningful share (generally 30% or, for subscriptions purchased on android devices, 15%) of the revenue we receive from these transactions. where payments on android devices are processed through other payment systems, we are also required to pay google a meaningful share of our revenue. however we have entered into a partnership with google that will provide value exchange across our broad relationship with them, which we expect to help offset the additional costs that our brands expect to incur over the three years starting in 2024 associated with implementing google's user choice billing system, which allows application developers to offer an additional billing system alongside google play's billing system. additionally, while apple was recently forced to change its rules in the u.s. marketplace on anti-steering to allow for payment processing outside its payment systems, apple has stated that it will still charge up to 27% for those transactions. we do not expect to realize any meaningful decrease in app store fees in the u.s. market as a result of this change. in the eu, the digital markets act is set to go into effect in march 2024. apple has submitted its plan for compliance, which would lower the 30% service fee in the eu to 17% for our applications, but would also add a payment processing fee of 3%, as well as a 0.50 euro fee per download (including updates) per year. apple's plan is subject to approval by eu regulators. for additional information, see "item 1 business-dependencies on services provided by others-app stores."
implementing new technologies that enhance our user experience. we expect new technologies, including those utilizing generative ai, to continue to drive user engagement. as new technologies develop we evaluate whether those technologies can be incorporated into our apps to enhance the user experience. we are planning to further integrate ai technologies into our services, which integrations may become important to our operations over time. the rapid evolution of ai will require the dedication of significant resources to develop, test, and maintain these technologies. we expect other technologies to evolve and be tested in our services and incorporated into our apps in the future.
in addition to the trends affecting our overall portfolio, some of our individual brands are affected by certain other trends, including the following:
tinder. when tinder was first developed, the smart phone provided a unique way of offering connections that traditional desktop-based services did not offer. tinder was able to capitalize on the rise in the use of smart phones and with its younger audience was able to achieve considerable scale through word-of-mouth and viral moments on social media without the need to supplement with significant brand marketing. as the availability of services catering to human connections has increased, we have begun to supplement tinder's viral growth with brand marketing to build out tinder's brand narrative and grow the size of its user base, which has resulted in an increase in selling and marketing expense at tinder. recently, tinder has experienced a decline in user growth, with plans to return to growth with product initiatives that focus on the female experience and younger users.
hinge. hinge has developed a strong user base in english speaking markets and began expanding into european markets in the latter half of 2022. its strong user growth in english speaking and other european markets has helped to contribute to a high level of revenue growth, which we expect will continue into the coming years. as hinge continues to expand its footprint globally, we intend to continue to focus on adding new features to its service to continue to drive user satisfaction for its target audience of intentioned daters, and to drive additional opportunities for monetization. in the near term, we expect to continue to make investments in the business to support this growth, including investments in product development as well as brand marketing.
mg asia. the focus of the mg asia brands has primarily been to serve various asian and middle eastern markets. plans to grow revenue include further expansion by certain brands into the european and u.s. markets. in japan, our pairs brand recently won approval to begin advertising on television. while the results of that advertising are still preliminary, early signs have been encouraging. we expect the advertising to increase pairs' brand recognition while we work to grow users through various product initiatives and by partnering with local government to improve declining marriage rates in the country. our azar app, which provides one to one video chat, has a strong presence in asia and the middle east and is expanding in europe and to the u.s. our hakuna app provides live streaming services primarily in korea and japan.
evergreen & emerging. our collections of brands within e&e include well-known pioneers in online relationships (which we refer to as evergreen brands) and newer bets which target specific demographics (which we refer to as emerging brands). revenues from the evergreen brands have declined in recent years, while emerging brands are in the early stages of growth and in many cases are relying on marketing to increase the size of their user base. in 2023, we began a multi-year process of consolidating technology platforms across various evergreen brands to enable faster feature releases and to reduce the cost to further develop and maintain those platforms.
other trends or factors affecting the comparability of our results advertising spend. our advertising spend, which is included in our selling and marketing expense, has consistently been one of our larger operating expenses. how we deploy our advertising spend varies among brands, with the majority of our advertising spend taking place online, including social media sites, streaming services, search engines, and influencers. additionally, some brands utilize out-of-home marketing campaigns, such as on television and outdoor billboards. for established brands, we seek to optimize for total return on advertising spend by frequently analyzing and adjusting spend to focus on marketing channels and markets that generate returns above our thresholds. our data-driven approach provides us the flexibility to scale and optimize our advertising spend. we spend advertising dollars against an expected lifetime value of a payer that is realized over a multi-year period. while this advertising spend is intended to be profitable on that basis, it is nearly always negative during the period in which the expense is incurred. for newer brands that are gaining scale, or existing brands that are expanding into new geographies, we may make incremental advertising investments to establish the brand before optimizing monetization of the brand. in general, our more established brands spend a higher proportion of their revenue on advertising while our newer brands spend a lower proportion and tend to rely more on word of mouth and other viral marketing. our advertising spend may be incurred unevenly throughout the year.
international markets. our services are available across the world. our international revenue represented 54% and 55% of our total revenue for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we vary our pricing to align with local market conditions and our international businesses typically earn revenue in local currencies. as foreign currency exchange rates change, translation of the statement of operations of our international businesses into u.s. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results.
2023 consolidated results in 2023, total revenue grew 6%, operating income increased 78%, and adjusted operating income grew 11% year-over-year. revenue growth was primarily due to strong growth at tinder and hinge. operating income and adjusted operating income were positively affected by the increase in revenue and decreases in general and administrative expenses primarily related to decreases in legal and other professional fees. those positive effects were partially offset by increases in selling and marketing spend at tinder and hinge and increases in product development expense primarily due to an increase in compensation expense. operating income further benefited from decreases in impairment and amortization expense compared to 2022, during which there was an impairment of certain intangible assets. that benefit was partially offset by increased stock-based compensation expense primarily due to new stock-based awards granted during the year.

operating income increased 78% or $401.9 million, and adjusted operating income increased 11% or $129.8 million. operating income and adjusted operated income each benefited from the increase in revenue of $175.7 million which was driven by growth at tinder and hinge, and lower general and administrative expense primarily related to decreases in legal and other professional fees. that benefit was partially offset by increases in selling and marketing spend and an increase in product development expense primarily due to increased compensation expense. operating income further benefited from decreases in impairments of intangible assets of $316.1 million, partially offset by increased stock-based compensation expense primarily due to new stock-based awards granted during the year.
at december 31, 2023, there was $368.9 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all stock-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.0 years.

for the year ended december 31, 2023, the company recorded an income tax provision from continuing operations of $125.3 million at an effective tax rate of 16%, which is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to (i) a release of a valuation allowance associated with u.s. foreign tax credits that we now expect to utilize, (ii) a lower tax rate on u.s. income derived from foreign sources, and (iii) the generation of federal and state research credits. these benefits were partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible stock-based compensation.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, the company recorded an income tax provision from continuing operations of $15.4 million at an effective tax rate of 4%, which is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to (i) excess tax benefits generated by the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards, (ii) a release of a valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets that we expect to utilize, (iii) favorable outcomes of tax audits and (iv) a lower tax rate on u.s. income derived from foreign sources. the benefits were partially offset by higher state income taxes due to higher taxable income in the u.s.
a number of countries are actively drafting legislation to implement the oecd international tax framework, including the pillar ii minimum tax regime with effect from january 1, 2024 or later. the company is continuing to monitor these developments and any potential impact on its results of operations.
non-gaap financial measures match group reports adjusted operating income and revenue excluding foreign exchange effects, both of which are supplemental measures to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). adjusted operating income is among the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our business, on which our internal budget is based, and by which management is compensated. revenue excluding foreign exchange effects provides a comparable framework for assessing how our business performed without the effect of exchange rate differences when compared to prior periods. we believe that investors should have access to the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. these non-gaap measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results. match group endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-gaap measures presented by providing the comparable gaap measures with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-gaap measures. we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and non-gaap measures, which we discuss below.
adjusted operating income adjusted operating income is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements, as applicable. we believe this measure is useful to analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. the above items are excluded from our adjusted operating income measure because they are non-cash in nature. adjusted operating income has certain limitations because it excludes the impact of certain expenses.
non-cash expenses that are excluded from adjusted operating income stock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants of stock options, restricted stock units ("rsus"), performance-based rsus, and market-based awards. these expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method; however, performance-based rsus and market-based awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market condition(s) have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). to the extent stock-based awards are settled on a net basis, we remit the required tax-withholding amounts from current funds.
depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.
amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions. at the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as customer lists, trade names, and technology, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. value is also assigned to (i) acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of trade names and trademarks, and (ii) goodwill, which are not subject to amortization. an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.

effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on revenue the impact of foreign exchange rates on the company, due to its global reach, may be an important factor in understanding period over period comparisons if movement in exchange rates is significant. since our results are reported in u.s. dollars, international revenue is favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies. we believe the presentation of revenue excluding the effects from foreign exchange, in addition to reported revenue, helps improve investors' ability to understand the company's performance because it excludes the impact of foreign currency volatility that is not indicative of match group's core operating results.
revenue excluding foreign exchange effects compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. revenue excluding foreign exchange effects is calculated by translating current period revenue using prior period exchange rates. the percentage change in revenue excluding foreign exchange effects is calculated by determining the change in current period revenue over prior period revenue where current period revenue is translated using prior period exchange rates.

the company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2023, other than those described above.
in may 2022, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program (the "2022 share repurchase program") to repurchase up to 12.5 million shares of our common stock. on april 28, 2023, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program (the "2023 share repurchase program") for the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion in aggregate value of shares of match group stock, which replaced the 2022 share repurchase program. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we repurchased 13.5 million shares for $546.2 million, on a trade date basis, under the 2022 and 2023 share repurchase programs.
on january 30, 2024, the board of directors of the company approved a new share repurchase program (the "2024 share repurchase program") for the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion in aggregate value of shares of match group stock. the 2024 share repurchase program replaces the 2023 share repurchase program. under the 2024 share repurchase program, shares of our common stock may be purchased on a discretionary basis from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other means, including through rule 10b5-1 trading plans. the 2024 share repurchase program may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time.

our indebtedness could limit our ability to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service, or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to pursue acquisitions or invest in other areas, such as developing properties and exploiting business opportunities. the company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to make additional acquisitions and investments or to provide for greater financial flexibility. additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the company or at all.
critical accounting policies and estimates the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of match group's accounting policies contained in "note 2-summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data" in regard to significant areas of judgment. management of the company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. these estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results could differ from these estimates. because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others. what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
business combinations acquisitions have historically been an important part of our growth strategy. the purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. the fair value of these intangible assets is based on valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. the excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.
recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill is the company's largest asset with a carrying value of $2.3 billion at each of december 31, 2023 and 2022, representing 52% and 56%, respectively, of the company's total assets. indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of certain of the company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $183.1 million and $189.0 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
in performing its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the company has the option under gaap to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value; if the conclusion of the qualitative assessment is that there are no indicators of impairment, the company does not perform a quantitative test, which would require a valuation of the reporting unit, as of october 1. if needed, the annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded. the 2023 and 2022 annual assessments did not identify any goodwill impairments.
the company has a negative carrying value for the company's annual goodwill test at both october 1, 2023 and 2022. additionally, an impairment test of goodwill was not necessary because there were no factors identified that would indicate an impairment loss. the company continued to have a negative carrying value at december 31, 2023.
the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying values. for certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, for which the fair value as of the most recent assessment date significantly exceeded the carrying value, the company performed a qualitative impairment assessment as of october 1, 2023 and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of those indefinite-lived intangible assets continued to exceed the carrying values. for assets in which a quantitative assessment is performed, the company determines the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty discounted cash flow ("dcf") valuation analysis. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the specific trade names and trademarks. the future cash flows are based on the company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the company's estimates are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed at least annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. the discount rates used in the company's quantitative assessments as part of the annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 15% to 18% in 2023 and 12% to 16% in 2022, and the royalty rates used ranged from 3% to 8% in both 2023 and 2022.
if the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment equal to the excess is recorded. during the year ended december 31, 2022, the company recognized impairment charges of $244.3 million related to the azar and hakuna brands at hyperconnect, $43.9 million related to the meetic and match brands in europe, and $5.5 million related to certain affinity brands in the u.s. these impairments were primarily due to a decline in projections related to a lower outlook for the businesses at that time, including foreign currency impacts in certain of hyperconnect's key markets, as well as the use of increased discount rates as a result of an increase in risk-free rates and overall market volatility in general.
at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, the aggregate indefinite-lived intangible asset balance for which the estimate of fair value at that time was less than 110% of their carrying values was approximately $76.5 million and $84.3 million, respectively.
in connection with the annual impairment assessment, the company reviews the useful lives for intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that an indefinite life may no longer be appropriate. as of october 1, 2022, the company reclassified certain indefinite-lived intangible assets with a carrying value of $49.9 million to the definite-lived intangible asset category because these assets were no longer considered to have an indefinite life.
recoverability and estimated useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets we review the carrying value of all definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. the carrying value of a definite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the definite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. in addition, the company reviews the useful lives of its definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed. during the year ended december 31, 2022, the company recognized an impairment charge related to hyperconnect intangible assets with definitive lives of $25.8 million, which is included within impairment and amortization of intangibles. the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets was $122.7 million and $168.7 million, at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
income taxes match group is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.
we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of asset and liabilities, as well as for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. we recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of enactment.
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.
we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. such tax benefits are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustment. we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, the final outcome of these matters may vary significantly from our estimates. to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.
stock-based compensation the company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $232.1 million and $203.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
accounting for stock-based compensation at the company is often complex due to our desire to attract, retain, and reward employees at many of our brands by allowing them to benefit from the value they help to create. we also utilize stock-based awards as part of our acquisition strategy. we accomplish these objectives, in part, by issuing awards denominated in the equity of our non-public subsidiaries as well as in match group, inc. we further refine this approach by tailoring the terms of awards as appropriate. for example, we issue certain awards with vesting conditioned on the achievement of specified performance targets such as revenue or profits; these awards are referred to as performance awards. in other cases, we condition the vesting of awards to the achievement of value targets for a specific subsidiary or the company's stock price; these awards are referred to as market-based awards.
the company issues rsus and performance-based rsus ("psus"). the value of rsus with vesting subject only to continued service is based on the fair value of match group common stock on the grant date. the value of rsus that include a market condition is based on fair value estimated using a lattice model. the value of rsus is expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the applicable vesting term. for psu awards, the expense is measured at the grant date as the fair value of match group common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term if the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.

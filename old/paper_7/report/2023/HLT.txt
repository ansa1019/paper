item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
for the discussion of the financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, refer to "part ii-item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022 filed with the sec on february 9, 2023, which is incorporated herein by reference.
covid-19 pandemic although our results for the year ended december 31, 2022 included a strong recovery from the pandemic when compared to the same periods in 2020 and 2021, the omicron variant of covid-19 limited the recovery of certain regions and segments of our business during the beginning of that period. as such, the results for the year ended december 31, 2023 reflect improvement in comparison to the year ended december 31, 2022, when considering the pandemic. while certain regions and customer segments, particularly business and group travel, continue to recover from the impacts of the pandemic, our global growth when comparing 2023 to 2022 is more normalized than it was during the height of the pandemic and our subsequent recovery. additionally, given the impacts of the pandemic on prior periods, the improvement in our results during the year ended december 31, 2023 is not necessarily indicative of future performance or future growth patterns.
overview our business hilton is one of the largest hospitality companies in the world, with 7,530 properties comprising 1,182,937 rooms in 126 countries and territories as of december 31, 2023. our premier brand portfolio includes luxury, lifestyle, full service, focused service and all-suites hotel brands, as well as our timeshare brands. as of december 31, 2023, we had 180 million members in our award-winning guest loyalty program, hilton honors, a 19 percent increase from december 31, 2022.
segments and regions we analyze our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions. our operations consist of two reportable segments that are based on similar products and services: (i) management and franchise and (ii) ownership. the management and franchise segment provides services, including hotel management and licensing of our ip. revenues from this segment include: (i) management and franchise fees charged to third-party hotel owners; (ii) licensing fees from our strategic partners, including co-branded credit card providers, and hgv; and (iii) fees for managing hotels in our ownership segment. as a manager of hotels, we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the hotel in exchange for management fees. as a franchisor of hotels, we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services, such as our reservations system, marketing and information technology services, while a third party manages or operates such franchised hotels. the ownership segment primarily derives revenues from nightly hotel room sales, food and beverage sales and other services at our consolidated owned and leased hotels.
we conduct business in three distinct geographic regions: (i) the americas; (ii) emea; and (iii) asia pacific. the americas region includes north america, south america and central america, including all caribbean nations. although the u.s., which represented 67 percent of our system-wide hotel rooms as of december 31, 2023, is included in the americas region, it is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas region and, as such, it is presented separately within our hotel operating statistics in "-results of operations." the emea region includes europe, which represents the western-most peninsula of eurasia stretching from iceland in the west to russia in the east, and the middle east and africa ("mea"), which represents the middle east region and all african nations, including the indian ocean island nations. europe and mea are often analyzed separately and, as such, are presented separately within our hotel operating statistics in "-results of operations." the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia, as well as india, australia, new zealand and the pacific island nations.
system growth and development pipeline our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global hotel network, in particular our fee-based business. as we enter into new management and franchise contracts, we expand our business with limited or no capital investment by us as the manager or franchisor, since the capital required to build, renovate and maintain hotels is typically provided by the third-party owners with whom we contract to provide management services or license our ip. prior to approving the addition of new hotels to our management and franchise development pipeline, we evaluate the economic viability of the hotel based on its geographic location, the credit quality of the third-party owner and other factors. by increasing the number of management and franchise contracts with third-party owners, over time we expect to increase revenues, overall return on invested capital and cash available to support our business needs. see further discussion on our cash management policy in "-liquidity and capital resources." the current economic environment, including elevated levels of inflation and interest rates, has posed certain challenges to the execution of our growth strategy, which have included and may continue to include delays in openings and new development.
in addition to our current hotel portfolio, we are focused on the growth of our business by expanding our global hotel network through our development pipeline, which represents hotels that we expect to add to our system in the future. the following table summarizes our development activity:

(4)of the total rooms in our development pipeline, 216,600 were under construction and 259,800 were located outside of the u.s. nearly all of the rooms in our development pipeline will be in our management and franchise segment upon opening. we do not consider any individual development project to be material to us.
principal components and factors affecting our results of operations revenues principal components we primarily derive our revenues from the following sources:
•franchise and licensing fees. represents fees earned in connection with licensing our ip, including our brands. under our long-term franchise contracts with hotel owners, franchisees typically pay us franchise fees that include: (i) monthly royalty fees, generally based on a percentage of the hotel's monthly gross room revenue, and, in some cases, may also include a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues, as applicable; and (ii) application, initiation and other fees for when new hotels enter the system, when there is a change of ownership of a hotel or when contracts with hotels already in our system are extended. consideration provided to incentivize hotel owners to enter into franchise contracts with us is amortized over the life of the applicable contract as a reduction to franchise and licensing fees. our non-hotel license agreements, for which we receive licensing fees, are predominantly with strategic partners, including co-branded credit card providers, and hgv.
•base and incentive management fees. represents fees earned in connection with the management of hotels. terms of our management contracts vary, but our fees typically consist of a base management fee, which is generally based on a percentage of the hotel's monthly gross operating revenue and, when applicable, an incentive management fee, which is generally based on a percentage of the hotel's operating profits, normally over a one calendar year period, and, in some cases, may be subject to a stated return threshold to the hotel owner. outside of the u.s., our fees are often more dependent on hotel profitability measures, either because of a single management fee structure where the entire fee is an incentive management fee, or because our two-tier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive management fee than the base management fee. consideration provided to incentivize hotel owners to enter into management contracts with us is amortized over the life of the applicable contract as a reduction to base and other management fees.
•owned and leased hotels. represents revenues derived from the operations of our consolidated owned and leased hotels, including hotel room sales, accommodations sold in conjunction with other services, food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services. these revenues are primarily derived from two categories of customers: transient and group. transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure. group guests are travelers who are traveling for group events that reserve rooms for meetings, conferences or social functions, and may be sponsored by corporate, social, military, educational, religious or other organizations or associations. group business usually includes a block of room accommodations, as well as other ancillary services, such as meeting facilities and catering and banquet services. a majority of our food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services are provided to customers who are also occupying rooms at our hotels. as a result, occupancy affects all components of our owned and leased hotels revenues.
•other revenues. represents revenues primarily generated by our purchasing operations.
•other revenues from managed and franchised properties. represents amounts that are contractually reimbursed to us by property owners, either directly as costs are incurred or indirectly through monthly program fees related to certain costs and expenses supporting the operations of the related properties. the direct reimbursements by hotel owners are primarily for payroll and related costs if the managed hotel employees are legally employed by us. we have no legal responsibility for the employee liabilities related to certain of our managed properties, predominately those located outside of the u.s., where we are not the legal employer, as well as the employees or the liabilities associated with operating franchised properties. revenues and expenses for these direct reimbursements have no net effect on operating income (loss) or net income (loss). for the indirect reimbursements, hilton collects monthly program fees from our managed and franchised properties, which are based on the underlying hotel's sales or usage. the program fees serve as reimbursement for the costs related to the operation of our marketing, sales and brand programs and shared services. other revenues from managed and franchised properties also includes revenues related to our hilton honors guest loyalty program, which are primarily derived from payments from hotel franchisees and third-party owners of hotels we manage that participate in the program, as well as strategic partners. we are contractually required to use these fees that we collect solely for these programs.
factors affecting our revenues the following factors affect the revenues we derive from our operations:
•consumer demand and global economic conditions. consumer demand for our products and services, as well as the products and services of the third parties from which we earn licensing fees, is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. among other factors, declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions, risks reducing or otherwise negatively affecting travel patterns, lower consumer confidence and adverse geopolitical conditions can reduce the amount of management and franchise fees we are able to generate and/or reduce the revenues and profitability of the operations of our owned and leased hotels. further, competition for hotel guests and the supply of hotel services affect our ability to sustain or increase rates charged to customers of our hotels. also, declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly affect the incentive portion of our management fees, which is based on hotel profitability measures. as a result, changes in consumer demand and general business cycles have historically subjected and could in the future subject our revenues to significant volatility.
•contracts with third-party hotel owners and franchisees and relationships with developers. we depend on our long-term management and franchise contracts with third-party hotel owners and hotel franchisees for our management and franchise fee revenues. the success and sustainability of our management and franchise business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchise contracts and maintain good relationships with third-party hotel owners and franchisees. our relationships with these third parties allow us to maintain our current presence as contracts mature and also generate new incremental opportunities for property development that can support our growth. growth and maintenance of our hotel system and earning fees related to hotels in development are dependent on the ability of developers and owners to access capital for the development, maintenance and renovation of properties. we believe that we generally have good relationships with our third-party hotel owners, franchisees and developers and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships. these relationships exist with a diverse group of owners, franchisees and developers and are not significantly concentrated with any one particular third party.
expenses principal components we primarily incur the following expenses:
•owned and leased hotels. reflects the operating expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels, including room expenses, food and beverage costs, other support costs and property expenses. room expenses include compensation costs for housekeeping, laundry and front desk staff, as well as supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry. food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage inventory. other support expenses include costs associated with property-level management, utilities, sales and marketing, operating hotel spas, operating telephones, parking and other guest recreation, entertainment and other services. property expenses include property taxes, repairs and maintenance, rent and insurance.
•depreciation and amortization. these are non-cash expenses that primarily consist of: (i) amortization of capitalized software costs; (ii) depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, including our finance lease right-of-use ("rou") assets, such as buildings and furniture and equipment that are used in corporate operations or at our consolidated owned and leased hotels; and (iii) amortization of intangible assets that were recorded at their fair value at the time of the 2007 transaction whereby we became a wholly owned subsidiary of affiliates of blackstone inc. (the "merger"). as of january 1, 2021 the only remaining finite-lived intangible assets resulting from the merger related to leases, international management contracts and our hilton honors guest loyalty program. the assets related to the international management contracts and hilton honors, which both had useful lives of 16 years, were fully amortized during the year ended december 31, 2023.
•general and administrative. consists primarily of compensation costs for our corporate employees, including share-based compensation; professional fees, including consulting, audit and legal fees; travel and entertainment expenses; credit losses for estimated uncollectible management, franchise and other fees; and administrative and related expenses.
•other expenses. primarily consists of expenses incurred by our purchasing operations.
•other expenses from managed and franchised properties. represents certain costs and expenses that are contractually reimbursed to us by property owners, primarily for (i) payroll and related costs for hotels that we manage where the employees are legally employed by us and (ii) expenses related to our marketing, sales, brands and shared services programs. we are contractually required to use these fees solely for these programs. we have no legal responsibility for the employees or the liabilities associated with operating franchised properties or certain of our managed hotels, predominately those located outside of the u.s. other expenses from managed and franchised properties also includes expenses for the operation of our hilton honors guest loyalty program.
factors affecting our costs and expenses the following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations:
•fixed expenses. many of the expenses associated with owning and leasing hotels are relatively fixed. these expenses include personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities. if we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels decreases, the resulting decline in our revenues can have an adverse effect on our net cash flows and profits. this effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. economic downturns generally affect the results of our ownership segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchise segment due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased hotel. employees at some of our owned and leased hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues. in addition, any efforts to reduce costs, including the deferral or cancellation of capital improvements, could adversely affect the economic value of our hotels and brands. additionally, the general and administrative expenses of operating a global business also include fixed personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities. the effectiveness of any cost-cutting efforts related to owning and leasing hotels or corporate operations is limited by the amount of inherent fixed costs. however, we have taken steps to manage our fixed costs to levels we believe are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to market conditions, while continuing to optimize value for the experiences of our customers, owners and hilton employees, which supports the long-term sustainability of our brands and business.
•changes in depreciation and amortization expenses. we capitalize costs associated with certain software development projects and, as those projects are completed and placed into service, amortization expense will increase. as the finite-lived intangible assets that were recorded at the merger become fully amortized, amortization expense will decrease. as of december 31, 2023, the only remaining finite-lived intangible assets that resulted from the merger were those related to leases, as included in other intangible assets. additionally, changes in depreciation expense may be driven by renovations of existing hotels, acquisition or development of new hotels, the disposition of existing hotels or corporate facilities through sale, closure or lease termination, lease renewals, expenditures related to our corporate facilities or changes in estimates of the useful lives of our assets. as we place new assets into service, we will be required to recognize additional depreciation expense on those assets. if we are required to recognize impairment losses related to our depreciable assets or finite-lived intangible assets, the related depreciation or amortization expense, respectively, will decrease.
other items effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations significant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency, which is usd, and we have assets and liabilities, including those that are payable or receivable by consolidated subsidiaries, denominated in a variety of foreign currencies. as a result, we are required to translate the results of those operations, assets and liabilities from their functional currency into usd at market-based foreign currency exchange rates for each reporting period. when comparing our results of operations between reporting periods, there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates experienced between those periods. we hedge foreign currency exchange-based cash flow variability of certain of our fees using forward contracts designated as hedging instruments. we also hold short-term forward contracts to offset exposure to fluctuations in certain of our foreign currency denominated cash balances and intercompany financing arrangements, and we have not currently elected to designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments.
seasonality the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. the periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property, depending principally upon their location, type of property and competitive mix within the specific location. based on historical results, we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters.
key business and financial metrics used by management comparable hotels we define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period, and open january 1st of the previous year; (ii) have not undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods reported; and (iii) have not undergone large-scale capital projects, sustained substantial property damage, encountered business interruption or for which comparable results were not available. of the 7,438 hotels in our system as of december 31, 2023, 5,906 hotels were classified as comparable hotels. our 1,532 non-comparable hotels as of december 31, 2023 included 359 hotels, or less than five percent of the total hotels in our system, that were removed from the comparable group during the last twelve months because they underwent large-scale capital projects, sustained substantial property damage, encountered business interruption or comparable results were otherwise not available.
occupancy occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels for a given period. occupancy measures the utilization of available capacity at a hotel or group of hotels. management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. occupancy levels also help management determine achievable average daily rate ("adr") pricing levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases.
adr adr represents hotel room revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for a given period. adr measures the average room price attained by a hotel, and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry, and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer, as changes in rates charged to customers have different effects on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above.
revenue per available room ("revpar")
revpar is calculated by dividing hotel room revenue by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period. we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels, as previously described: occupancy and adr. revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels.
references to occupancy, adr and revpar are presented on a comparable basis, based on the comparable hotels as of december 31, 2023, and references to adr and revpar are presented on a currency neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. as such, comparisons of these hotel operating statistics for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 use the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of the company's foreign operations within its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2023.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda reflects net income (loss), excluding interest expense, a provision for income tax benefit (expense) and depreciation and amortization expenses. adjusted ebitda is calculated as ebitda, as previously defined, further adjusted to exclude certain items, including gains, losses, revenues and expenses in connection with: (i) asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated investments; (ii) foreign currency transactions; (iii) debt restructurings and retirements; (iv) furniture, fixtures and equipment ("ff&e") replacement reserves required under certain lease agreements; (v) share-based compensation; (vi) reorganization, severance, relocation and other expenses; (vii) non-cash impairment; (viii) amortization of contract acquisition costs; (ix) the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and expenses included in other revenues and other expenses from managed and franchised properties; and (x) other items.
we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions and (ii) these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry. additionally, these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry. for instance, interest expense and income taxes are dependent on company specifics, including, among other things, capital structure and operating jurisdictions, respectively, and, therefore, could vary significantly across companies. depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as amortization of contract acquisition costs, are dependent upon company policies, including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are assigned to those depreciating or amortizing assets for accounting purposes. for adjusted ebitda, we also exclude items such as: (i) ff&e replacement reserves for leased hotels to be consistent with the treatment of capital expenditures for property and equipment, where depreciation of such capitalized assets is reported within depreciation and amortization expenses; (ii) share-based compensation, as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them; and (iii) other items that are not reflective of our operating performance, such as amounts related to debt restructurings and debt retirements and reorganization and related severance costs, to enhance period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing operations. further, adjusted ebitda excludes the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and expenses, as we contractually do not operate the related programs to generate a profit over the terms of the respective contracts. the direct reimbursements from hotel owners are typically reimbursed as the costs are incurred and have no net effect on net income (loss). the fees we recognize related to the indirect reimbursements may be recognized before or after the related expenses are incurred, causing timing differences between the costs incurred and the related reimbursement from hotel owners, with the net effect impacting net income (loss) in the reporting period. however, the expenses incurred related to the indirect reimbursements are expected to equal the revenues earned from the indirect reimbursements over time, and, therefore, the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and expenses is not used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance or make day-to-day operating decisions.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and should not be considered as alternatives, either in isolation or as a substitute, for net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity, including cash flows, derived in accordance with gaap. further, ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools, including:
•ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
•ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness;
•ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;
•ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations;
•although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and
•other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
because of these limitations, ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business, return to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.

all regions showed improvement in revpar during the year ended december 31, 2023 driven by both adr, including the impact of inflation, and occupancy gains. additionally, our group business showed the highest percentage improvement in revpar during the year of all of our customer segments, with revpar from both business and leisure travelers also improving. the growth in adr and occupancy in the u.s. and americas (excluding u.s.) during the period was led by returning group and business travelers; however, as travel patterns continued to normalize from the impacts of the pandemic, the growth year over year was less pronounced than prior year improvements. additionally, canada removed all covid-19 travel restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2022, which contributed to the increase in revpar for 2023. europe was led by group business and benefited from inbound travel, and our hotels in the united kingdom drove the increase in revpar from business and leisure travel. the revpar improvement in mea was driven by increased adr across all customer segments, particularly from group business in the first half of the year and steady business and leisure improvements throughout the year. apac led year-over-year revpar improvement on a regional basis, primarily due to business travelers and the removal of cross-border travel and covid-19 restrictions since the latter half of 2022, particularly in japan and china.

(1)amount includes losses recognized related to equity and debt financing that we had previously provided to an unconsolidated affiliate with underlying investments in certain hotels that we currently manage or franchise; refer to note 5: loss on investments in unconsolidated affiliate in our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
(2)amount for the year ended december 31, 2022 was less than $1 million. amounts for both periods include net losses (gains) related to certain of hilton's investments in unconsolidated affiliates, other than the loss included separately in "loss on investments in unconsolidated affiliate," net losses (gains) on asset dispositions, severance and other items. amount for the year ended december 31, 2023 also includes expenses recognized in connection with the amendment of our senior secured term loan facilities (the "term loans").

total management fees                       $616                            $490                               25.7
the increases in franchise fees and management fees were primarily the result of increases in revpar at our comparable franchised and managed hotels, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2023, revpar at our comparable franchised and managed hotels increased 9.1 percent and 23.2 percent, respectively, due to increased occupancy of 3.1 percentage points and 9.6 percentage points, respectively, and increased adr of 4.4 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively, which included increases due to inflation.
further, as new hotels enter our system, we expect such hotels to increase our franchise and management fees. including new development and ownership type transfers, from january 1, 2022 to december 31, 2023, we added 664 franchised and managed properties on a net basis, providing an additional 102,100 rooms to our management and franchise segment, which also contributed to the increases in franchise and management fees.
additionally, licensing fees increased as a result of increases in fees from our strategic partnerships and hgv. increased fees from our strategic partnerships primarily resulted from new cardholder acquisitions and increased cardholder spend under our co-branded credit card arrangements. increased fees from hgv resulted from increased timeshare revenues, inclusive of the impact of adding new timeshare properties to our system during the period, including those acquired by hgv from third-party companies.
incentive management fees increased as they are based on hotels' operating profits, which generally improved from the prior year as increased consumer demand drove higher revenues, elevated margins and, ultimately, higher managed hotel profits.

owned and leased hotels revenues       $1,244                          $1,076           15.6
the $168 million increase in owned and leased hotel revenues included a $165 million currency neutral increase and a $3 million increase resulting from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
revenues from our comparable owned and leased hotels increased $206 million, on a currency neutral basis, due to the increase in revpar at our comparable owned and leased hotels of 36.1 percent, which is reflective of the ongoing easing of travel restrictions in the latter half of 2022, which carried improved performance into 2023, particularly in japan, as well as improved performance in the u.k. the increase in revpar was due to increases in occupancy of 11.9 percentage points and adr of 13.9 percent, which included an increase due to inflation. the $41 million currency neutral decrease in revenues from our non-comparable owned and leased hotels included decreases from properties that exited our system after december 31, 2021, as well as the impact of properties undergoing renovations during the period and the business interruption that occurred at our leased hotel in israel due to the ongoing military conflict.

other revenues       $178                          $102           74.5
the increase in other revenues was primarily due to increased vendor rebates for purchases made directly by managed and franchised properties and other third parties and other revenues from our purchasing operations, including increased procurement volume from properties outside of our system that participate in our purchasing programs.

owned and leased hotels expenses       $1,141                          $999           14.2
the $142 million increase in owned and leased hotels expenses included a $143 million increase on a currency neutral basis, which was partially offset by a $1 million decrease resulting from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
expenses from our comparable owned and leased hotels increased $137 million, on a currency neutral basis, as a result of increased occupancy and cost inflation both driving higher labor costs, utilities and other operating expenses, as well as an increase in rent expense. the net increase in owned and leased hotels expenses from our non-comparable owned and leased hotels included increased expenses for ff&e replacement reserves related to hotels undergoing renovations and decreases from properties that exited our system after december 31, 2021, as well as from the business interruption that occurred at our leased hotel in israel.

____________
(1)fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful.
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses was primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense, driven by the full amortization of: (i) certain intangible assets in 2023 that were recorded at the time of the merger and (ii) certain software project costs during 2023 and 2022. the decrease in amortization expense was partially offset by an increase related to software additions between the periods.
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in costs related to payroll and other compensation costs.
we recognized $38 million of impairment losses during the year ended december 31, 2023 on assets associated with certain leased hotels; see note 11: fair value measurements in our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the increase in other expenses was primarily due to costs associated with higher procurement volume from our purchasing operations, including for properties outside of our system that participate in our purchasing programs.

in november 2023, we amended the credit agreement governing our term loans, which resulted in an increase to the weighted average fixed spread on the overall variable rate on the term loans, and increased the outstanding balance by $500 million, both of which contributed to the increase in interest expense. the increase in interest expense also resulted from an increase in one-month sofr, the benchmark for the term loans' interest rate, as well as an increase in variable rent for our finance leases, which is generally based on a percentage of hotel revenues or profits, which increased as discussed in "-revenues." these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to the net effect of the amortization of gains (losses) from accumulated other comprehensive loss related to interest rate swaps that we used to mitigate floating interest rate risk, including swaps that were dedesignated in prior periods. see note 9: "debt" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the interest rates on our indebtedness, which includes discussion of the term loans amendment.
the net gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including on certain intercompany financing arrangements, such as short-term cross-currency intercompany loans, as well as transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
the loss on investments in unconsolidated affiliate included: (i) a $44 million other-than-temporary impairment loss on our investment in one of our third-party unconsolidated affiliates (the "fund"), which has underlying investments in certain hotels that we currently manage or franchise, and (ii) $48 million of credit losses on financing receivables provided to the fund. see note 5: "loss on investments in unconsolidated affiliate" and note 11: "fair value measurements" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other non-operating income, net consists of interest income, equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates, certain components of net periodic pension cost or credit related to our employee defined benefit pension plans and other non-operating gains and losses. the decrease in other non-operating income, net included the impact of an increase in the interest cost component of our net periodic pension cost, offset by an increase in our interest income, both resulting from increases in interest rates. additionally, the year ended december 31, 2023 included $10 million of fees incurred in connection with the term loans amendment, while the year ended december 31, 2022 included an $11 million gain resulting from the remeasurement of certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates; the loss related to our investment in the fund is presented separately in "loss on investments in unconsolidated affiliate" in our consolidated statement of operations, as discussed above.
the increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to increases in uncertain tax position reserves related to our guest loyalty program.
segment results as of december 31, 2023, our management and franchise segment included 800 managed and 6,679 franchised properties, respectively, consisting of 1,165,446 total rooms, and our ownership segment included 51 hotels consisting of 17,491 total rooms. refer to note 18: "business segments" in our consolidated financial statements for reconciliations of revenues for our reportable segments to consolidated total revenues and of segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, refer to "-revenues" for further discussion of the increase in our franchise and licensing fees and total management fees, which are correlated to our management and franchise segment revenues and segment operating income, as well as for further discussion of the increase in revenues from our owned and leased hotels, which are correlated to our ownership segment revenues. in addition, refer to "-operating expenses" for further discussion of the increase in operating expenses at our owned and leased hotels, which, when netted with our ownership segment revenues and management fees charged by our management and franchise segment, results in our ownership segment operating income (loss).
liquidity and capital resources overview as of december 31, 2023, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $875 million, including $75 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. the majority of our restricted cash and cash equivalents is related to cash collateral and cash held for ff&e reserves.
our known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures, including:
•costs associated with the management and franchising of hotels;
•corporate expenses;
•payroll and compensation costs;
•taxes and compliance costs;
•scheduled debt maturities and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, which, excluding finance lease liabilities, are estimated to be approximately $502 million in 2024;
•lease payments under our finance and operating leases, which include minimum lease payments that are estimated to be approximately $41 million and $153 million, respectively, in 2024;
•costs, other than compensation and lease payments that are noted separately, associated with the operations of owned and leased hotels, including, but not limited to, utilities and operating supplies;
•committed contract acquisition costs;
•capital and maintenance expenditures for required renovations and maintenance at the hotels within our ownership segment;
•dividends as declared; and
•share repurchases.
our known long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for:
•scheduled debt maturities and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, which, excluding finance lease liabilities, are estimated to total an aggregate of $11.5 billion after december 31, 2024;
•lease payments under our finance and operating leases, which include minimum lease payments that are estimated to total an aggregate of $123 million and $1,022 million, respectively, after december 31, 2024;
•committed contract acquisition costs;
•capital improvements to the hotels within our ownership segment;
•corporate capital and information technology expenditures;
•dividends as declared;
•share repurchases; and
•commitments to owners in our management and franchise segment made in the normal course of business for which we are reimbursed by these owners through program fees to operate our marketing, sales and brand programs and shared services.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately 15.6 million shares of our common stock for $2.3 billion. as of december 31, 2023, approximately $3.8 billion remained available for share repurchases under our stock repurchase program.
in circumstances where we have the opportunity to support our strategic objectives, we may provide guarantees or other commitments, as necessary, to owners of hotels that we currently or in the future will manage or franchise or other third parties. see note 19: "commitments and contingencies" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our commitments that were outstanding as of december 31, 2023.
we have a long-term investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments and returning available capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. within the framework of our investment policy, we intend to finance our business activities primarily with cash on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2023, cash generated from our operations and, as needed, the use of the available capacity of our senior secured revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility"). additionally, we have continued access to debt markets and expect to be able to obtain financing as a source of liquidity as required and to extend maturities of existing borrowings, if necessary.
after considering our approach to liquidity and our available sources of cash, we believe that our cash position and sources of liquidity will meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures, including corporate expenses, payroll and other compensation costs, taxes and compliance costs and other commitments for the foreseeable future based on current conditions. the objectives of our cash management policy are maintaining the availability of liquidity and minimizing operational costs.
we may from time to time issue or incur or increase our capacity to incur new debt and/or purchase our outstanding debt through underwritten offerings, open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. issuances or incurrence of new debt (or an increase in our capacity to incur new debt) and/or purchases or retirements of outstanding debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. the amounts involved may be material.

____________
(1)fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful; see additional details below.
operating activities cash flows from operating activities were primarily generated from management and franchise fee revenue and operating income from our owned and leased hotels. the increase during the period was primarily due to the increase in cash inflows generated from our management and franchise segment, largely as a result of the 12.1 percent increase in revpar at our comparable managed and franchised properties. the increase in cash inflows generated by operating activities was partially offset by a $152 million increase in payments of contract acquisition costs due to the timing of certain strategic hotel developments supporting our growth, as well as an $89 million increase in the net cash outflows related to income tax payments.
in april 2020, we pre-sold hilton honors points to american express and, in the second quarter of 2022, all of those points had been used by american express. as such, american express resumed purchasing hilton honors points with cash in connection with a co-branded credit card arrangement with them, which contributed to the increase in our operating cash flows during the year ended december 31, 2023. we expect american express to continue to purchase points with cash under the co-branded credit card arrangement in future periods.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities primarily included cash flows related to: (i) capitalized software costs that were related to various systems initiatives for the benefit of both our hotel owners and our overall corporate operations; (ii) capital expenditures for property and equipment related to corporate property and the renovation of certain hotels in our ownership segment, which increased between the periods due to the timing of certain corporate and hotel capital expenditure projects; and (iii) equity and debt financing that we provided to unconsolidated affiliates and owners of hotels that we manage or franchise to support our strategic objectives. additionally, our investing activities include the net cash inflows and outflows related to our undesignated derivative financial instruments that we have in place to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on certain of our intercompany loan and cash balances, which were primarily the result of changes in the exchange rates for the pound sterling ("gbp") to the u.s. dollar.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities during both the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 primarily related to the return of capital to stockholders, including dividends, which resumed in the second quarter of 2022, as well as share repurchases, which resumed in march 2022, after both programs were suspended in 2020. the increase in net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by the increase in net cash inflows related to additional borrowings on the term loans of $500 million, as well as those related to settlements of our interest rate swap with a financing component for which we receive a variable rate and pay a fixed rate, due to the increase in the variable interest rate.
debt and borrowing capacity as of december 31, 2023, our total indebtedness, excluding the deduction for unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts, was approximately $9.3 billion. no debt amounts were outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2023, which had an available borrowing capacity of $1,913 million after considering $87 million of outstanding letters of credit. for additional information on our total indebtedness and guarantees on our debt, refer to note 9: "debt" in our consolidated financial statements.
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to reduce capital expenditures or issue additional equity securities. however, we do not have any material indebtedness outstanding that matures prior to may 2025. our ability to make scheduled principal payments and to pay interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance, which is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hospitality industry that may be beyond our control.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe reflect the current circumstances. while we believe our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when they are made. actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments, assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise, which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
we believe that the following estimates, which are used in conjunction with our significant accounting policies, are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and are based on information that is inherently uncertain; refer to note 2: "basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" in our consolidated financial statements for information on our significant accounting policies. management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors:
impairment of goodwill and brands intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and brands intangible assets for potential impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if indicators of impairment exist. our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 18: "business segments" in our consolidated financial statements.
as part of the evaluation of goodwill and brands intangible assets for potential impairment, we exercise judgment to:
•perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand intangible asset is less than its carrying value. factors we consider when making this determination include assessing historical trends and the overall effect of current trends in and future expectations of the hospitality industry and the general economy and regional performance;
•decide whether to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment. factors we consider when making this determination include negative changes in the company or general economic conditions since the previous quantitative assessment was performed, the amount by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value at the time of the previous assessment and the period of time that has passed since such quantitative assessment; and
•perform a quantitative analysis to identify both the existence and the amount of an impairment loss. the estimated fair value is based on internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans, as well as market conditions relative to the operations of the reporting unit or brand, as applicable.
changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment analysis, or changes in the factors that we consider that would affect these estimates and assumptions, such as those described above, could result in impairment losses, which could be material.
impairment of certain finite-lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of our specifically identifiable lease intangible assets, operating and finance lease rou assets and property and equipment for indicators of impairment. as part of the process, we exercise judgment to:
•determine if there are indicators of impairment present. factors we consider when making this determination include assessing historical trends and the overall effect of current trends in and future expectations of the hospitality industry and the general economy and regional performance, capital costs and other asset-specific information;
•determine the projected undiscounted future cash flows when indicators of impairment are present to determine whether an asset group is recoverable by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net carrying value of that asset group. judgment is required when developing projections of future revenues and expenses to determine the undiscounted cash flows, which are based on estimated performance over the expected useful life of the asset group. forward-looking estimates of performance are based on historical operating results, adjusted for current and expected future market conditions, as well as various internal projections and external sources; and
•determine the asset group fair value when an asset group is determined not to be recoverable. in determining the fair value, we often use internally-developed discounted cash flow models, appraisals, recent similar transactions in the market and, if appropriate and available for a specific asset group, current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. the discounted cash flow models include the undiscounted cash flows, as discussed above, which may require us to adjust for specific market conditions, and a discount rate to determine the present value of those cash flows. the discount rate applied to forward-looking projections takes into account market-specific considerations.
changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment analysis, or changes in the factors that we consider that would affect these estimates and assumptions, such as those described above, could result in impairment losses, which could be material.
hilton honors we record a point redemption liability for amounts received from properties participating in our hilton honors guest loyalty program and from strategic partners affiliated with the loyalty program, in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation. we engage third-party actuaries annually to assist in determining the fair value of the future reward redemption obligation using a discount rate and statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment, including: (i) an estimate of the number of points that will eventually be redeemed, which includes an estimate of breakage (i.e., points that will never be redeemed); (ii) an estimate of when such points will be redeemed; and (iii) an estimate of the cost of reimbursing managed and franchised properties and other third parties for redemptions. the cost of the points expected to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights, occupancy rates, room rates and any changes to the hilton honors program, including devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in the number of points required to redeem a reward. any amounts received related to the issuance of points that are in excess of the cost per point, as determined by an actuary, are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet and recognized as revenue upon point redemption. we recognize revenue for point redemptions in the amount we expect to retain in excess of the cost per point, inclusive of estimated breakage, and limit the revenue recognized to an amount that is probable to not result in a significant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognized when breakage occurs.
in addition to the hilton honors fees we receive from hotel owners to operate the program, we earn fees from strategic partnerships, including co-branded credit card arrangements, for a license to use our ip and the issuance of hilton honors points. the allocation of the overall fees from the strategic partnerships between the ip license and the hilton honors points is based on their estimated standalone selling prices. the estimated standalone selling price of the ip license is determined using a relief-from-royalty valuation method incorporating statistical formulas based on factors that require significant judgment, including estimates of the usage of the strategic partner's goods or services, an appropriate royalty rate and a discount rate applied to the projected cash flows. the estimated standalone selling price of the future reward redemptions of hilton honors points under the strategic partnerships is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis with the same assumptions as the point redemption liability discussed above, adjusted for an appropriate margin.
changes in our estimates and assumptions that are used to determine our estimated cost per point and the allocation of fees from strategic partnerships between the ip license fee and the hilton honors points could result in material changes in the balances of our liability for guest loyalty program and deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheet. further, the estimates and assumptions used for the allocation of fees could result in material changes to our licensing fees and other revenues from managed and franchised properties recognized in our consolidated statement of operations.
income taxes we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish valuation allowances for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized. in performing this review, we consider all positive and negative evidence available, including, but not limited to, estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income, the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies, all of which require significant use of judgment. a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowances resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, respectively, which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. refer to note 13: "income taxes" for information on the balances of our deferred tax assets and respective valuation allowances as of december 31, 2023.
we record the benefits of income tax positions by recognizing the largest amount of income tax benefit more-likely-than-not to be realized upon resolution. estimating this benefit involves, but is not limited to, interpreting complex tax laws in the multiple jurisdictions where we operate, evaluating the technical merits of each tax position and assessing amounts we would ultimately accept in a negotiated settlement with the tax authorities, if applicable. the complexities and judgment involved in estimating the company's income tax positions could result in payments materially different than the liabilities previously recognized for such expected payments. additionally, as new information becomes available (e.g., legislative changes or administrative rulings) changes in the company's judgment and assumptions could result in adjustments to our existing income tax position recognition. changes to these assumptions and estimates may increase or decrease our existing liabilities, resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit, respectively, which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.
legal contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency will be accrued as a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required when we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss in determining whether an accrual of an estimated loss is appropriate. changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on march 1, 2022, we completed the spinoff of our spine and dental businesses into zimvie. the historical results of our spine and dental businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 results through the date of the spinoff and in the prior year periods. see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. the following discussion and analysis is presented on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted.
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. amounts reported in millions within this annual report on form 10-k are computed based on the actual amounts. as a result, the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. in addition, certain columns and rows within tables may not sum to the totals due to the use of rounded numbers. percentages presented are calculated from the underlying unrounded amounts.
the following discussion, analysis and comparisons generally focus on the operating results for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022. discussion, analysis and comparisons of the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this form 10-k can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022.
executive level overview
2023 financial highlights in 2023, we experienced fewer disruptions to elective surgical procedures from the covid-19 global pandemic as compared to 2022 when the omicron variant and staffing shortages caused widespread deferrals of procedures. in addition, improvements in our supply chain, procedure volume recovery from patients who deferred surgical procedures related to the pandemic, new product introductions and commercial execution have contributed to our net sales growth. as a result, in 2023 our net sales increased by 6.5 percent compared to 2022. our net sales in 2023 were tempered by a negative 1.0 percent effect from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
our net earnings from continuing operations were $1,024.0 million in 2023 compared to $290.2 million in 2022. our net earnings increased in 2023 driven by the higher net sales, favorable tax settlements and lower operating expenses. operating expenses declined primarily due to lower litigation-related, restructuring-related and quality remediation-related charges. in addition, 2022 included $292.8 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairments, and a $116.6 million loss on our investment in zimvie.
2024 outlook we expect year-over-year revenue growth of mid-single digits in 2024 to be driven by a combination of market growth, new product introductions, commercial execution and continued improvements in product supply. based on foreign currency exchange rates at the end of 2023, we expect foreign currency to negatively affect year-over-year net sales by approximately 0.5 percent. we estimate operating profit will increase in 2024 when compared to 2023 due to higher net sales, leverage from fixed operating expenses and savings from our restructuring plans. however, we estimate these favorable items may be partially offset by higher intangible asset amortization and increased restructuring-related costs to implement our plans. we estimate our net interest expense will increase slightly due to higher interest rates. we expect our provision for income taxes will increase in 2024 when compared to 2023 due to the european union adoption of pillar two and the non-reoccurrence of favorable tax settlements.
results of operations we review sales by two geographies, the united states and international, and by the following product categories: knees; hips; s.e.t. (sports medicine, extremities, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic); and other. this sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments, which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate resources toward achieving operating profit goals. we review sales by these geographies because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories, because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies and many of our competitors publicly report in this manner. our business is seasonal in nature to some extent, as many of our products are used in elective surgical procedures, which typically decline during the summer months and can increase at the end of the year once annual deductibles have been met on health insurance plans.

demand (volume/mix) trends changes in volume and mix of product sales had positive effects of 8.1 percent and 7.6 percent on year-over-year sales during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we saw recovery of elective surgical procedures across most of our major markets driving volume growth. in addition, new product introductions and commercial execution contributed positively to volume and mix trends.
pricing trends global selling prices had negative effects of 0.6 percent and 1.0 percent on year-over-year sales during 2023 and 2022, respectively. the majority of countries in which we operate continue to experience pricing pressure from local hospitals, health systems, and governmental healthcare cost containment efforts. however, we have had some success in reducing the negative effects of pricing due to internal initiatives and being able to pass some inflationary impacts on to customers.
foreign currency exchange rates in 2023 and 2022, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had negative effects of 1.0 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively, on year-over-year sales.
geography the 6.9 percent net sales growth in the u.s. in 2023 when compared to 2022 was primarily driven by recovery in surgical procedures as covid-19 caused fewer disruptions, especially in the knees and hips categories. internationally, net sales increased by 6.1 percent in 2023 when compared to 2022. the 2023 international net sales increase was similarly driven by recovery in surgical procedures as covid-19 caused fewer disruptions across most of our major markets, but volume increases were partially offset by the negative impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 2.1 percent.
product categories in 2023, our knees and hips net sales increased by 9.4 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively, when compared to 2022 due to the recovery in elective surgical procedures, improvements in our supply chain and new product introductions. changes in foreign currency exchange rates had negative effects of 0.8 percent and 1.3 percent on 2023 knees and hips net sales, respectively. s.e.t. net sales increased by 3.3 percent in 2023 when compared to 2022. changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative effect of 0.5 percent on 2023 s.e.t. net sales. s.e.t. net sales growth was primarily driven by growth in cmft, sports medicine and upper extremities products of 12.9 percent, 10.6 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively, partially offset by a 5.5 percent decline in trauma. s.e.t.'s performance was also negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in reimbursement for certain restorative therapy products. other product category net sales increased by 11.6 percent in 2023 when compared to 2022 primarily due to higher net sales for our rosa robot.

cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization cost of products sold, excluding intangible asset amortization, increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to higher sales. however, as a percentage of net sales costs of products sold, excluding intangible asset amortization, declined in 2023 compared to 2022. this decline was primarily due to volume and mix shift to higher margin products and markets, higher hedge gains recognized in the current year period as part of our hedging program and lower royalty expense. the reduction in royalty expense was partially the result of agreements we entered into to acquire intellectual property through the buyout of certain licensing arrangements, which are recognized as intangible assets and result in additional intangible asset amortization expense instead of royalty expense. these favorable items were partially offset by higher excess and obsolete inventory charges, inflationary cost pressures and lower average selling prices.
intangible asset amortization expense increased in 2023 when compared to 2022 due to acquisitions we made in 2023, including intangible assets acquired from the buyout of certain royalty-related licensing agreements as described above. however, as a percentage of net sales intangible asset amortization in 2023 was similar to 2022 as amortization expense and net sales increased by a similar percentage.
we calculate gross profit as net sales minus cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization. our gross margin percentage is gross profit divided by net sales. the following table sets forth the factors that contributed to the gross margin changes in each of 2023 and 2022 compared to the prior year:

operating expenses research & development ("r&d") expenses increased in both amount and as a percentage of net sales in 2023 compared to 2022. the increases were driven by higher personnel-related costs, higher spending on our initial compliance with the european union medical device regulation, additional r&d expenses from acquisitions we made in 2023, and other r&d investments.
selling, general & administrative ("sg&a") expenses increased in amount, but decreased as a percentage of net sales in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase in expenses was due to selling and distribution costs that are variable expenses which increase as net sales increase. additionally, personnel-related costs were higher due to additional headcount investments and annual merit increases, and travel and entertainment costs were higher as we have increased these activities from lower pandemic levels. these higher costs were partially offset by lower litigation-related charges in 2023, lower bad debt charges in 2023 as we recognized higher bad debt charges in 2022 that were partially related to the beginning of the russia/ukraine conflict, lower share-based compensation expense in 2023 due to the forfeiture of awards related to employee departures, and a gain recognized in 2023 from the sale of an asset.
in 2023, we did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges. in 2022, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $289.8 million related to our emea reporting unit. in 2022 and 2021, we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of $3.0 million and $16.3 million, respectively, related to ipr&d projects that we discontinued. for more information regarding these charges, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
in december of 2023, 2021 and 2019, we initiated global restructuring programs (the "2023 restructuring plan", the "2021 restructuring plan" and the "2019 restructuring plan", respectively). the 2023 restructuring plan is intended to further streamline the organization, to better align it with our go-to-market strategies and to reduce costs across the organization. the 2021 restructuring plan is intended to further reduce costs and to reorganize our global operations in preparation for the spinoff of zimvie. the 2019 restructuring plan has an objective of reducing costs to allow us to invest in higher priority growth opportunities. we also have other cost reduction and optimization initiatives that have the goal of reducing costs across the organization. we recognized expenses of $151.9 million and $191.6 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily related to employee termination benefits, sales agent contract terminations, and consulting and project management expenses associated with these programs. the expenses were higher in 2022 when compared to 2023 primarily due to additional expenses related to the 2021 restructuring plan that had just been initiated at the end of 2021. we expect restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives expense to increase in 2024 as we further implement our 2023 restructuring plan. for more information regarding these expenses, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
in 2023, we did not recognize any significant quality remediation expenses as we completed our remediation milestones in late 2022 that addressed inspectional observations on form 483 and a warning letter issued by the fda at our warsaw north campus facility, among other matters. this warning letter was resolved in late 2023.
acquisition, integration, divestiture and related expenses relate to acquisitions made in 2023 and 2022, as well as costs related to our separation with zimvie. the increase in these expenses in 2023 was primarily due to higher contingent consideration charges from our various acquisitions.
other (expense) income, net, interest expense, net, and income taxes in 2023, we incurred a loss of $9.3 million in our other (expense) income, net compared to a loss of $128.0 million in 2022. the year-over-year change was primarily due to a loss of $116.6 million recognized in 2022 related to our investment in zimvie, while in 2023 we recognized a gain of $2.5 million prior to disposing of our zimvie shares in february 2023.
interest expense, net, increased in 2023 when compared to 2022, primarily from higher interest rates on borrowings in 2023. in addition, in 2023 we incurred losses of $38.9 million on our fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps compared to losses of $4.0 million in 2022.
our effective tax rate ("etr") on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes was 4.0 percent and 27.9 percent for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. in 2023, the etr was primarily driven by unrecognized tax benefits determined to be effectively settled during 2023. in 2022, the etr was primarily driven by the $289.8 million goodwill impairment charge and the $116.6 million loss on our investment in zimvie, which have no corresponding tax benefits, partially offset by favorable tax settlements and finalization of switzerland's federal act on tax reform and ahv financing ("traf") step-up.
absent discrete tax events, we expect our future etr will be lower than the u.s. corporate income tax rate of 21.0 percent due to our mix of earnings between u.s. and foreign locations, which have lower corporate income tax rates. our etr in future periods could also potentially be impacted by: changes in our mix of pre-tax earnings; changes in tax rates, tax laws or their interpretation, including the european union adoption of pillar two proposals which will begin to take effect in 2024; the outcome of various federal, state and foreign audits, appeals, and litigation; and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. currently, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of all these items on our financial results.

americas in the americas, operating profit increased, but operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased, in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase in operating profit in 2023 was primarily due to higher net sales driven by continued recovery of elective surgical procedures and new product introductions. however, operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in 2023 due to higher carrying expenses from inventory at consigned locations, and continued investments in r&d, including personnel-related costs, which were partially offset by lower royalty expenses as a result of agreements we entered into to acquire intellectual property through the buyout of certain licensing arrangements.
emea in emea, operating profit and operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased in 2023 when compared to 2022. the increases were due to higher net sales driven by continued recovery of elective surgical procedures and improved pricing, lower bad debt charges and operating profit leverage from certain costs that do not increase as net sales increase.
asia pacific in asia pacific, operating profit and operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased in 2023 when compared to 2022. in asia pacific, changes in foreign currency exchange rates have had a larger impact on our results than in our other operating segments. while net sales declined in 2023 when compared to 2022 due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the negative net sales impact was partially offset by higher hedge gains recognized in 2023 from our hedging program. as a result, net sales volume growth and operating leverage from certain costs that do not increase as net sales increase resulted in operating profit and operating profit as a percentage of sales increasing in 2023.
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2023, we had $415.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. in addition, we had $1.0 billion available to borrow under a 364-day revolving credit agreement that matures on july 5, 2024, and $1.5 billion available under a five-year revolving facility that matures on july 7, 2028. the terms of the 364-day revolving credit agreement and the five-year revolving facility are described further in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
we believe that cash flows from operations, our cash and cash equivalents on hand, and available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. however, it is possible our needs may change. further, there can be no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all.
sources of liquidity cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations were $1,581.6 million in 2023 compared to $1,356.2 million in 2022. the increase in 2023 was primarily driven by higher earnings, lower restructuring-related payments and lower tax payments. these favorable items were partially offset by higher investments in inventory in 2023 when compared to 2022, as well as higher bonus payments in 2023.
cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations were $778.9 million in 2023 compared to $522.0 million in 2022. instrument and property, plant and equipment additions reflected ongoing investments in our product portfolio, including new product introductions, optimization of our manufacturing and logistics networks, investments in enterprise resource planning software and a new corporate jet. in addition, in 2023 we paid $134.9 million related to acquisitions and $86.4 million to acquire intellectual property through the buyout of certain licensing arrangements.
cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations were $763.5 million in 2023 compared to $775.7 million in 2022. in 2023, we used the proceeds from draws on our existing credit facilities, along with cash on hand, to repurchase $692.2 million of our common stock. we issued senior notes for $499.8 million and used those proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our existing credit facilities and for general corporate purposes, such that we repaid a net $325.0 million on our various revolving credit facilities and $120.2 million of other debt obligations that were due in the first quarter of 2023.
we place our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. we invest only in high-quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy.
as of december 31, 2023, $343.4 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held in jurisdictions outside of the u.s. of this amount, $55.0 million is denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, bears no foreign currency translation risk. the remaining amount is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate. as discussed in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements, we generally intend to limit distributions such that they would not result in significant u.s. tax costs.
material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations at december 31, 2023, we had outstanding debt of $5,767.9 million, of which $900.0 million was classified as current debt. of our current debt, $850.0 million of senior notes mature on november 22, 2024 and the remaining $50.0 million is outstanding under an uncommitted credit facility which we expect to repay during 2024. we believe we can satisfy these debt obligations with cash generated from our operations, by issuing new debt and/or by borrowing on our committed revolving credit facilities.
for additional information on our debt, including types of debt, maturity dates, interest rates, debt covenants and available revolving credit facilities, see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
in march, may, august and december 2023, our board of directors declared cash dividends of $0.24 per share. we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.
in february 2016, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program effective march 1, 2016, with no expiration date. in 2023, we executed share repurchases to return cash to investors as well as to limit ownership dilution from the issuance of common stock under our share-based compensation programs and in connection with our acquisition of embody, inc. as of december 31, 2023, $155.8 million remained authorized under this program. an additional 0.5 million shares were repurchased in early january 2024 for $64.1 million.
as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, we are executing on a 2023 restructuring plan, a 2021 restructuring plan and a 2019 restructuring plan. the 2023 restructuring plan along with other related initiatives is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of $120 million to $135 million by the end of 2025, of which approximately $13 million was incurred through december 31, 2023. we expect to reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by $175 million to $200 million relative to the 2023 baseline expenses by the end of 2025 as program benefits under the 2023 restructuring plan are realized. the 2021 restructuring plan is expected to result in total pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $180 million by the end of 2024, of which approximately $170 million was incurred through december 31, 2023. we expect to reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $190 million relative to the 2021 baseline expenses by the end of 2024 as program benefits under the 2021 restructuring plan are realized. the 2019 restructuring plan is expected to result in total pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $370 million by the end of 2025, of which approximately $320 million was incurred through december 31, 2023. in our original estimates, we expected to reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $180 million to $280 million relative to the 2019 baseline expenses by the end of 2023 as benefits under the 2019 restructuring plan were realized. our latest estimates indicate that we will be near the low end of that range, and the full benefits will not be realized until we complete the closure of a manufacturing facility, which is expected of occur in 2025.
as discussed in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements, the irs has issued proposed adjustments for years 2010 through 2012, for years 2013 through 2015, and for years 2016 through 2019. we have disputed these proposed adjustments and intend to continue to vigorously defend our positions. although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain, future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows.
under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, we have a $206.2 million liability remaining from a one-time tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of post-1986 untaxed foreign earnings and profits ("transition tax") for the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. as of december, 31, 2023, $51.6 and $154.6 million of this amount is recorded in current income tax liabilities and non-current income tax liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet.
as discussed in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various litigation matters. we estimate the total liabilities for all litigation matters was $244.1 million as of december 31, 2023. we expect to pay these liabilities over the next few years.
in the normal course of business, we enter into purchase commitments, primarily related to raw materials. however, we do not believe these purchase commitments are material to the overall standing of our business or our liquidity.
we have entered into development, distribution and other contractual arrangements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product r&d milestones, sales milestones, or exclusive rights to distribute a product. these estimated payments related to these agreements could range from $0 to $440 million.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements is affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods, and also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. critical accounting estimates are those that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. we believe that the accounting estimates and assumptions described below involve significant subjectivity and judgment, and changes to such estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results.
excess inventory and instruments - we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost. similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. accordingly, inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value. to determine the appropriate net realizable value, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components. the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work‐in‐process inventory, which is recorded at cost. obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. management evaluates the need for changes to the net realizable values of inventory and instruments based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis.
income taxes - our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.
we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction. realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is "more likely than not" that the deferred tax benefit will be realized.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions across our global operations. we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters.
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
commitments and contingencies - we are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims, including product liability, intellectual property, stockholder matters, tax disputes, commercial disputes, employment matters, whistleblower and qui tam claims and investigations, governmental proceedings and investigations, and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of our business. we establish liabilities for loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported.
goodwill and intangible assets - we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the fair value is below its carrying amount. we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets and risk-adjusted discount rates. as such, these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs. changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets.
we have three reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. during our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2023, for two of these reporting units their estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values by more than 50 percent. we estimated the fair value of these reporting units using the income and market approaches. fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology, which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our reporting unit. we performed a qualitative test on the other reporting unit and concluded it was more likely than not the fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
future impairment in our reporting units could occur if the estimates used in the income and market approaches change. if our estimates of profitability in the reporting unit decline, the fair value estimate under the income approach will decline. additionally, changes in the broader economic environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates and comparable company valuation indicators, which may impact our estimated fair values. further, changes in foreign currency exchange rates could increase the cost of procuring inventory and services from foreign suppliers, which could reduce reporting unit profitability.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for information on how recent accounting pronouncements have affected or may affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations, including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments. we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes.
foreign currency exchange risk we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. to reduce the potential effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements on net earnings, we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our foreign currency exchange risk exposure and management.
we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities. our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments be the same as hedged forecasted transactions. on this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges, changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments. as part of our risk management program, we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates. a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31, 2023 indicated that, if the u.s. dollar uniformly strengthened or weakened in value by 10 percent relative to all currencies, with no change in the interest differentials, the fair value of those contracts would affect earnings in a range of a decrease of approximately $114 million to an increase of approximately $105 million before income taxes in periods through june 2026.
any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction. consequently, foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged.
we had net assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets, in legal entities with non-u.s. dollar functional currencies of $1,854.5 million at december 31, 2023.
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one to three months to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity's functional currency. as a result, foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period.
for details about these and other financial instruments, including fair value methodologies, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.
commodity price risk we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome, titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months, where available, on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices. as part of our risk management program, we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes.
interest rate risk in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition. we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities.
we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highly-rated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits. the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation. currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.
the majority of our debt is fixed-rate debt and therefore is not exposed to changes in interest rates. based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31, 2023, a change of 10 percent in interest rates, assuming the principal amount outstanding remains constant, would not have a material effect on interest expense, net. this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment.
credit risk financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments and accounts receivable.
we place our cash and cash equivalents and enter into derivative transactions with highly-rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents or derivative instruments.
our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business. substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the u.s. and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business, economic and country specific variables. our ability to collect accounts receivable in some countries depends in part upon the financial stability of these hospital and healthcare sectors and the respective countries' national economic and healthcare systems. most notably, in europe healthcare is typically sponsored by the government. since we sell products to public hospitals in those countries, we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints and price reduction initiatives. to the extent the respective governments' ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates, we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future.
while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in europe and around the world, there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer. exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate.

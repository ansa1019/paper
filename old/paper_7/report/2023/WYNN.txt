key operating measures certain key operating measures specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which the consolidated statements of operations are presented. these key operating measures are presented as supplemental disclosures because management and/or certain investors use these measures to better understand period-over-period fluctuations in our casino and hotel operating revenues. these key operating measures are defined below:
•table drop in mass market for our macau operations is the amount of cash that is deposited in a gaming table's drop box plus cash chips purchased at the casino cage.
•table drop for our las vegas operations is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box.
•table drop for encore boston harbor is the amount of cash and gross markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box.
•rolling chips are non-negotiable identifiable chips that are used to track turnover for purposes of calculating incentives within our macau operations' vip program.
•turnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our macau operations' vip program.
•table games win is the amount of table drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenues. table games win is before discounts, commissions and the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis. table games win does not include poker rake.
•slot machine win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenues. slot machine win is after adjustment for progressive accruals and free play, but before discounts and the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis.
•poker rake is the portion of cash wagered by patrons in our poker rooms that is retained by the casino as a service fee, after adjustment for progressive accruals, but before the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis. poker tables are not included in our measure of average number of table games.
•average daily rate ("adr") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including complimentaries (less service charges, if any), by total rooms occupied.
•revenue per available room ("revpar") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including complimentaries (less service charges, if any), by total rooms available.
36
•occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms, including complimentary rooms, by the total rooms available.
below is a discussion of the methodologies used to calculate win percentages at our resorts.
in our mass market operations in macau, customers may purchase cash chips at either the gaming tables or at the casino cage. the measurements from our vip and mass market operations are not comparable as the measurement method used in our mass market operations tracks the initial purchase of chips at the table and at the casino cage, while the measurement method from our vip operations tracks the sum of all losing wagers. accordingly, the base measurement from the vip operations is much larger than the base measurement from the mass market operations. as a result, the expected win percentage with the same amount of gaming win is lower in the vip operations when compared to the mass market operations.
in our vip operations in macau, customers primarily purchase rolling chips from the casino cage and can only use them to make wagers. winning wagers are paid in cash chips. the loss of the rolling chips in the vip operations is recorded as turnover and provides a base for calculating vip win percentage. it is customary in macau to measure vip play using this rolling chip method. we typically expect our win as a percentage of turnover from these operations to be within the range of 3.1% to 3.4%.
in las vegas, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables in exchange for cash and markers. customers may then redeem markers at the gaming tables or at the casino cage. the cash and markers, net of redemptions, used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. this is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage. each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. our expected table games win percentage is 22% to 26%.
at encore boston harbor, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables in exchange for cash and markers. customers may then redeem markers only at the casino cage. the cash and gross markers used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. this is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage. each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. our expected table games win percentage is 18% to 22%.

the increase in operating revenues for the year ended december 31, 2023 was primarily driven by increases of $1.48 billion, $902.3 million, and $348.5 million from wynn palace, wynn macau, and our las vegas operations, respectively, resulting from an increase in gaming volumes, hotel occupancy, and covers at restaurants. the results of our macau operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 were negatively impacted by certain travel-related restrictions and conditions, including covid-19 testing, entry restrictions, and other mitigation procedures, related to the covid-19 pandemic. over the course of december 2022 and january 2023, macau authorities eliminated these covid-19 related protective measures, which resulted in increased business volumes at our macau operations for the year ended december 31, 2023.
the increase in net income attributable to wynn resorts, limited for the year ended december 31, 2023 was primarily related to increased operating revenues at our macau operations and our las vegas operations, as well as an income tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets as a result of achieving sustained profitability in the u.s., partially offset by increased operating expenses, and impairment losses for goodwill and intangible assets related to the wynn interactive reportable segment.

the increase in total operating expenses was primarily due to increased operating costs associated with higher business volumes at each of our properties, an increase in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and property charges at wynn interactive, as a result of our decision to close its online sports betting and igaming platform, wynnbet, in certain jurisdictions, and the gain recorded in 2022 in connection with the closing on a sale-leaseback arrangement with respect to certain real estate assets related to encore boston harbor (the "ebh transaction").
casino expenses increased $686.7 million and $396.5 million at wynn palace and wynn macau, respectively. these increases resulted from higher operating costs, including increases of $642.3 million and $381.4 million in incremental gaming tax expense at wynn palace and wynn macau, respectively, driven by the increase in casino revenues.
room expenses increased $28.8 million and $9.7 million at our las vegas operations and wynn palace, respectively. these increases resulted from higher operating costs related to an increase in room revenues at our las vegas operations and wynn palace.
food and beverage expenses increased $69.4 million, $31.5 million, and $17.2 million at our las vegas operations, wynn palace, and wynn macau, respectively. these increases resulted from higher operating costs related to an increase in food and beverage revenues at our las vegas operations, wynn palace, and wynn macau, respectively.
entertainment, retail and other expenses increased $35.5 million at our las vegas operations as a result of higher operating costs associated with live and theatrical entertainment. entertainment, retail and other expenses also increased $19.2 million at our macau operations as a result of higher operating costs associated with increased business volumes. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and other operational costs of $45.4 million at wynn interactive.
general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to triple-net operating lease expense of $139.8 million at encore boston harbor following the sale-leaseback transaction in december 2022, an increase of $29.4 million at our las vegas operations attributable to payroll and other general and administrative expenses required to support higher business volumes, and increased corporate and other general and administrative expenses of $52.3 million, primarily due to development costs.

we incurred a foreign currency remeasurement loss of $11.5 million and a gain of $5.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation of the macau pataca, in relation to the u.s. dollar, on the remeasurements of u.s. dollar denominated debt and other obligations from our macau-related entities drove the variability between periods.
we recorded a gain of $45.1 million and $16.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, from change in derivatives fair value. the change in derivatives fair value for the year ended december 31, 2023 included a gain of $49.7 million recorded in relation to the conversion feature of the wml convertible bonds.

table of contents segment information as further described in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 20, "segment information," we use adjusted property ebitdar to manage the operating results of our segments. adjusted property ebitdar is net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening expenses, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, property charges and other, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to encore boston harbor, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other (including intercompany golf course, meeting and convention, and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, change in derivatives fair value, loss on debt financing transactions, and other non-operating income and expenses. adjusted property ebitdar is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. management uses adjusted property ebitdar as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. we also present adjusted property ebitdar because it is used by some investors to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. gaming companies have historically reported ebitdar as a supplement to gaap. in order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their ebitdar calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. however, adjusted property ebitdar should not be considered as an alternative to operating income (loss) as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with gaap. unlike net income (loss), adjusted property ebitdar does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. we have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to encore boston harbor, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property ebitdar. also, our calculation of adjusted property ebitdar may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

adjusted property ebitdar at wynn palace and wynn macau increased $712.4 million and $462.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2023, respectively, primarily due to an increase in operating revenues of $1.48 billion and $902.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2023, respectively, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. our macau operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 were negatively impacted by certain travel-related restrictions and conditions related to the covid-19 pandemic. over the course of december 2022 and january 2023, the macau authorities relaxed or eliminated covid-19 related protective measures, which resulted in increased business volumes at our macau operations for the year ended december 31, 2023.
adjusted property ebitdar at our las vegas operations increased $145.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in revenues from room and casino operations of $133.1 million and $92.9 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.

(2)excluding wynn macau, limited and subsidiaries.
wynn macau, limited and subsidiaries. wml generates cash from our macau operations to fund working capital requirements as needed. we expect to use this cash to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements at wml and our macau operations, and to service our wml senior notes, wm cayman ii revolver, and wml convertible bonds. wml paid no dividends during 2023 or 2022.
in 2024, wynn macau sa renewed its agreement with the macau government that provides for a payment in lieu of complementary tax on dividend distributions which would otherwise be borne by stockholders of wynn macau sa from january 1, 2023 through december 31, 2025. the payment is $5.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2023.
pursuant to the amended and restated facility agreement dated june 27, 2023, the base rate applicable to loans denominated in u.s. dollars made pursuant to the wm cayman ii revolver transitioned to the term secured overnight financing rate ("term sofr"), plus a credit adjustment spread of 0.10%, plus (b) a margin of 1.875% to 2.875% per annum based on wm cayman ii's leverage ratio on a consolidated basis. the new term sofr base rate became effective july 4, 2023. the loans denominated in hong kong dollars under the wm cayman ii revolver bear interest at hibor plus a margin of 1.875% to 2.875% per annum based on wm cayman ii's leverage ratio on consolidated basis. the final maturity of all outstanding loans under the revolving facility remains unchanged at september 16, 2025. wml, as guarantor, may be subject to certain restrictions on payments of dividends or distributions to its shareholders, unless certain financial criteria have been satisfied.
on march 7, 2023, wml completed an offering (the "offering") of $600.0 million 4.50% convertible bonds due 2029 (the "wml convertible bonds"). the wml convertible bonds are governed by a trust deed dated march 7, 2023 (the "trust deed"). the net proceeds from the offering, after deduction of commission and other related expenses, were $585.9 million. wml intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. the wml convertible bonds bear interest on their outstanding principal amount from and including march 7, 2023 at the rate of 4.50% per annum.
the wml convertible bonds are convertible at the option of the holder thereof into fully paid ordinary shares of wml, at the initial conversion price of approximately hk$10.24 (equivalent to approximately $1.31) per share, subject to and upon compliance with the terms and conditions of the wml convertible bonds (the "terms and conditions," and such right, the "conversion right"). the conversion price is at the fixed rate of hk$7.8497 (equivalent to us$1.00), subject to standard adjustments for certain dilutive events as described in the terms and conditions. wml has the option, in its sole discretion, to pay to the relevant bondholder an amount of cash equivalent in order to satisfy the conversion right in whole or in part.
the holders of the wml convertible bonds have the option to require wml to redeem all or some only of such holder's bonds (i) on march 7, 2027 at their principal amount together with interest accrued but unpaid to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption; or (ii) on the relevant event redemption date (as defined in the terms and conditions) at their principal amount together with interest accrued but unpaid to, but excluding such date, following the occurrence of (a) when the ordinary shares cease to be listed or admitted to trading or are suspended from trading for a period equal to or exceeding 10 consecutive trading days on the stock exchange of hong kong limited, or if applicable, the alternative stock exchange, (b) when there is a change of control (as defined in the terms and conditions), or (c) when less than 25% of wml's total number of issued ordinary shares are held by the public (as interpreted under rule 8.24 of the rules governing the listing of securities on the stock exchange of hong kong limited). the wml convertible bonds may also be redeemed at the option of wml in whole, but not in part, at any time after march 7, 2027, but prior to march 7, 2029, upon giving notice to the bondholders in accordance with the terms and conditions, under certain circumstances specified in the trust deed.

wynn resorts finance, llc and subsidiaries. wynn resorts finance, llc ("wrf" or "wynn resorts finance") generates cash from distributions from its subsidiaries, which include our macau operations, wynn las vegas, and encore boston harbor, and capital contributions from wynn resorts, as required. in addition, wrf may utilize its available revolving borrowing capacity as needed. we expect to use this cash to service our wrf credit facilities, the wrf senior notes and the wynn las vegas senior notes, and to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements as needed.
wrf is a holding company and, as a result, its ability to pay dividends to wynn resorts is dependent on wrf receiving distributions from its subsidiaries, which include wml, wynn las vegas, llc, and wynn ma. the wrf credit agreement contains customary negative and financial covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict wrf's ability to pay dividends or distributions and incur additional indebtedness.

in march 2023, we repurchased all of the outstanding wynn las vegas 4.25% senior notes due 2023 of $500.0 million using cash held by wrf, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest under the terms of their indenture.

the company is currently constructing a phased development adjacent to encore boston harbor, which will include a theater, entertainment venues, gaming facilities, food and beverage facilities, and a parking garage. we expect to incur between $375.0 million and $400.0 million of remaining project costs related to this development, which we expect to complete during the first quarter of 2026.
on june 2, 2023, the company entered into a second amendment to the existing term loan agreement (the "retail term loan amendment") which transitions the benchmark interest rate of the retail term loan from libor to the adjusted daily simple secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") and to make related conforming changes, effective july 3, 2023.

other factors affecting liquidity we may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.
legal proceedings in which we are involved also may impact our liquidity. no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of such proceedings. in addition, litigation inherently involves significant costs. for information regarding legal proceedings, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 18, "commitments and contingencies."
in april 2016, our board of directors has authorized an equity repurchase program of up to $1.00 billion. under the equity repurchase program, we may repurchase the company's outstanding shares from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"). we repurchased 2,206,573 shares of our common stock at an average price of $88.61 per share, for an aggregate cost of $195.5 million under this equity repurchase program during the year ended december 31, 2023. as of december 31, 2023, we had $433.4 million in repurchase authority remaining under the program.
we have in the past repurchased, and in the future, we may periodically consider repurchasing our outstanding notes for cash. the amount of any shares and/or notes to be repurchased, as well as the timing of any repurchases, will be based on business, market and other conditions and factors, including price, contractual requirements or consents, and capital availability.
new business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. we continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in domestic and international markets. there can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. any new development may require us to obtain additional financing. we may decide to conduct any such development through wynn resorts, limited or through subsidiaries separate from the las vegas, boston or macau-related entities.

(1)amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon amounts outstanding and sofr or hibor rates as of december 31, 2023. actual rates will vary.

(3)represents amounts payable under the property transfer agreements (as defined in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 5, "property and equipment, net").
(4)represents payments to executive officers, other members of management and certain key employees. employment agreements generally have three to five year terms and typically indicate a base salary and often contain provisions for discretionary bonuses. certain of the executives are also entitled to a separation payment if terminated without "cause" or upon voluntary termination of employment for "good reason" following a "change of control" (as these terms are defined in the employment contracts).
(5)represents payments to certain communities surrounding encore boston harbor, required as a condition of the gaming license awarded to wynn ma, llc.
(6)other includes open purchase orders, future charitable contributions, performance contracts and other contracts. as further discussed in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 14, "income taxes," we had $135.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2023. due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year and therefore it is not included in the table above as of december 31, 2023.
gaming concession contract on december 16, 2022, wynn macau sa entered into a definitive gaming concession contract (the "gaming concession contract") with the government of macau, pursuant to which wynn macau sa was granted a 10-year gaming concession commencing on january 1, 2023 and expiring on december 31, 2032, to operate games of chance at wynn palace and wynn macau.
in addition to the macau gaming premium and property transfer agreements payment commitments included in the table above, wynn macau sa committed to make certain non-gaming and gaming investments in the amount of mop17.73 billion (approximately $2.20 billion) over the course of the ten-year term of the gaming concession contract. mop16.50 billion (approximately $2.05 billion) of the committed investment will be used for non-gaming capital projects and event programming in connection with, among others, attraction of foreign tourists, conventions and exhibitions, entertainment performances, sports events, culture and art, health and wellness, themed amusement, gastronomy, community tourism and maritime tourism.
wynn macau sa agreed, as part of its commitment for its gaming concession contract, to increase its investment in non-gaming projects (original commitment of mop16.50 billion (approximately $2.05 billion) by 20% once market-wide gross gaming revenues reached mop180.00 billion (approximately $22.36 billion) in any one year (the "trigger event"). as market-wide gross gaming revenue exceeded mop180.00 billion (approximately $22.36 billion) in 2023, the trigger event occurred at the end of 2023 and each gaming concessionaire is now required to increase its original committed investment amount in non-gaming projects by 20%. wynn macau sa will comply with its further investment commitment by investing mop3.30 billion

(approximately $409.9 million) over the course of the remaining 9 years of the gaming concession contract in non-gaming capital projects. the scope, nature and timing of the additional investment in non-gaming capital projects will be mutually agreed between wynn macau sa and the macau sar government in due course and according to the terms of the gaming concession contract.
see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 18, "commitments and contingencies," for additional information regarding the amounts owed under the gaming concession contract and macau gaming law.
wynn al marjan island funding commitment pursuant to the shareholders' agreement governing island 3 ami fz-llc, the unconsolidated entity in which the company has a 40% ownership interest and which owns the wynn al marjan island integrated resort development project in ras al khaimah, united arab emirates, the company, and the entity's other shareholders, have committed to fund the development of the project through capital contributions in an amount up to its pro rata share of at least 20% of the project budget. the amount and timing of such contributions are subject to approval by the entity's shareholders.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. certain of our accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates and on an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates. judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. however, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.
wml convertible bond conversion option derivative on march 7, 2023, wml completed the offering of the wml convertible bonds. the company determined that the conversion feature contained within the wml convertible bonds is not indexed to wml's equity and, as such, is required to be bifurcated from the debt host contract and accounted for as a free-standing derivative (the "wml convertible bonds conversion option derivative"). in accordance with applicable accounting standards, the wml convertible bond conversion option derivative will be reported at fair value as of the end of each reporting period, with changes recognized in the statements of operations.
the company used a binomial lattice model in order to estimate the fair value of the embedded derivative in the wml convertible bonds. inherent in a binomial options pricing model are unobservable (level 3) inputs and assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected term, and dividend yield. the company estimates the volatility of shares of wml common stock based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining term to maturity of the wml convertible bonds. the risk-free interest rate is based on the hong kong and united states benchmark yield curves on the valuation date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining term of the wml convertible bonds. the expected life of the wml convertible bonds is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining term to maturity. the dividend yield is based on the historical wml dividend rate over the last several years. the output of the lattice model can be highly sensitive to fluctuations in its inputs.
sale-leaseback transaction on december 1, 2022, the company closed on a sale-leaseback arrangement with respect to certain real estate assets related to encore boston harbor (the "ebh transaction"). upon closing of the ebh transaction, the company received cash proceeds of approximately $1.70 billion in exchange for the sale of such real estate assets, recognizing a gain on sale of $182.0 million, and concurrently entered into a lease agreement with respect to the sold assets for the purpose of continuing to operate the encore boston harbor integrated resort. upon entering into the lease agreement, the company recognized an operating lease asset and a corresponding operating lease liability of $1.51 billion.
accounting for sale-leaseback transactions requires significant management judgement and estimates, including with respect to the determination of whether the transaction qualifies as a sale as defined within gaap, operating versus finance lease classification, and inputs into the measurement of lease assets and liabilities.
52
table of contents in determining whether the transaction qualifies as a sale, we are required to assess whether a contract exists and if so, whether control has passed to the counterparty in the contract. control indicators include, but are not limited to, whether the entity has a present right to payment for the asset, whether the customer has legal title to the asset, whether the entity has transferred physical possession of the asset, whether the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, and whether the customer has accepted the asset. concluding whether a sale has occurred requires significant judgement in determining whether the rights and obligations created by the sale agreement convey control to the counterparty in the transaction.
in a sale-leaseback arrangement, we are required to determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a finance lease. a finance lease would preclude sale accounting. a lessee is required to classify a lease as a finance lease if, among other factors, 1) the term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset or 2) the present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. lease terms include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that such option will be exercised. the company's operating lease related to encore boston harbor contains an initial term of 30 years from december 2022 to november 2052 with one thirty-year renewal period at the company's option, which, in management judgement, is not considered to be reasonably certain of being exercised. the determination of whether the present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset requires the use of estimates, in both determining the discount rate to measure the present value of the sum of the lease payments and in determining the fair value of the underlying assets. as the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate, which is defined by gaap as the "rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment," to determine the present value of lease payments. inputs into our selected incremental borrowing rate which require management's judgement include quantifying our entity-specific credit risk and risks associated with the economic environment specific to the leased assets. in determining the fair value of the underlying assets, we use a combination of the income, market, and cost approaches, which include inputs such as estimated future cash flows, the selection of recently sold comparable properties, and estimated cost to construct a comparable asset.
allowance for credit losses a substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume. our goal is to maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion. these collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. markers issued at our las vegas operations and encore boston harbor are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states, and united states assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the united states.
the enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the united states varies from country to country. some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement burdensome. we closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the united states. in addition to our internal credit and collection departments, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.
we regularly evaluate our reserve for credit losses based on a specific review of customer accounts and outstanding gaming promoter accounts, taking into consideration the amount owed, the age of the account, the customer's financial condition, management's experience with historical and current collection trends, current economic and business conditions, and management's expectations of future economic and business conditions and forecasts. accounts are written off when management deems them to be uncollectible. recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received.

table of contents the following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (dollars in thousands):
december 31,
2023                                                                                                    2022
casino accounts receivable                                        $218,694                      $171,893
allowance for casino credit losses                                 $34,739                       $74,207
allowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable               15.9   %                      43.2   %
the decrease in allowance for casino credit losses as shown in the table above is primarily due to the impact of historical collection patterns and expectations of current and future collection trends, as well as the specific review of customer accounts. although the company believes that its allowance is adequate, it is possible the estimated amounts of cash collections with respect to receivables could change. our allowance for credit losses is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the risk assessments and judgments by management regarding realizability, the current and expected future state of the economy and our credit policy. our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at each of our resorts. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, 41.8% and 34.3%, respectively, of our outstanding casino accounts receivable balance originated at our macau operations.
as of december 31, 2023, a 100 basis point change in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change the provision for credit losses by approximately $2.2 million.
as our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated allowance for credit losses. accordingly, the associated provision for credit losses may fluctuate. because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods as we become aware of additional information about a customer or changes occur in a region's economy or legal system.
impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets, and goodwill we evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards. for assets to be disposed of we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. for assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. in reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. if an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. all recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired. the company's test of goodwill impairment starts with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. if qualitative factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. for the quantitative analysis, the company compares the fair value of its reporting unit to its carrying value. if the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. however, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill impairment is recorded equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, as a result of the company's decision to cease operating wynn interactive's online sports betting and igaming platform in certain jurisdictions, the company identified interim indicators of impairment related to the goodwill assigned to the wynnbet reporting unit within the wynn interactive reportable segment. as a result, the company performed an impairment test as of december 31, 2023, and determined that the carrying value of its goodwill exceeded the estimated fair value of that reporting unit based on a combination of the income and cost approaches, causing the company to recognize a goodwill impairment loss of $72.1 million. as of december 31, 2023, the company had no remaining goodwill recorded related to the acquisition of betbull limited ("betbull"), a subsidiary of wynn interactive. the company also recognized impairment of other finite-lived intangible assets related to wynn interactive's closed operations totaling $22.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2023.

table of contents during the year ended december 31, 2022, as a result of changes in forecasts and other industry-specific factors and management's decision to cease the operations of betbull limited ("betbull"), a subsidiary of wynn interactive, the company recognized impairment of goodwill and other finite-lived intangible assets of $37.8 million and $10.3 million, respectively.
litigation and contingency estimates we are subject to various claims, legal actions and other contingencies, and we accrue for these matters when they are both probable and estimable. for matters that arose on or prior to the balance sheet date, we estimate any accruals based on the relevant facts and circumstances available through the date of issuance of the financial statements. we include the accruals associated with any contingent matters in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities generally is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. accounting standards require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.
as of december 31, 2023, we had deferred tax assets of $2.20 billion, including a foreign tax credit ("ftc") carryforward of $1.20 billion and deferred tax assets related to interest expense carryforwards of $156.2 million and net operating loss carryforwards of $239.6 million. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the company considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. in this assessment, appropriate consideration was given to all positive and negative evidence including recent operating profitability, forecasts of future earnings, ability to carryback, the reversal of net taxable temporary differences, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies.
in 2023, we considered both the achievement of sustained profitability and cumulative income as well as forecasted income and tax planning strategies to be significant forms of positive evidence. we determined that the positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence and supported a release of a portion of the valuation allowance. therefore, we recorded a $1.10 billion net decrease to valuation allowances, including a $971.7 million decrease to the valuation allowance on ftc carryforwards. of the $971.7 million decrease, $97.5 million relates to current year utilization and $572.6 million relates to expirations of ftcs in 2023. the remaining $301.6 million represents ftcs more likely than not to be realized based on future taxable income and tax planning strategies. we also recorded a $158.0 million decrease in valuation allowance on disallowed interest expense carryforward. the need for valuation allowances against deferred tax assets will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.
as of december 31, 2022, we relied solely on the reversal of net taxable temporary differences in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate. we assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes. the accounting standards prescribe a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
uncertain tax position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes. these accounting standards utilize a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.
as applicable, we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development's base erosion and profit shifting 2.0 ("beps 2.0") project have the potential to lead to changes in the tax laws in numerous countries, including the implementation of a global minimum tax. several countries around the world have enacted or proposed changes to their

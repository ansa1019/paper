overview w.w. grainger, inc. is a broad line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (mro) products and services with operations primarily in north america, japan and the united kingdom (u.k.). grainger uses a combination of its high-touch solutions and endless assortment businesses to serve its customers worldwide, which rely on grainger for products and services that enable them to run safe, sustainable and productive operations.
strategic priorities the company's continued strategic aspiration for 2024 is to relentlessly expand grainger's leadership position by being the go-to partner for people who build and run safe, sustainable, and productive operations. to achieve this, each grainger business has a set of strategic growth drivers to drive top-line revenue and mro market outgrowth. in the high-touch solutions north america (high-touch solutions n.a.) segment, businesses are focused on three areas: advantaged mro solutions, differentiated sales and services, and unparalleled customer service. in the endless assortment segment, businesses are focused on product assortment expansion and innovative customer acquisition and retention capabilities. additionally, all grainger businesses are focused on continuously enhancing our operational processes to improve service and cost through customer experience, technology and supply chain infrastructure which ultimately delivers long-term returns for shareholders.
recent events inflationary cost environment and macroeconomic pressures the global economy continues to experience volatile disruptions including to the commodity, labor and transportation markets, arising from a combination of geopolitical events and various economic and financial factors. these disruptions have affected the company's operations and may continue to affect the company's business, financial condition and results of operations.
the company continues to monitor economic conditions in the u.s. and globally, and the impact of macroeconomic pressures, including repercussions from changes in interest rates, currency exchange fluctuations, inflation and a potential recession on the company's business, customers, suppliers and other third parties. as a result of continued inflation, the company has implemented strategies designed to mitigate certain adverse effects of higher costs while also remaining market price competitive. historically, the company's broad and diverse customer base and the nondiscretionary nature of the company's products to its customers has helped to insulate it from the effects of recessionary periods in the industrial mro market. the full extent and impact of these conditions are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.

non-gaap measures grainger utilizes non-gaap measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. non-gaap measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. organic net sales results exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and results of certain divested businesses in the comparable prior year period post date of divestiture. adjusted results including adjusted sg&a, adjusted operating earnings, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted eps exclude certain non-recurring items, including restructuring charges, asset impairments, gains and losses associated with business divestitures and other non-recurring, infrequent or unusual gains and losses from the company's most directly comparable reported u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) results. the company believes its non-gaap measures provide meaningful information to assist investors in understanding financial results and assessing prospects for future performance as they provide a better baseline for analyzing the ongoing performance of its businesses by excluding items that may not be indicative of core operating results. grainger's non-gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
business divestitures in the fourth quarter of 2023, grainger divested e & r industrial sales, inc. (e&r) and recorded a one-time pre-tax loss on the divestiture of $26 million in sg&a. in the fourth quarter of 2022, grainger divested cromwell's wholly owned software business in the u.k. and recorded a one-time pre-tax gain on the divestiture of $21 million in sg&a. the company does not expect these business exits to have a material effect on its future results of operations.

liquidity and capital resources grainger believes its current balances of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under its revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for the next twelve months. the company expects to continue to invest in its business and return excess cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, which it plans to fund through cash flows generated from operations. grainger also maintains access to capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity.
sources of liquidity cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, grainger had cash and cash equivalents of $660 million and $325 million, respectively. the increase in cash was primarily due to cash flows from operations and favorable year-over-year working capital, partially offset by higher capital expenditures and higher volume of share repurchases. the company had approximately $1.9 billion in available liquidity as of december 31, 2023.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of grainger's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are in conformity with gaap and the company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company's management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts. the company considers an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) it involves assumptions that are uncertain when judgment was applied, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on grainger's consolidated financial position and results. while the company believes the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable, the company's management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8: financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements.
inventories company inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. the majority of the company's inventory is accounted for using the last-in, first-out (lifo) method. market value is based on an analysis of inventory trends including, but not limited to, reviews of inventory levels, sales and cost information and on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product and shelf-life. the company's methodology for estimating whether adjustments are necessary is continually evaluated for factors including significant changes in product demand, liquidation or disposition history values and market conditions such as inflation and other acquisition costs, including freight and duties. if business or economic conditions change, estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate.
goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators exist. the fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow method and utilizing value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values. the company's indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily trade names. the fair value of trade names is calculated primarily using the relief-from-royalty method, which estimates the expected royalty savings attributable to the ownership of the trade name asset.
the estimates used to calculate the fair values of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets involve the use of significant assumptions, estimates and judgments and changes from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, macroeconomic developments and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impairment for each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset. for further information on the company's goodwill and other intangible assets, see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8: financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k.
contingencies and legal matters the company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. the company accrues for costs relating to litigation claims and other contingent matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. for further information on the company's contingencies and legal matters, see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8: financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k.

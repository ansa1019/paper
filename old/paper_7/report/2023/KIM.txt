item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form 10-k. historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of income contained in the consolidated financial statements, including trends, should not be taken as indicative of future operations.
the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of the company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the company has a controlling interest, including where the company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the consolidation guidance of the fasb accounting standards codification. the company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost, equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate. the company evaluates performance on a property specific or transactional basis and does not distinguish its principal business or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of measuring performance. accordingly, the company believes it has a single reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap").
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. in preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. these estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to materiality. the company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k. the company is required to make subjective assessments, of which, the most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives, valuation of real estate and intangible assets and liabilities, and valuation of joint venture investments and other investments. the company's reported net earnings are directly affected by management's estimate of impairments. application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties, and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
trade accounts receivable the company reviews its trade accounts receivable, related to base rents, straight-line rent, expense reimbursements and other revenues for collectability. the company evaluates the probability of the collection of the lessee's total accounts receivable, including the corresponding straight-line rent receivable balance on a lease-by-lease basis. determining the probability of collection of substantially all lease payments during a lease term requires significant judgment. the company's analysis of its accounts receivable included (i) customer credit worthiness, (ii) assessment of risk associated with the tenant, and (iii) current economic trends. in addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. the company includes provision for doubtful accounts in revenues from rental properties, net. if a lessee's accounts receivable balance is considered uncollectible, the company will write-off the receivable balances associated with the lease and will only recognize lease income on a cash basis. in addition to the lease-specific collectability assessment, the analysis also recognizes a general reserve, as a reduction to revenues from rental properties, for its portfolio of operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the company's historical and current collection experience and the potential for settlement of arrears. although the company estimates uncollectible receivables and provides for them through charges against revenues from rental properties, actual results may differ from those estimates. for example, in the event that the company's collectability determinations are not accurate, and the company is required to write off additional receivables equaling 1% of the outstanding accounts and notes receivable, net balance at december 31, 2023, the company's rental income and net income would decrease by $3.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2023. if the company subsequently determines that it is probable it will collect the remaining lessee's lease payments under the lease term, any outstanding lease receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) are reinstated with a corresponding increase to rental income.
real estate valuation of real estate, and intangible assets and liabilities the company's investments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized.
28
transaction costs related to acquisitions that qualify as asset acquisitions are capitalized as part of the cost basis of the acquired assets, while transaction costs for acquisitions that are deemed to be business combinations are expensed as incurred. also, upon acquisition of real estate operating properties in either an asset acquisition or business combination, the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases, and tenant relationships, where applicable), assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. fair value is determined based on a market approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
buildings and building improvements (in years)                                                 5 to 50

fixtures, leasehold and tenant improvements (including certain identified intangible assets)   terms of leases or useful lives, whichever is shorter the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. these assessments have a direct impact on the company's net earnings.
during 2023, the company acquired properties for a total purchase price of $346.0 million of which, $5.0 million, or less than 1.4% of the total purchase price, was allocated to above-market leases and $29.3 million, or 8.5% of the total purchase price, was allocated to below-market leases. if the amounts allocated in 2023 to above-market and below-market leases were each reduced by 1% of the total purchase price, the net annual market lease amortization through rental income would decrease by $1.1 million (using the weighted average life of above-market and below-market leases at each respective acquired property).
on a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance, changes in anticipated holding period, general market conditions and delays of development, that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. a property value is considered impaired only if management's estimate of current and projected operating cash flows, net of anticipated construction and leasing costs (undiscounted and unleveraged), of the property over its anticipated hold period is less than the net carrying value of the property. such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future costs of materials and labor, operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. to the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. the company's estimated fair values are primarily based upon estimated sales prices from signed contracts or letters of intent from third-parties, discounted cash flow models or third-party appraisals. estimated fair values that are based on discounted cash flow models include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon unobservable rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates.
see footnotes 3 and 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for further discussion.
valuation of joint venture investments and other investments on a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the company's investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. an investment's value is impaired only if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other-than-temporary. to the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. estimated fair values which are based on discounted cash flow models include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period, capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon unobservable rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates.
see footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for further discussion of the company's accounting policies and estimates.

the company faces external factors which may influence its future results from operations. there remains significant uncertainty in the current macro-economic environment, driven by inflationary pressures, as well as ongoing supply chain issues. these factors have impacted, and are expected to continue to impact, consumer discretionary spending and many of our tenants. the convenience and availability of e-commerce has continued to impact the retail sector, which could affect our ability to increase or maintain rental rates and our ability to renew expiring leases and/or lease available space. to better position itself, the company's strategy has been to attract local area customers to its properties by providing a diverse and robust tenant base across a variety of retailers, including grocery stores, off-price retailers, discounters and service-oriented tenants, which offer buy online and pick up in store, off-price merchandise and day-to-day necessities rather than high-priced luxury items.
the company's portfolio is focused on first ring suburbs around major metropolitan-area u.s. markets, predominantly on the east and west coasts and in the sun belt region, which are supported by strong demographics, significant projected population growth, and where the company perceives significant barriers to entry. the company owns a predominantly grocery-anchored portfolio clustered in the nation's top markets. the company believes it can continue to increase its occupancy levels, rental rates and overall rental growth. in addition, the company, on a selective basis, has developed or redeveloped projects which include residential and mixed-use components.
as part of the company's investment strategy, each property is evaluated for its highest and best use, which may include residential and mixed-use components. in addition, the company may consider other opportunistic investments related to retailer controlled real estate, such as, repositioning underperforming retail locations, retail real estate financing and bankruptcy transaction support. the company may continue to dispose of certain properties. if the estimated fair value for any of these assets is less than their net carrying values, the company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material. for a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results, performance or transactions, see item 1a. risk factors.

the increase in real estate taxes of $6.8 million is primarily due to properties acquired during 2023 and 2022, partially offset by dispositions during 2023 and 2022.
32
operating and maintenance -
the increase in operating and maintenance expense of $18.8 million is primarily due to (i) an increase in insurance expense of $7.4 million, (ii) an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of $5.9 million, and (iii) an increase in operating costs of $5.4 million, primarily related to properties acquired during 2023 and 2022, partially offset by (iv) dispositions during 2023 and 2022.
general and administrative -

merger charges -
during the year ended december 31, 2023, the company incurred costs of $4.8 million associated with the rpt merger, primarily comprised of professional and legal fees (see footnote 28 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k).

gain/(loss) on marketable securities, net -
the change in gain/(loss) on marketable securities, net of $336.8 million is primarily the result of mark-to-market fluctuations of the aci shares of common stock held by the company and the sale of aci shares of common stock during 2023 and 2022.
interest expense -
the increase in interest expense of $23.4 million is primarily due to a decrease in fair market value amortization resulting from the repayment of senior unsecured notes in 2022 and the issuance of $500.0 million 6.400% senior unsecured notes during 2023.
early extinguishment of debt charges -
during 2022, the company repaid its $500.0 million 3.40% senior unsecured notes, which were scheduled to mature in november 2022. as a result, the company incurred a prepayment charge and wrote-off deferred financing costs during 2022.
33
provision for income taxes, net -
the increase in provision for income taxes, net of $4.3 million is primarily due to the company's sale of shares of aci common stock during 2023, which generated an increased taxable long-term capital gain as compared to 2022. the company elected to retain the proceeds from the sale and as a result incurred federal and state income tax aggregating $60.9 million on such gain.
equity in income of joint ventures, net -
the decrease in equity in income of joint ventures, net of $37.2 million is primarily due to (i) higher gains of $29.8 million recognized on sale of properties within various joint venture investments during 2022 as compared to 2023, (ii) an increase in interest expense of $7.2 million and (iii) lower equity in income in 2023 as compared to 2022 by $3.8 million, partially offset by (iv) lower impairments in 2023 as compared to 2022 by $3.6 million.
equity in income of other investments, net -

although the company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the company in short-term money market or other suitable instruments. the company's objective is to establish a dividend level that maintains compliance with the company's reit taxable income distribution requirements. on october 23, 2023, the company's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend with respect to the company's classes of cumulative redeemable preferred shares (classes l and m) which were paid on january 16, 2024, to shareholders of record on january 2, 2024. also, the company's board of directors declared a "stub period" cash dividend with respect to the company's newly issued class n preferred stock, payable on january 16, 2024 to shareholders of record on january 5, 2024.
in addition, the company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per common share, which was paid on december 21, 2023, to shareholders of record on december 7, 2023. also, as discussed above, on november 12, 2023, the company's board of directors declared a special cash dividend $0.09 per common share, which was paid on december 21, 2023, to shareholders of record on december 7, 2023.
on january 30, 2024, the company's board of directors declared quarterly dividends with respect to the company's classes of cumulative redeemable preferred shares (classes l, m and n), which are scheduled to be paid on april 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on april 1, 2024. additionally, on january 30, 2024, the company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per common share payable on march 21, 2024 to shareholders of record on march 7, 2024.
contractual obligations and other commitments contractual obligations the company has debt obligations relating to its credit facility (no outstanding balance as of december 31, 2023), unsecured senior notes and mortgages with maturities ranging from less than one month to 26 years. as of december 31, 2023, the company's consolidated total debt had a weighted average term to maturity of 8.7 years. in addition, the company has non-cancelable leases pertaining to its shopping center portfolio. as of december 31, 2023, the company had 38 consolidated shopping center properties that are subject to long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land or a portion of the underlying land to the company to construct and/or operate a shopping center. amounts due in 2024 in connection with these leases aggregate $11.8 million. the following table summarizes the company's consolidated debt maturities (excluding extension options, unamortized debt issuance costs of $66.2 million and fair market value of debt adjustments aggregating $24.4 million) and obligations under non-cancelable operating leases as of december 31, 2023:

as of december 31, 2023, the company had $646.8 million of consolidated unsecured debt (of which $246.2 million was subsequently repaid) and $12.2 million of consolidated secured debt scheduled to mature in 2024. the company anticipates satisfying the remaining future maturities with available cash, operating cash flows and/or debt financing.
commitments the company has issued letters of credit in connection with the completion and repayment guarantees, primarily on certain of the company's redevelopment projects and guaranty of payment related to the company's insurance program. at december 31, 2023, these letters of credit aggregated $39.2 million.
40
the company has investments with funding commitments of $64.7 million, of which $51.8 million has been funded as of december 31, 2023.
in connection with the construction of its development/redevelopment projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require posting of performance and surety bonds to guarantee that the company's obligations are satisfied. these bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. as of december 31, 2023, the company had $18.4 million in performance and surety bonds outstanding.
the company provides a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on series a bonds issued by the sheridan redevelopment agency which are tax increment revenue bonds issued in connection with a property owned by the company in sheridan, colorado. these tax increment revenue bonds have a balance of $41.0 million outstanding at december 31, 2023. the bonds are to be repaid with incremental sales and property taxes and a public improvement fee ("pif") to be assessed on current and future retail sales and, to the extent necessary, any amounts we may have to provide under a guaranty. the revenue generated from incremental sales, property taxes and pif have satisfied the debt service requirements to date. the incremental taxes and pif are to remain intact until the earlier of the payment of the bond liability in full or 2040.
off-balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated real estate joint ventures the company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. these joint ventures primarily operate shopping centers or mixed-use properties. the properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non-recourse mortgage loans, however, the company, on a selective basis, has obtained unsecured financing for certain joint ventures. as of december 31, 2023, the company did not guarantee any joint venture unsecured debt. non-recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders' sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. the lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents (see footnote 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k).
debt balances within the company's unconsolidated joint venture investments for which the company held noncontrolling ownership interests at december 31, 2023, aggregated $1.2 billion. as of december 31, 2023, these loans had scheduled maturities ranging from three months to 7.5 years and bore interest at rates ranging from 2.95% to sofr plus 210 basis points (7.41% as of december 31, 2023). approximately $112.9 million of the aggregate outstanding loan balance matures in 2024. these maturing loans are anticipated to be repaid with operating cash flows, debt refinancing, unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from sales of properties within the respective entities, and partner capital contributions, as deemed appropriate (see footnote 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k).
other investments the company has provided capital to owners and developers of real estate properties through its preferred equity program, which is included in other investments on the company's consolidated balance sheets. in addition, the company has invested capital in structured investments, which are primarily accounted for on the equity method of accounting. as of december 31, 2023, the company's other investments were $144.1 million, of which the company's net investment under the preferred equity program was $104.1 million. as of december 31, 2023, these preferred equity investment properties had non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating $231.2 million. these loans have scheduled maturities of less than one year and bear interest at rates ranging from 4.19% to sofr plus 265 basis points (8.14% as of december 31, 2023). these maturing loans are anticipated to be repaid with operating cash flows, debt refinancing, proceeds from sales of properties within the respective entities, and partner capital contributions, as deemed appropriate. due to the company's preferred position in these investments, the company's share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows. the company's maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is limited to its invested capital.
effects of inflation many of the company's long-term leases contain provisions designed to help mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or as a result of escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. in addition, many of the company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. to assist in partially mitigating the company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, resulting from inflation, the company's leases include provisions that either (i) require the tenant to pay an allocable share of these operating expenses or (ii) contain fixed contractual amounts, which include escalation clauses, to reimburse these operating expenses.

funds from operations funds from operations ("ffo") is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. nareit defines ffo as net income/(loss) available to the company's common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap, excluding (i) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, (iii) gains and losses from change in control, (iv) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and (v) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis. the company also made an election, in accordance with the nareit funds from operations white paper-2018 restatement, to exclude from its calculation of ffo (i) gains and losses on the sale of assets and impairments of assets incidental to its main business and (ii) mark-to-market changes in the value of its equity securities. as such, the company does not include gains/impairments on land parcels, mark-to-market gains/losses from marketable securities, allowance for credit losses on mortgage receivables, gains/impairments on other investments or other amounts considered incidental to its main business in nareit defined ffo.
the company presents ffo available to the company's common shareholders as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits, many of which present ffo available to the company's common shareholders when reporting results. comparison of our presentation of ffo available to the company's common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits.
ffo is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performances, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap, and therefore, should not be considered an alternative for net income or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity.

same property net operating income same property noi is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with gaap or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. the company considers same property noi as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods. it excludes properties under redevelopment, development and pending stabilization; properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a project's inclusion in operating real estate. same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the company's properties.
same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees, tifs and amortization of above/below-market rents) less charges for credit losses, operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company's proportionate share of same property noi from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. the company's method of calculating same property noi available to the company's common shareholders may differ from methods used by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.
the following is a reconciliation of net income/(loss) available to the company's common shareholders to same property noi (in thousands):

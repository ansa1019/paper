medicaid key factors affecting results for this segment include:
•our growth initiatives, including acquisitions and expansion into new states, drove an increase in member months during the year, despite the impact of redeterminations, and changes in membership mix;
•impact of redetermination, including the loss of approximately 500,000 members, and a moderate impact from the effect of acuity shifts, net of the beneficial impact of risk corridors; and
•improved operating performance, including medical cost management, and prospective and retrospective rates.
medicaid premium revenue increased $1.5 billion, or 6% in 2023, when compared with 2022. the increase was mainly due to the impact of our growth initiatives, changes in business and membership mix, and the beneficial impact of risk corridors in several states. we benefited from membership growth related to the suspension of redeterminations through the end of the first quarter of 2023. additionally, membership increased due to the agewell acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2022, the commencement of the iowa medicaid contract in july 2023, and the impact from the my choice wisconsin acquisition that closed on september 1, 2023. these increases were partially offset by the net membership impact of redetermination. by the end of the third quarter of 2023, all states within our medicaid footprint had begun disenrolling members, which is expected to continue through the first half of 2024.
the medical margin of our medicaid program decreased $8 million in 2023, when compared with 2022. the year-over-year change was driven by an increase in mcr, partially offset by the increased premium revenues discussed above.
the medicaid mcr increased 70 basis points to 88.7% in 2023, from 88.0% in 2022. the increase was mainly attributable to changes in business and membership mix, including acquisitions and commencement of the iowa contract, and a modest acuity impact from redetermination, partially offset by prospective and retrospective rates, the beneficial impact of risk corridor offsets in several states, and improved operating performance. the medicaid mcr for the year ended december 31, 2023 is consistent with our long-term target range.
medicare key factors affecting results for this segment include:
•increased utilization of supplemental benefits, in-home services, and high-cost drugs;
•our continued expansion in mapd and d-snp membership; and
•the impact of lower risk-adjusted premiums associated with the new mapd and d-snp members, partially offset by higher risk scores on renewing members.
medicare premium revenue increased $384 million, or 10%, in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase was primarily due to the impact of mapd and d-snp membership expansion, including organic membership growth in existing states and the closing of my choice wisconsin on september 1, 2023.
the medical margin for medicare decreased $49 million in 2023 compared to 2022. the year-over-year decrease was mainly due to the increase in mcr discussed below, partially offset by the increase in the premium revenues.

risk scores on renewing members that more closely reflect the acuity of our membership. the medicare mcr for the year ended december 31, 2023 is above our long-term target range.
marketplace key factors affecting results for this segment include:
•execution of our product and pricing strategy, which resulted in an overall reduction in membership, repositioning in the metallic tier membership mix, and returning the business to target margins; and
•achievement of member risk scores and associated risk-adjusted premium that are commensurate with the health status, or acuity, of our marketplace members.
marketplace premium revenue decreased $238 million in 2023 compared to 2022. the decrease was mainly due to an expected decrease in membership in line with our product and pricing strategy, partially offset by an increase in premium revenue pmpm. our marketplace membership as of december 31, 2023, amounted to 281,000 members, representing a decrease of 67,000 members compared to december 31, 2022. the increase in premium revenue pmpm was due to higher silver metal tier product mix consistent with the product and pricing strategy and higher risk adjustment premiums.
the marketplace medical margin increased $209 million in 2023, primarily due to the decrease in mcr discussed below, partially offset by the decrease in membership and premiums.
the marketplace mcr decreased to 75.3% in 2023, compared to 87.2% in 2022, or 1,190 basis points. the decrease in 2023 resulted mainly from our product and pricing strategy to achieve our target margins, including higher risk adjustment premium on silver metal tier and renewal members, commensurate with the acuity profile of those members. in addition, the comparison reflects a favorable change in the 2022 risk adjustment payable recognized in 2023 compared to an unfavorable change in the 2021 risk adjustment payable recognized in 2022. silver metal tier products incur less mcr seasonality than bronze metal tier products due to lower deductibles. these impacts were partially offset by changes in membership mix discussed above. our 2023 marketplace mcr was well below our long-term target range.
other the other segment includes service revenues and costs associated with the long-term services and supports consultative services we provide in wisconsin, and also includes certain corporate amounts not allocated to the medicaid, medicare, or marketplace segments. such amounts were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations for 2023 and 2022.
liquidity, financial condition and capital resources liquidity we manage our cash, investments, and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. we forecast, analyze, and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy.
we maintain liquidity at two levels: 1) the regulated health plan subsidiaries; and 2) the parent company.
our regulated health plan subsidiaries' primary liquidity requirements include payment of medical claims and other health care services; payment of certain settlements with our state and federal customers, such as minimum medical loss ratio and risk corridors and marketplace risk transfers on behalf of cms; general and administrative costs directly incurred or paid through an administrative services agreement to the parent company; and federal tax payments to the parent company under an intercompany tax sharing agreement. our regulated health plan subsidiaries meet their liquidity needs by generating cash flows from operating activities, primarily from premium revenue; cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments; and capital contributions received from our parent company.
our regulated health plan subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus. we continue to maintain levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our regulated health plan subsidiaries that we believe are appropriate. see further discussion under "regulatory capital and dividend restrictions" below. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plan subsidiaries is generally paid in the form of dividends to our parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. the regulated health plan subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent company amounting to $705 million in 2023 and $668 million in 2022.

parent company liquidity requirements generally consist of payment of administrative costs not directly incurred by our regulated operations, including, but not limited to, staffing costs, lease payments, branding and certain information technology services; capital contributions paid to our regulated health plan subsidiaries, including funding for newer health plans; capital expenditures; debt service; funding for common stock purchases, acquisitions and other growth-related activities; and federal tax payments. the parent company contributed capital of $221 million and $159 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, to our regulated health plan subsidiaries to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements. the higher contributions in 2023 were mainly attributed to fund growth in our wisconsin and iowa health plans. our parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements from administrative services fees earned under administrative services agreements; dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries; federal tax payments collected from the regulated subsidiaries; proceeds received from the issuance of debt and equity securities; and cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments.
cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company amounted to $742 million and $375 million as of december 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. the increase in 2023 was primarily due to the dividends received from our regulated health plan subsidiaries, partially offset by the timing of corporate payments, capital contributions to regulated health plan subsidiaries and net cash paid for acquisitions. on january 1, 2024, we closed on our acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of brand new day and central health plan of california for $441 million. see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, "business combinations," for further information.
investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, and marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. these investments are made pursuant to board-approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations.
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital, and maximize total return on invested assets, all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest. these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of less than 15 years, or less than 15 years average life for structured securities. professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents. our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments where the loss position of those investments exceeds certain levels.
the overall rating of our portfolio is a+. our investment policy has directives in conjunction with state guidelines to minimize risks and exposures in volatile markets. additionally, our portfolio managers assist us in navigating the current volatility in the capital markets.
our restricted investments are invested principally in cash, cash equivalents, u.s. treasury securities, and corporate debt securities; we have the ability to hold such restricted investments until maturity. all of our unrestricted investments are classified as current assets.
cash flow activities our cash flows are summarized as follows:

operating activities we typically receive capitation payments monthly, in advance of payments for medical claims; however, government payors may adjust their payment schedules, positively or negatively impacting our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period. for example, government payors may delay our premium payments, or they may prepay the following month's premium payment.
net cash provided by operations was $1,662 million in 2023, compared with $773 million in 2022. the $889 million increase in 2023 cash flow was due to the growth in operations and net earnings from organic and new rfp starts and acquisitions, accompanied by the net impact of timing differences in government receivables and payables.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $744 million in 2023, compared with $790 million in 2022. the change in cash flow was primarily due to the net activity of proceeds and purchases of investments, which were net purchases of $661 million in 2023 and net purchases of $515 million in 2022. in 2023 and 2022, net cash outflow related to acquisitions was $3 million and $134 million, respectively.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $58 million in 2023, compared with $441 million in 2022, an increase in year-over-year cash flow of $383 million. in 2023, cash outflows included $60 million for common stock withheld to settle employee tax obligations. in 2022, cash outflows included common stock purchases of $400 million and $54 million for common stock withheld to settle employee tax obligations. additionally, we paid $20 million in 2022 to settle contingent consideration liabilities.
financial condition we believe that our cash resources, borrowing capacity available under our credit agreement as discussed further below in "future sources and uses of liquidity-future sources," and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations, regulatory requirements, debt repayment obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
on a consolidated basis, as of december 31, 2023, our working capital was $4.4 billion compared with $3.2 billion as of december 31, 2022. at december 31, 2023, our cash and investments amounted to $9.4 billion, compared with $7.7 billion of cash and investments at december 31, 2022. a significant portion of our portfolio is held in cash and cash equivalents and we do not anticipate the fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position since we intend to hold our securities to maturity. net unrealized losses on our investments classified as current and available for sale decreased to $108 million at december 31, 2023 compared to $210 million at december 31, 2022. we have determined that the unrealized losses primarily resulted from fluctuating interest rates, rather than a deterioration of the creditworthiness of the issuers.
because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plan subsidiaries to transfer net assets to us, the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders is generally limited to cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our unregulated parent. for more information, see the "liquidity" discussion presented above.
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions each of our regulated, wholly owned subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulations. such statutes, regulations and capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions, loans or advances that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. to the extent our subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. based upon current statutes and regulations, the minimum capital and surplus requirement for these subsidiaries was estimated to be approximately $2.3 billion at both december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022. the aggregate capital and surplus of our wholly owned subsidiaries was in excess of these minimum capital requirements as of both dates.
under applicable regulatory requirements, the amount of dividends that may be paid by our wholly owned subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities as of december 31, 2023, was approximately $380 million in the aggregate. the subsidiaries may pay dividends over this amount, but only after approval is granted by the regulatory authorities.

based on our cash and investments balances as of december 31, 2023, management believes that our regulated wholly owned subsidiaries remain well capitalized and exceed their regulatory minimum requirements. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements.
capital structure in september 2023, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $750 million of our common stock. this new program supersedes the stock purchase program previously approved by our board of directors in november 2022 and extends through december 31, 2024.
as debt held by the parent company comes due, we typically engage in a new private offering of debt to retire and replace the prior issuance. for several years we saw a continued decline in interest rates, which benefited our overall cost of capital during that time. however, interest rates have increased since we issued our 3.875% notes due 2032 in 2021. accordingly, future refinancing may occur at a higher rate than those we have achieved historically. this would increase our cost of capital in the future or may cause us to pursue alternative financing sources, should the need arise.
we are not a party to any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
debt ratings each of our senior notes is rated "bb-" by standard & poor's, and "ba3" by moody's investor service, inc. a downgrade in our ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and increase our borrowing costs.
financial covenants the credit agreement contains customary non-financial and financial covenants, including a net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. such ratios are computed as defined by the terms of the credit agreement.
in addition, the indentures governing each of our outstanding senior notes contain cross-default provisions that are triggered upon default by us or any of our subsidiaries on any indebtedness in excess of the amount specified in the applicable indenture. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants under the credit agreement and other long-term debt.
future sources and uses of liquidity future sources our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue, which is generally received a short time before related healthcare services are paid. premium revenue is our primary source of liquidity. thus, any decline in the receipt of premium revenue, and our profitability, could have a negative impact on our liquidity.
regulatory developments. excluding acquisitions and our exit from puerto rico, we estimate we added approximately one million new medicaid members since march 31, 2020, when we first began to report on the impacts of the pandemic. we believe this membership increase was mainly due to the suspension of redeterminations for medicaid eligibility. the consolidated appropriations act of 2023 authorized states to resume redeterminations and terminate coverage for ineligible enrollees starting on april 1, 2023, irrespective of the status of the phe. consequently, during the third quarter of 2023, all states in which we operate had begun disenrolling members. in 2023, we estimate we lost approximately 500,000 members due to redeterminations, offset by new enrollment and expect to lose an additional 100,000 members in 2024. given the high number of procedural terminations and increasing interventions by cms and various states, we expect reconnects will likely continue, decreasing currently reported losses. although the medical cost profile of members who have been disenrolled is more favorable than the medicaid segment average, when combined with the beneficial impact of corridor offsets in several states, our medicaid mcr for the year ended december 31, 2023 was within our expectations. based on the experience to date, we expect that we will ultimately retain approximately 40% of the membership gained since march 31, 2020.
dividends from subsidiaries. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid in the form of dividends to our unregulated parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. for more information on our regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions, refer to notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15, "commitments and contingencies-regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions," and note 17, "condensed financial information of registrant-note c - dividends and capital contributions."

credit agreement borrowing capacity. as of december 31, 2023, we had available borrowing capacity of $1 billion under the credit facility. in addition, the credit agreement provides for a $15 million swingline sub-facility and a $100 million letter of credit sub-facility, as well as incremental term loans available to finance certain acquisitions up to $500 million, plus an unlimited amount of such term loans as long as we maintain a minimum consolidated net leverage ratio. see further discussion in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "debt."
future uses common stock purchases. in september 2023, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $750 million of our common stock. this new program supersedes the stock purchase program previously approved by our board of directors in november 2022 and extends through december 31, 2024. the exact timing and amount of any repurchase is determined by management based on market conditions and share price, in addition to other factors, and subject to the restrictions relating to volume, price, and timing under applicable law. as of february 13, 2024, $750 million remained available to purchase our common stock under this program through december 31, 2024. see further information in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 13, "stockholders' equity."
acquisitions. we have a disciplined and steady approach to growth. organic growth, which includes leveraging our existing health plan portfolio and winning new territories, is our highest priority. in addition to organic growth, we will consider targeted acquisitions that are a strategic fit that we believe will leverage operational synergies, and lead to incremental earnings accretion. for further information on our acquisitions, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, "business combinations."
on january 1, 2024, we closed on our acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of brand new day and central health plan of california for $441 million.
regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with minimum statutory capital requirements.
the molina healthcare charitable foundation. in 2020, we announced our commitment of $150 million to fund the molina healthcare charitable foundation (the "foundation"), an independent not-for-profit charitable foundation. we have contributed $20 million to the foundation on a cumulative basis as of december 31, 2023. in the first three years of its existence, our charitable foundation funded nearly 700 grants to local community organizations in 25 states that address social determinants of health, disaster relief, mental health, maternal child health and other health-related concerns afflicting our communities in need.
contractual obligations. we are party to various contractual obligations that we will be required to satisfy over the short and long term. the majority are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and primarily include the following:
•medical claims and benefits payable. see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," and note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable," for further detail.
•amounts due government agencies. see notes to consolidated financial statements, notes 2, "significant accounting policies," for further detail.
•debt obligations. see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "debt," for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. interest payments are paid semi-annually.
•leases. see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 8, "leases," for further detail of our finance and operating lease obligations and the timing of expected future payments.
some items are based on management's estimates and assumptions about obligations, including duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties, and other factors. because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary. additionally, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring services used in our operations. however, we believe these other agreements do not contain material non-cancelable commitments.
critical accounting estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. actual results could differ from these estimates, and some differences could be material. our most significant accounting estimates, which include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity, include the following:

•medical costs, claims and benefits payable. see discussion below, and refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," and note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable" for more information.
•premium revenue recognition and amounts due government agencies: risk adjustment. for a discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies."
•business combinations, and goodwill and intangible assets, net. for a comprehensive discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," note 4, "business combinations," and note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net."
medical care costs, medical claims and benefits payable medical care costs are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include fee-for-service claims, pharmacy benefits, capitation payments to providers, and various other medically-related costs. under fee-for-service claims arrangements with providers, we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided and incur costs based on actual utilization of hospital and physician services. such medical care costs include amounts paid by us as well as estimated medical claims and benefits payable for costs that were incurred but not paid as of the reporting date ("ibnp"). pharmacy benefits represent payments for members' prescription drug costs, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. we estimate pharmacy rebates based on historical and current utilization of prescription drugs and contractual provisions. capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees paid to providers, who are responsible for providing medical care to members, which could include medical or ancillary costs like dental, vision and other supplemental health benefits. such capitation costs are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates. other medical care costs include all medically-related administrative costs, amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements, provider claims, and other healthcare expenses. examples of medically-related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education, quality assurance, case management, care coordination, disease management, and 24-hour on-call nurses. additionally, we include an estimate for the cost of settling claims incurred through the reporting date in our medical claims and benefits payable liability.
the following table illustrates consolidated medical care costs by type for the periods indicated:

medical claims and benefits payable consist mainly of fee-for-service ibnp, unpaid pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other medical costs, including amounts payable to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements and amounts payable to providers on behalf of certain state agencies for certain state assessments in which we assume no financial risk. ibnp includes the costs of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date which have been reported to us, and our best estimate of the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us. when more complete claims payment information and healthcare cost trend data becomes available, we reflect changes in these estimates as an increase or decrease to medical care costs in the consolidated results of operations in the period in which they are determined.

membership, product mix, seasonality, benefit changes or changes in fee schedules, provider contract changes, prior authorizations and the incidence of catastrophic or pandemic cases.
for claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date, we mainly use estimated completion factors to estimate the ultimate cost of those claims. completion factors measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical claims payment patterns. we analyze historical claims payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates to claim payment dates to estimate completion factors. the estimated completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claims cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. the difference between the estimated ultimate claims cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents our estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in our ibnp liability.
for claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date, actual claims paid are a less reliable measure of our ultimate cost since a large portion of medical claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been submitted. accordingly, we estimate our ibnp liability for claims incurred during these months based on a blend of estimated completion factors and assumed medical care cost trend. the assumed medical care cost trend represents the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs, which can be affected by many factors including, but not limited to, our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, changes in member demographics, catastrophes and epidemics, and other relevant factors.
actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that our overall best estimate of the ibnp liability has a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, where the liability is sufficient to account for moderately adverse conditions. accordingly, our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate including a provision for moderately adverse conditions for each current period. this provision is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: current year" in the table presented in note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable." adverse conditions are situations that may cause actual claims to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate, such as changes in the magnitude or severity of claims, uncertainties related to our entry into new geographical markets or provision of services to new populations, changes in state-controlled fee schedules, and modifications or upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices. therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice.
when subsequent actual claims payments are less than we estimated, we recognize a benefit for favorable prior period development that is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: prior years" in the table presented in note 10. assuming stability in the size of our membership, the use of this consistent methodology, during any given period, usually results in the replenishment of reserves at a level that generally offsets the benefit of favorable prior period development in that period. in the case of material growth or decline of membership, replenishment can exceed or fall short of the favorable development, assuming all other factors remain unchanged.
because of the significant degree of judgment involved in estimation of our ibnp liability, there is considerable variability and uncertainty inherent in such estimates. the following table reflects the hypothetical change in our estimate of claims liability as of december 31, 2023 that would result if we change our completion factors for the fourth through the twelfth months preceding december 31, 2023, by the percentages indicated. a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities. dollar amounts are in millions.

there are many related factors working in conjunction with one another that determine the accuracy of our estimates, some of which are qualitative in nature rather than quantitative. therefore, we are seldom able to quantify the impact that any single factor has on a change in estimate. given the variability inherent in the reserving process, we will only be able to identify specific factors if they represent a significant departure from expectations. as a result, we do not expect to be able to fully quantify the impact of individual factors on changes in estimates.

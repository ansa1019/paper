item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our base business calculations, see the results of operations section below.
2023 financial overview financial results following a period of significant growth over the prior three years, net sales decreased 10% to $5.5 billion in 2023 compared to $6.2 billion in 2022, resulting in a compound annual growth rate (cagr) of 15% from 2019 to 2023. base business results approximated consolidated results for 2023. our net sales benefited approximately 3% to 4% from inflationary product cost increases in 2023 versus a benefit of 10% in 2022. unfavorable weather conditions in certain markets throughout the first half of the year resulted in a slow start to the swimming pool season and slower maintenance activity than anticipated, limiting sales in the first and second quarters. our results were also impacted by lower volumes of discretionary pool products sold due to reduced pool construction activity and discretionary replacement activity.
gross profit was $1.7 billion in 2023, a 14% decrease from gross profit of $1.9 billion in 2022. our gross profit increased at a 16% cagr from 2019 to 2023. gross margin declined 130 basis points to 30.0% in 2023 compared to 31.3% in 2022. our 2023 gross margin is in line with our longer-term annual gross margin outlook, while our prior year gross margin benefited from higher levels of inflation and price increases.
selling and administrative expenses (operating expenses) increased 0.6%, or $5.8 million, to $913.5 million in 2023. as a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased 180 basis points to 16.5% in 2023 compared to 14.7% in 2022. during 2023, volume-driven expenses were managed in line with lower sales, and our largest expense growth drivers related to inflationary wage increases, rent and facility costs and insurance and healthcare-related costs.
operating income for the year decreased 27% to $746.6 million, down from $1.0 billion in 2022. our operating income increased at a 22% cagr from 2019 to 2023. operating margin decreased 310 basis points to 13.5% in 2023 compared to 16.6% in 2022.
interest and other non-operating expenses, net for the year increased $17.5 million compared to 2022, as higher average interest rates more than offset a decrease in average debt.
we recorded a $6.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, tax benefit from accounting standards update (asu) 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to a tax benefit of $10.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, realized in 2022.
net income declined 30% to $523.2 million in 2023 compared to $748.5 million in 2022. earnings per share decreased 29% to $13.35 per diluted share compared to a record of $18.70 per diluted share in 2022. without the impact from asu 2016-09 in both periods, earnings per diluted share decreased 28% to $13.18 per diluted share compared to $18.43 per diluted share in 2022. from 2019 to 2023, our earnings per diluted share increased by a 20% cagr and a 23% cagr without the impact from asu 2016-19. see results of operations below for definitions of our non-gaap measures and reconciliations of our non-gaap measures to gaap measures.
financial position and liquidity cash provided by operations was $888.2 million in 2023, which funded the following initiatives:
•a $333.5 million debt reduction
•share repurchases, totaling $306.4 million for the year;
•quarterly cash dividend payments to shareholders, totaling $167.5 million for the year; and
•net capital expenditures and acquisitions of $71.6 million.
total net receivables, including pledged receivables, decreased 2% compared to december 31, 2022, primarily due to lower sales in 2023. our allowance for doubtful accounts was $11.7 million at december 31, 2023 and $9.5 million at december 31, 2022. our days sales outstanding ratio, as calculated on a trailing four quarters basis, was 26.8 days at december 31, 2023 and 26.9 days at december 31, 2022.
inventory levels decreased 14% to $1.4 billion, compared to $1.6 billion at december 31, 2022, consistent with our inventory reduction goals and partially offset by increases from early buy vendor deals that we took advantage of in the last quarter of the year. our reserve for inventory obsolescence was $23.5 million at december 31, 2023 compared to $21.2 million at december 31, 2022. our inventory turns, as calculated on a trailing four quarters basis, were 2.7 times at december 31, 2023 and 2.6 times at december 31, 2022.
total debt outstanding of $1.1 billion at december 31, 2023 decreased $333.5 million compared to december 31, 2022 as we have used operating cash flows to reduce our debt.
current trends and outlook over the past decade, consumers' investments in their homes, including backyard renovations, have flourished. in recent years, steady increases in home values, lack of affordable new homes and increased mortgage rates have prompted homeowners to stay in their homes longer and upgrade their home environments, including their backyards. many families have spent more time at home and sought opportunities to create or expand home-based outdoor living and entertainment spaces. these outdoor investment trends, which were particularly heightened during 2020 through 2022, resulted in an increase in new pool construction and greater expenditures for maintenance and remodeling products. in 2023, we estimate that new in-ground pool construction units decreased 23% to approximately 75,000 units from 98,000 units in 2022 as new construction activities declined following significant growth in 2021 and 2020. our estimate of the new in-ground pool units added in 2023 is consistent with the 78,000 pools added in 2019. we expect that consumers will continue to invest in outdoor living spaces as they consider backyards an extension of their home space. we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the inherent long-term growth opportunities in our industry fueled by favorable population migration trends, strong housing demand dynamics and product developments and technological advancements as consumers focus on more environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient products.
market conditions in 2023 were challenged by overall affordability concerns, including higher interest rates and product cost and labor inflation, which led to consumer hesitancy and some cyclical suppression of demand. while these market conditions impacted new pool construction and remodeling projects, our non-discretionary maintenance product sales in 2023 were not significantly impacted.
in view of current trends, we established our outlook for 2024 based on reasonable expectations for industry demand, pricing and inflationary conditions, focused expense management, increased investment in our digital transformation initiatives and ongoing leverage of existing investments in our business and continuous process improvements. we also plan to broaden our geographic presence by opening about 10 or more new sales centers in 2024 and by making selective acquisitions when appropriate opportunities arise.
we base our assumptions on normal weather conditions and do not incorporate alternative weather predictions into our guidance.  favorable weather positively impacts industry activity by accelerating growth in any given year, expanding the number of available construction days, extending the pool season and pool usage and positively impacting demand for discretionary products. conversely, unfavorable weather typically impedes growth.
the following summarizes our outlook for 2024:
•we expect sales to be flat to a low single digit increase compared to 2023, impacted by the following factors and assumptions:
◦normal weather patterns for 2024;
◦sustained demand for pool maintenance products;
◦volumes of discretionary products used for swimming pool construction to be flat to down 10%;
◦volumes of products used in the remodeling, renovation and upgrading of swimming pools to be flat to down 10%;
◦inflationary product cost increases, which generally pass through to customers of approximately 2% to 3%; and
◦a 1% benefit from expansion of the installed base of in-ground swimming pools.
•we project gross margin for the full year of 2024 to be around 30.0%, with our highest margin in the second quarter of the year. our actual gross margin will depend on amounts and timing of inflationary price increases, sales and product mix.
•we expect to leverage our existing infrastructure and manage discretionary spending to maintain expenses in line with sales expectations to achieve operating margin of approximately 13.0%.
in 2024, we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 25.3% without the impact of asu 2016-09. our effective tax rate is dependent upon our results of operations and may change if actual results are different from our current expectations. due to asu 2016-09 requirements, we expect our effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, particularly in periods when employees elect to exercise their vested stock options or when restrictions on share-based awards lapse. we estimate that we have approximately $3.8 million in unrealized excess tax benefits related to stock options that expire and restricted awards that vest in the first quarter of 2024. we may recognize additional tax benefits related to stock option exercises in 2024 from grants that expire in years after 2024, for which we have not included any expected benefits in our guidance. the estimated impact related to asu 2016-09 is subject to several assumptions which can vary significantly, including our estimated share price and the period that our employees will exercise vested stock options. we recorded a $6.7 million benefit in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2023 related to asu 2016-09.
we project that 2024 earnings will be in the range of $13.10 to $14.10 per diluted share, including an estimated $0.10 benefit from asu 2016-09 during the first quarter of 2024. we expect to continue to use cash for the payment of cash dividends as and when declared by our board and to fund opportunistic share repurchases over the next year.
the forward-looking statements in this current trends and outlook section and elsewhere in this document are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions; changes in the economy, consumer discretionary spending, the housing market, interest or inflation rates; our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers; the extent to which home-centric trends experienced during the height of the pandemic will moderate or reverse; competition from other leisure product alternatives or mass merchants; our ability to continue to execute our growth strategies; changes in the regulatory environment; new or additional taxes, duties or tariffs; excess tax benefits or deficiencies recognized under asu 2016-09 and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10-k. also see "cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995" prior to the heading "risk factors" in item 1a.
covid-19 pandemic and other economic trends beginning in the second quarter of 2020 during the covid-19 pandemic, we experienced unprecedented demand as families spent more time at home and sought opportunities to create or expand home-based outdoor living and entertainment spaces. this trend had a positive impact on our financial performance during 2020 through 2022. in the latter half of 2022 and throughout 2023, these trends moderated resulting in a lower number of permits issued for new pools and lagging new pool construction activities. we expect these trends to continue in 2024.
our industry also experienced substantial supply chain constraints beginning in 2021. in response, we proactively made significant investments in inventory in the last half of 2021 and early 2022 that enabled us to continue to meet strong customer demand and position ourselves to provide exceptional customer service. while we continued to be challenged by supply chain constraints through early 2022, supply chain dynamics improved beginning in the second quarter of 2022. in 2023, our inventory balances normalized with seasonal trends resulting in a 14% decrease compared to 2022.
critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board. our critical accounting estimates are discussed below, including, to the extent material and reasonably available, the impact such estimates have had, or are reasonably likely to have, on our financial condition or results of operations.
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments. we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral. consistent with industry practices, we generally require payment from our north american customers within 30 days, except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers. the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april, may and june or may and june, depending on geographic location. credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations.
similar to our business, our customers' businesses are seasonal. sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time. we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on our accounts receivable aging. these reserves range from 0.05% for amounts currently due to up to 100% for specific accounts more than 60 days past due.
at the end of each quarter, we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than $20,000 and more than 60 days past due. additionally, we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on past due accounts. we estimate future losses based upon historical bad debts, customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, customers' financial conditions and current and forecasted economic trends, including certain trends in the housing market, the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions (as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp). we monitor housing market trends through review of the house price index as published by the federal housing finance agency, which measures the movement of single-family home prices.
during the year, we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. these write-offs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts. in the past five years, write-offs have averaged approximately 0.09% of net sales annually.  write-offs as a percentage of net sales approximated 0.12% in 2023, 0.08% in 2022 and 0.06% in 2021. we expect that write-offs will range from 0.05% to 0.10% of net sales in 2024.
at the end of each fiscal year, we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior year-end allowance for doubtful accounts balance to (i) current year write-offs and (ii) any significantly aged outstanding receivable balances. based on our most recent hindsight analysis, we concluded that the prior year allowance was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate.
if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20% at december 31, 2023, pretax income would change by approximately $2.3 million and earnings per share would change by approximately $0.04 per diluted share (based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31, 2023).
inventory obsolescence product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet. our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stock-outs to provide the highest level of service to our customers. to do this, we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units (skus) with the highest sales volumes. at the same time, we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory, which are not as critical to our customers and thus, inherently turn at slower rates.
we classify products at the sales center level based on sales at each location over the expected sellable period, which is the previous 12 months for most products, except for special order non-stock items that lack a sku in our system and products with less than 12 months of usage. below is a description of these inventory classifications:
•new products with less than 12 months usage;
•highest sales velocity items, which represent approximately 80% of net sales at the sales center;
•lower sales velocity items, which we keep in stock to provide a high level of customer service;
•products with no sales for the past 12 months at the local sales center level, excluding special order products not yet delivered to the customer; and
•non-stock special order items.
there is little risk of obsolescence for our highest sales velocity items because these products generally turn quickly. we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory with lower sales velocity and inventory with no sales for the past 12 months, which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence, with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months. the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory at net realizable value. we evaluate a potential reserve for 5% for inventory with lower sales velocity, inventory with no sales for the past 12 months and non-stock inventory as determined at the sales center level. we also consider an additional 5% reserve for excess lower sales velocity inventory and an additional 45% reserve for excess inventory with no sales for the past 12 months. we determine excess inventory, which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months' usage, on a company-wide basis. we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of total inventory with no sales for the past 12 months. we record reserves as necessary based on our evaluations. we have not changed our methodology from prior years.
in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence, we consider a combination of factors, including:
•the level of inventory in relation to historical sales by product, including inventory usage by class based on product sales at both the sales center level and on a company-wide basis;
•changes in customer preferences or regulatory requirements;
•seasonal fluctuations in inventory levels;
•geographic location; and
•superseded products and new product offerings.
we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the above-identified factors. at the end of each fiscal year, we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior year-end obsolescence reserve balance to (i) current year inventory write-offs and (ii) the value of products with no sales for the past 12 months that remain in inventory. based on our most recent hindsight analysis, we concluded that our prior year reserve was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate.
if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20% at december 31, 2023, pretax income would change by approximately $4.7 million and earnings per share would change by approximately $0.09 per diluted share (based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31, 2023).
vendor programs many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures.  these measures generally relate to the volume level of purchases from our vendors, or our net cost of products sold, and may include negotiated pricing arrangements.  we account for vendor programs as a reduction of the prices of the vendor's products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product, at which time we recognize such consideration as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement.
throughout the year, we estimate the amount earned based on our expectation of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward the attainment of various levels within certain vendor programs. we accrue vendor program benefits on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable. our estimates for annual purchases, future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections, which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including changes in economic conditions and weather.  changes in our purchasing mix also impact our estimates, as certain program rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors.
we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends. as a result, our estimated quarterly vendor program benefits accrual may include cumulative catch-up adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods. these adjustments have a greater impact on gross margin in the fourth quarter since it is our seasonally slowest quarter and because the majority of our vendor arrangements are based on calendar year periods. we update our estimates for these arrangements at year end to reflect actual annual purchase or sales levels. in the first quarter of the subsequent year, we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing actual vendor credits received to the prior year vendor receivable balances. based on our most recent hindsight analysis, we concluded that our vendor program estimates were within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate.
if market conditions were to change, vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs. although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased, they may lower or raise our cost for products purchased and sold in future periods.
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse.  due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates, significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future.
we record global intangible low tax income (gilti) on foreign earnings as period costs if and when incurred, although we have not realized any impacts since the december 2017 enactment of u.s. tax reform.
as of december 31, 2023, u.s. income taxes were not provided on the earnings or cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries, outside of the provisions of the transition tax from u.s. tax reform. as we have historically invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely to fund current cash flow needs in the countries where held, additional income tax provisions may be required. determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings and cash balances is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances, tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation.
we operate in 41 states, 1 united states territory and 11 foreign countries. we are subject to regular audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities.  we recognize a benefit from an uncertain tax position only after determining it is more likely than not that the tax position will withstand examination by the applicable taxing authority. our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. we regularly evaluate our tax positions and incorporate these expectations into our reserve estimates. we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters.  however, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire.  these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established.  as a result of these uncertainties, our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis.
each year, we prepare a return to provision analysis upon filing our income tax returns. based on our most recent hindsight analysis, we concluded that our prior year income tax provision was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our provision calculation methodology is appropriate. differences between our effective income tax rate and federal and state statutory tax rates are primarily due to excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of deductible nonqualified stock options and the lapse of restrictions on deductible restricted stock awards.
performance-based compensation accrual the compensation committee of our board (compensation committee) and our management have designed compensation programs intended to create a performance culture. the primary objectives of our compensation programs are to attract, motivate, reward and retain our employees without leading to unnecessary risk taking. our compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to groups of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility. the majority of our bonus plans consist of annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria. we calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results, including operating income.
we use an annual cash performance award (annual bonus) to focus corporate behavior on short-term goals for growth, financial performance and other specific financial and business improvement metrics. management sets the company's annual bonus objectives at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year. management also establishes specific business improvement objectives for both our operating units and corporate employees. the compensation committee approves objectives for annual bonus plans involving executive management.
we have also utilized our medium-term (three-year) strategic plan incentive program (spip) to provide senior management with an additional cash-based, pay-for-performance award based on the achievement of specified earnings growth objectives. payouts through the spip are based on three-year compound annual growth rates (cagrs) of our diluted eps. beginning in 2023, our compensation committee did not grant any awards under the spip. outstanding awards will pay out in 2024 and 2025 if the applicable three-year performance conditions are achieved.
we record annual performance-based compensation accruals based on operating income achieved in a quarter as a percentage of total expected operating income for the year. we estimate total expected operating income for the current plan year using management's estimate of the total overall incentives earned per the stated bonus plan objectives. starting in june, and continuing each quarter through our fiscal year end, we adjust our estimated performance-based compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan, the participants' progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management's estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans, if any.
we record spip accruals based on our total expected eps for the current fiscal year and earnings growth estimates for the succeeding two years. we base our current fiscal year estimates on the same assumptions used for our annual bonus calculation.
our quarterly performance-based compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following differences between estimated and actual performance and the discretionary components of the bonus plans.
we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year. each year, we compare the actual bonus payouts to amounts accrued at the previous year's end to determine the accuracy of our performance-based compensation estimates. based on our most recent hindsight analysis, we concluded that our performance-based compensation accrual balances were within a reasonable range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodologies are appropriate.
impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill is our largest intangible asset. at december 31, 2023, our goodwill balance was $700.1 million, representing approximately 20% of total assets. goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed.
we perform a goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment.  the fair value estimates used in our impairment test is determined using discounted cash flow models, which require the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a level 3 fair value measurement. to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we project company-wide future cash flows using management's assumptions for sales growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and earnings multiples. the earnings multiples are then used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. these estimates can significantly affect the outcome of our impairment test. we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends, current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate. to the extent the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its estimated fair value, we perform a discounted cash flow analysis at the reporting unit level to further evaluate our initial fair value estimate. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, we record a goodwill impairment charge for the difference, up to the carrying value of the goodwill. since we define an operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level, we define a reporting unit as an individual sales center.
to test the reasonableness of our fair value estimates, we compared our aggregate estimated fair values to our market capitalization as of the date of our annual impairment test. in 2023, our aggregate estimated fair values were in line with our market capitalization. to facilitate a sensitivity analysis, we reduced our consolidated fair value estimate to reflect more conservative discounted cash flow assumptions, the sensitivity of a 150 basis point increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital or a 50 basis point decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate. our sensitivity analysis resulted in a fair value modestly lower than our market capitalization and did not result in the identification of additional at-risk locations.
if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if operating results are less than forecasted, we could incur impairment charges in future periods.  impairment charges would decrease operating income, negatively impact diluted eps and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.
in september 2023, we recorded goodwill impairment of $0.6 million, primarily related to one of our horizon reporting units in texas that we previously identified as being most at risk of goodwill impairment. we had been monitoring this location's results, which came in below expectations at the end of the 2023 season. we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis, which included a discounted cash flow analysis, and determined that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit no longer exceeded its carrying value.
in october 2023, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not record any additional goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. as of october 1, 2023, we had 250 reporting units with allocated goodwill balances. our most significant goodwill balance of $403.5 million was related to our porpoise pool & patio reporting unit and the next largest goodwill balance for a reporting unit was $12.1 million. the average goodwill balance per reporting unit was $2.8 million.
in october 2022, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded goodwill impairment of $0.6 million related to the closure of a horizon reporting unit in that period. in october 2021, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not recognize any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level.

fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022
base business we calculate base business results by excluding, for a period of 15 months, sales centers that we acquire, open in new markets or close. we also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that we consolidate with acquired sales centers.
we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales. after 15 months, we include acquired, consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period.
we have not provided separate base business income statements within this form 10-k as base business results approximated consolidated results, and acquisitions and sales centers excluded from base business contributed less than 1% to the change in net sales.
the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2023:

new locations              14

net sales
(in millions)                                            year ended december 31,
2023                        2022                              change net sales                        $5,541.6                          $6,179.7        $(638.1)                  (10)%
following sales growth of 17% in 2022, 35% in 2021 and 23% in 2020 (all compared to the prior year periods), our net sales in 2023 declined 10% compared to 2022. our base business results approximated our consolidated results for the year. at the core of our business, maintenance activities remained stable throughout the year, indicating steady demand for non-discretionary products. unfavorable weather conditions in certain markets throughout the first half of the year led to a slow start to the swimming pool season, which limited sales in the first and second quarters. our results also reflected lower sales volumes from reduced pool construction activity and discretionary replacement activity as tough macroeconomic conditions strained major project consumer spending.
the following factors also impacted our sales during the year and are listed in order of estimated magnitude.
•net sales benefited approximately 3% to 4% from inflationary product cost increases (compared to a 10% benefit in 2022), net of price deflation for some products including chemical sanitizers, pvc pipe and rebar.
•we estimate that unfavorable weather conditions, primarily in the first half of the year, negatively impacted sales by approximately 2%.
•sales were negatively impacted 1% from lower customer early buy activity in 2023 versus 2022.
related to our product sales, following a period of significant growth over the past three years, we observed a decline in volumes of discretionary products sold, largely due to lagging new pool construction activities. in 2023, sales of equipment, which includes swimming pool heaters, pumps, lights, filters and automation, decreased approximately 9% compared to 2022 and represented approximately 29% of net sales. sales of building materials fell 9% compared to 2022 and represented approximately 13% of net sales in 2023.
sales to specialty retailers that sell swimming pool supplies and customers who service large commercial installations are included in the appropriate existing product categories, and growth in these areas is reflected in the discussion above. in 2023, sales to retail customers decreased 10% compared to 2022 and represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net sales. unfavorable weather and supply normalization affected our sales to independent retail customers in the first half of 2023. encouragingly, we saw sales trends improve through the last half of the year. as consumers take advantage of travel opportunities, sales to commercial customers increased 9% compared to 2022 and represented approximately 4% of our consolidated net sales in 2023.

•in the first quarter of 2023, unfavorable weather in our western markets, offset generally favorable weather in our southern markets. on an aggregate basis, we estimate that unfavorable weather conditions in the first quarter negatively impacted sales by approximately 5%. sales were also negatively impacted 2% from lower customer early buy activity in the first quarter of 2023 and 1% from continued softness in our european markets.
•a slow start to the swimming pool season combined with cautious consumer sentiment led to slower maintenance activity than anticipated, reduced outdoor living construction activity and deferred discretionary replacement activity in the second quarter of 2023. sales were also negatively impacted 1% from both unfavorable weather conditions and lower customer early buy activity in the second quarter of 2023.
•during the third quarter of 2023, maintenance activities remained stable, while pool construction-related activities remained weaker as challenging macroeconomic conditions continued to weigh heavily on major project consumer spending. our results were also negatively impacted 1% from one less selling day in the third quarter of 2023 versus the third quarter of 2022.
•in the fourth quarter of 2023, maintenance activities and demand for non-discretionary products were stable. lower sales during our seasonally slowest time of year were largely attributable to softer spending trends for discretionary products due to reduced pool construction activity and discretionary replacement activity.

gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 30.0% in 2023 compared to 31.3% in 2022. our prior year gross margin benefited from our strategic inventory buys when we purchased product ahead of vendor price increases. as our sales benefited from higher inflation, we were able to sell those products at a lower average cost to our sales price. our gross margin in 2023 was in line with our long-term expectations. throughout the year, our gross margin was impacted by a variety of factors, including a less advantageous product and customer mix and a more competitive pricing environment as a result of slower activity within the outdoor living industry.
operating expenses
(in millions)                                                                         year ended december 31,

operating expenses increased 0.6%, or $5.8 million, to $913.5 million in 2023, up from $907.6 million in 2022. during 2023, volume-driven expenses were managed in line with lower sales resulting in a decline in variable and discretionary expenses (including performance-based compensation, temporary and overtime labor) and reduced delivery and vehicle operating costs compared to last year. our largest expense growth drivers related to inflationary wage increases, rent and facility costs and insurance and healthcare-related costs, the return of in-person customer-facing retail events and investments in new locations and customer-focused projects.
interest and other non-operating expenses, net interest and other non-operating expenses, net increased $17.5 million compared to 2022, as higher average interest rates more than offset a decrease in average debt. our weighted average effective interest rate increased to 5.2% in 2023 from 2.8% in 2022 on average outstanding debt of $1.1 billion in 2023 versus $1.4 billion in 2022.
income taxes our effective income tax rate was 24.0% at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022. we recorded a $6.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, benefit from asu 2016-09 for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to a benefit of $10.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, realized in 2022. without the benefits from asu 2016-09, our effective tax rate was 25.0% for the year ended 2023 and 25.1% for the year ended 2022.
net income and earnings per share net income decreased 30% to $523.2 million in 2023 compared to $748.5 million in 2022. earnings per share decreased 29% to $13.35 per diluted share compared to $18.70 per diluted share in 2022.
reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures the non-gaap measures described below should be considered in the context of all of our other disclosures in this form 10-k.
adjusted diluted eps we have included adjusted diluted eps, a non-gaap financial measure, as a supplemental disclosure, because we believe this measure is useful to management, investors and others in assessing our year-over-year operating performance.
adjusted diluted eps is a key measure used by management to demonstrate the impact of tax benefits from asu 2016-09 on our diluted eps and to provide investors and others with additional information about our potential future operating performance to supplement gaap measures.
we believe this measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, diluted eps presented in accordance with gaap, and in the context of our other disclosures. other companies may calculate this non-gaap financial measure differently than we do, which may limit their usefulness as a comparative measure.

weather impacts on fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2022 comparisons weather conditions varied across the contiguous united states throughout the first quarter of 2023. conditions were generally favorable in our southern markets, where sales benefited from warmer weather and below-average precipitation. in contrast, results were unfavorably impacted by unusually wet and cold weather in the western u.s., particularly in california and arizona, which are two of our largest markets. overall, we estimate that unfavorable weather conditions in the first quarter of 2023 negatively impacted first quarter sales by approximately 5%. comparatively, in the first quarter of 2022, overall weather conditions were generally favorable, and sales benefited from above-average temperatures along much of the west and the east coast, although texas experienced cooler-than-normal temperatures.
overall, weather conditions unfavorably impacted sales by an estimated $30.0 million in the second quarter of 2023, particularly at the beginning of the second quarter. the first week of april through easter weekend was much cooler across the west versus both average temperatures and prior year temperatures. the last week of april was also significantly cooler than normal from texas through the mid-atlantic region, excluding the coastal southeast. while the northeast had warmer than average weather the first few weeks of april, temperatures cooled dramatically through the first week of may and smoke from wildfires in canada unfavorably impacted sales in early june. weather in florida was more normal and consistent with prior year, while favorable weather conditions compared to the second quarter of 2022 were limited to the pacific northwest and europe. similarly, sales growth in the second quarter of 2022 was challenged by unfavorable weather conditions in our seasonal markets and europe; however, our southern markets benefited from above-average temperatures, particularly in texas.
weather conditions in the third quarter of 2023 were fairly neutral as hot temperatures across the southern united states were offset by rainy conditions in the northeast. comparatively, sales in the third quarter of 2022 were generally aided by above-average temperatures throughout much of the contiguous united states, although florida saw a decline in sales due to closures resulting from hurricane ian towards the end of the quarter.
overall, weather conditions were warm in the fourth quarter of 2023 and did not have a major impact on sales. the month of december marked the warmest temperatures recorded in 129 years, while the months of october and november saw below average rainfall across most of the united states. conversely, fourth quarter of 2022 had less favorable conditions. in december, an arctic front brought freezing temperatures and above-average temperatures across the united states and canada.

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet short-term and long-term cash needs. we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities, taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business. significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following:
•cash flows generated from operating activities;
•the adequacy of available bank lines of credit;
•the quality of our receivables;
•acquisitions;
•dividend payments;
•capital expenditures;
•changes in income tax laws and regulations;
•the timing and extent of share repurchases; and
•the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.
our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations, debt repayment obligations and other general corporate initiatives, including acquisitions, opening new sales centers, dividend payments and share repurchases. our primary working capital obligations are for the purchase of inventory, payroll, rent, other facility costs and selling and administrative expenses. our working capital obligations fluctuate during the year, driven primarily by seasonality and the timing of inventory purchases. our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings, which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions. we have funded our capital expenditures and share repurchases in substantially the same manner.
we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business, maintaining a prudent capital structure, including a modest amount of debt, and returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows:
•capital expenditures primarily for maintenance and growth of our sales center network, technology-related investments and fleet vehicles;
•inventory and other operating expenses;
•strategic acquisitions executed opportunistically;
•payment of cash dividends as and when declared by our board;
•repayment of debt to maintain an average total target leverage ratio (as defined below) between 1.5 and 2.0; and
•discretionary repurchases of our common stock under our board authorized share repurchase program.
our capital spending primarily relates to leasehold improvements, delivery and service vehicles and information technology. we focus our capital expenditure plans based on the needs of our sales centers. in recent years, we have increased our investment in technology and automation enabling us to operate more efficiently and better serve our customers.
historically, our capital expenditures have averaged roughly 1.0% of net sales. capital expenditures were 1.1% of net sales in 2023 and 0.7% of net sales in 2022 and 2021. in 2022 and 2021, our capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales were lower than our historical average due to our significant sales growth in those years. based on management's current plans, we project capital expenditures for 2024 will average 1% to 1.5% of net sales.
we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise.  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates. if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing, we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions.
as of february 20, 2024, $344.1 million of the current board authorized amount under our authorized share repurchase plan remained available. we expect to repurchase additional shares in the open market from time to time depending on market conditions. we plan to fund these repurchases with cash provided by operations and borrowings under our credit and receivables facilities.
sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes our cash flows (in thousands):
year ended december 31,
2023                        2022
operating activities                   $888,229                          $484,854
investing activities                   (71,597)                          (50,870)
financing activities                  (798,132)                         (411,658)
cash provided by operations of $888.2 million for 2023 increased $403.4 million compared to 2022, primarily driven by positive changes in working capital, particularly as we sold through our prior year strategic inventory purchases, partially offset by lower net income.
cash used in investing activities increased $20.7 million to $71.6 million in 2023, reflecting a $16.5 million increase in net capital expenditures between years and an increase of $2.3 million in payments for acquisitions compared to 2022.
cash used in financing activities increased to $798.1 million in 2023 compared to $411.7 million in 2022. the change in financing activities primarily reflects a $537.0 million increase in net debt payments and a $16.8 million increase in dividends paid, partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases of $164.9 million.
for a discussion of our sources and uses of cash in 2021, see the liquidity and capital resources - sources and uses of cash section of management's discussion and analysis included in part ii, item 7 of our 2022 annual report on form 10-k.
future sources and uses of cash to supplement cash from operations as our primary source of working capital, we will continue to utilize our three major credit facilities, which are the amended and restated revolving credit facility (the credit facility), the term facility (the term facility) and the receivables securitization facility (the receivables facility). for additional details regarding these facilities, see the summary descriptions below and more complete descriptions in note 5 of our "notes to consolidated financial statements," included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
credit facility our credit facility provides for $1.25 billion in borrowing capacity consisting of a $750.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility and a $500.0 million term loan facility. the credit facility also includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit. we pay interest on revolving and term loan borrowings under the credit facility at a variable rate based on one-month term sofr, plus an applicable margin. the term loan requires quarterly amortization payments during the third, fourth and fifth years of the loan, beginning in september 2023 aggregating to 20% of the original principal amount of the loan, with all remaining principal due on the credit facility maturity date of september 25, 2026. we intend to continue to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes, for future share repurchases and to fund future growth initiatives.
at december 31, 2023, there was $740.0 million outstanding, including a $487.5 million term loan, with a $16.0 million standby letter of credit outstanding and $481.5 million available for borrowing under the credit facility. the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december 31, 2023 was approximately 4.7%, excluding commitment fees and including the impact of our interest rate swaps.
term facility our term facility provides for $185.0 million in borrowing capacity and matures on december 30, 2026. proceeds from the term facility were used to pay down the credit facility in december 2019, adding borrowing capacity for future share repurchases, acquisitions and growth-oriented working capital expansion. we pay interest on borrowings under the term facility at a variable rate based on one month term sofr, plus an applicable margin. the term facility is repaid in quarterly installments of 1.250% of the term facility on the last business day of each quarter beginning in the first quarter of 2020. we may prepay amounts outstanding under the term facility without penalty other than interest breakage costs. in june 2023, we made a prepayment on the term facility of $45.0 million with $32.4 million applied against the remaining quarterly installments and the remainder applied against the amount due at maturity.
at december 31, 2023, the term facility had an outstanding balance of $109.9 million at a weighted average effective interest rate of 6.6%.
receivables securitization facility our two-year accounts receivable securitization facility (the receivables facility) offers us a lower-cost form of financing. under this facility, we can borrow up to $350.0 million between april through august and from $210.0 million to $340.0 million during the remaining months of the year. we pay interest on borrowings under the receivables facility at a variable rate based on one month term sofr, plus an applicable margin. the receivables facility matures on november 1, 2024.
the receivables facility provides for the sale of certain of our receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary (the securitization subsidiary). the securitization subsidiary transfers variable undivided percentage interests in the receivables and related rights to certain third-party financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds, limited to the applicable funding capacities. upon payment of the receivables by customers, rather than remitting to the financial institutions the amounts collected, we retain such collections as proceeds for the sale of new receivables until payments become due.
at december 31, 2023, there was $191.7 million outstanding under the receivables facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 6.2%, excluding commitment fees.
financial covenants financial covenants of the credit facility, term facility and receivables facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which are our most restrictive financial covenants.  as of december 31, 2023, the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below:
•maximum average total leverage ratio. on the last day of each fiscal quarter, our average total leverage ratio must be less than 3.25 to 1.00.  average total leverage ratio is the ratio of the sum of (i) total non-revolving funded indebtedness as of such date, (ii) the trailing twelve months (ttm) average total revolving funded indebtedness and (iii) the ttm average accounts securitization proceeds divided by ttm ebitda (as those terms are defined in the credit facility).  as of december 31, 2023, our average total leverage ratio equaled 1.39 (compared to 1.37 as of december 31, 2022) and the ttm average total indebtedness amount used in this calculation was $1.1 billion.
•minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. on the last day of each fiscal quarter, our fixed charge ratio must be greater than or equal to 2.25 to 1.00. fixed charge ratio is the ratio of the ttm ebitdar divided by ttm interest expense paid or payable in cash plus ttm rental expense (as those terms are defined in the credit facility).  as of december 31, 2023, our fixed charge ratio equaled 5.94 (compared to 9.57 as of december 31, 2022) and ttm rental expense was $92.0 million.
the credit facility and term facility limit the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to a manner consistent with past practice, provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, or would result from the payment of dividends. we may declare and pay quarterly dividends so long as (i) the amount per share of such dividends is not greater than the most recently publicly announced dividends per share and (ii) our average total leverage ratio is less than 3.25 to 1.00 both immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to such dividends. under the credit facility and term facility, we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, or would result from the repurchase of shares, and our maximum average total leverage ratio (determined on a pro forma basis) is less than 3.25 to 1.00.
other covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, merge or consolidate, and sell or transfer assets. failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the credit facility and the term facility could result in higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt.
interest rate swaps we utilize interest rate swap contracts and forward-starting interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest payments on our variable rate borrowings. interest expense related to the notional amounts under all swap contracts is based on applicable fixed rates plus the applicable margin on the respective borrowings.
as of december 31, 2023, we had two interest rate swap contracts in place and one forward-starting interest rate swap contract, each of which has the effect of converting our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our variable rate borrowings to fixed interest rates. for more information, see note 5 of "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
compliance and future availability as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements under our credit facility, our term facility and our receivables facility.  we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2024.  for additional information regarding our debt arrangements, see note 5 of "notes to consolidated financial statements," included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
future obligations we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. changes in our business needs, fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from our estimates. we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31, 2023 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash, cash expected to be generated from operations and borrowings on our facilities.
payments due by period total           less than                       1-3 years               3-5 years                     more than

the significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:
•long-term debt amounts represent the future principal payments on our debt as of december 31, 2023. our receivables facility matures november 1, 2024 and is included in the table above according to its stated maturity date. on our consolidated balance sheets, we classify the entire outstanding balance of the receivables facility as long-term debt as we intend and have the ability to refinance the obligations on a long-term basis. for additional information regarding our debt arrangements, see note 5 of our "notes to consolidated financial statements," included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
•operating lease amounts include future rental payments for our operating leases. the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases. for additional information regarding our operating leases, see note 9 of our "notes to consolidated financial statements," included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
•purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases and software commitments. we issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancellable by their terms. we do not consider our cancellable purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above.
for certain of our future obligations, such as unrecognized tax benefits, uncertainties exist regarding the timing of future payments and the amount by which these potential obligations will increase or decrease over time. as such, we have excluded unrecognized tax benefits from the table above. see note 7 of "notes to consolidated financial statements," included in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional discussion related to our unrecognized tax benefits. the table also excludes various other liabilities that are not contractual in nature, including contingent liabilities, litigation accruals and contract termination fees.
the table below contains estimated interest payments (in thousands) related to our long-term debt obligations presented in the table above.  we calculated estimates of future interest payments based on the december 31, 2023 outstanding debt balances, using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates as of december 31, 2023 for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swap contracts.  to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above, we projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on the scheduled maturity dates of the credit facility, the term facility and the receivables facility. our actual interest payments could vary substantially from the amounts projected.
estimated interest payments due by period total             less than                           1-3 years                     3-5 years               more than

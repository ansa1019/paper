item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition organization of information this management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition ("md&a") of fedex corporation ("fedex" or the "company") is composed of three major sections: results of operations and outlook, financial condition, and critical accounting estimates. these sections include the following information:
•results of operations includes an overview of our consolidated 2023 results compared to 2022 results. this section also includes a discussion of key actions and events that impacted our results, as well as our outlook for 2024. discussion and analysis of 2021 results and year-over-year comparisons between 2022 results and 2021 results can be found in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition" of our annual report on form 10-k ("annual report") for the year ended may 31, 2022.
-  -
•the overview is followed by a discussion of both historical operating results and our outlook for 2024, as well as a financial summary and analysis for each of our transportation segments.
•our financial condition is reviewed through an analysis of key elements of our liquidity and capital resources, financial commitments, and liquidity outlook for 2024.
•critical accounting estimates discusses those financial statement elements that we believe are most important to understanding the material judgments and assumptions incorporated in our financial results.
the discussion in md&a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report, particularly "item 1. business," "item 1a. risk factors," and "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
description of business segments we provide a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services through companies competing collectively, operating collaboratively, and innovating digitally as one fedex. our primary operating companies are federal express corporation ("fedex express"), the world's largest express transportation company; fedex ground package system, inc. ("fedex ground"), a leading north american provider of small-package ground delivery services; and fedex freight corporation ("fedex freight"), a leading north american provider of less-than-truckload ("ltl") freight transportation services. these companies represent our major service lines and, along with fedex corporate services, inc. ("fedex services"), constitute our reportable segments. our fedex services segment provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services, and certain back-office functions that support our operating segments. the operating costs of the fedex services segment are allocated to the business units it serves. see "reportable segments" for further discussion and refer to "item 1. business" for a more detailed description of each of our operating companies and information regarding our "one fedex" consolidation plan to ultimately bring fedex express, fedex ground, fedex services, and other fedex operating companies into federal express corporation.
the key indicators necessary to understand our operating results include:
•the overall customer demand for our various services based on macroeconomic factors and the global economy;
•the volumes of transportation services provided through our networks, primarily measured by our average daily volume and shipment weight and size;
•the mix of services purchased by our customers;
•the prices we obtain for our services, primarily measured by yield (revenue per package or pound or revenue per shipment or hundredweight for ltl freight shipments);
•our ability to manage our cost structure (capital expenditures and operating expenses) to match shifting volume levels; and
•the timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our ability to recover incremental fuel costs through our fuel surcharges.
trends affecting our business the following trends significantly impact the indicators discussed above, as well as our business and operating results. see the risk factors identified under part i, item 1a. "risk factors" for more information. additionally, see "results of operations and outlook - consolidated results - outlook" and "results of operations and outlook - financial condition - liquidity outlook" below for additional information on efforts we are taking to mitigate adverse trends.
macroeconomic conditions while macroeconomic risks apply to most companies, we are particularly vulnerable. the transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trends in economic activity. our primary business is to transport goods, so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production of goods and the rate of growth of global trade. our results in 2023 were adversely impacted by lower global volumes due to weak economic conditions.
covid-19 pandemic and supply chain the coronavirus ("covid-19") pandemic had varying impacts on the demand for our services and our business operations and has contributed to global supply chain disruptions. during the first half of 2023, we continued to be affected by covid-19 lockdowns in asia, which impacted both manufacturing and supply chains. we have now shifted to operating in a more stable post-covid-19
-  -
environment with less restrictions, which resulted in consumers returning to near pre-pandemic shopping patterns during 2023. as global supply chains stabilized during 2023, we experienced improvements in the availability of labor and vehicles, trailers, and other package handling equipment.
inflation and interest rates global inflation is well above historical levels, impacting all areas of our business. additionally, global interest rates continue to rise in an effort to curb inflation. we are experiencing a decline in demand for our transportation services as inflation and interest rate increases are negatively affecting consumer and business spending. additionally, we are experiencing higher costs to serve through higher fuel prices, wage rates, purchased transportation costs, and other direct operating expenses such as operational supplies. we expect inflation and high interest rates to continue to negatively affect our results in 2024.
fuel we must purchase large quantities of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles, and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly volatile. the timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our ability to recover incremental fuel costs through our fuel surcharges can significantly affect our operating results either positively or negatively in the short-term. higher fuel prices drove an increase in yields through higher fuel surcharges and an increase in fuel expense during 2023 at all of our transportation segments.
geopolitical conflicts given the nature of our business and our global operations, geopolitical conflicts may adversely affect our business and results of operations. the conflict between russia and ukraine that began in february 2022 continues as of the date of this annual report. the safety of our team members in ukraine is our top priority. as we focus on the safety of our team members, we have suspended all services in ukraine and belarus. we also temporarily idled our operations in russia and reduced our presence to the minimum required for purposes of maintaining a legal presence with active transport licenses. as a result, we incurred an immaterial amount of severance and other related expenses in 2023, which is included in business optimization expenses at fedex express. while we do not expect this conflict to have a direct material impact on our business or results of operations, the broader consequences are adversely affecting the global economy and fuel prices generally and may also have the effect of heightening other risks disclosed under part i, item 1a. "risk factors." see "results of operations and outlook - consolidated results - business optimization and realignment costs" below for additional information.
-  -
results of operations and outlook many of our operating expenses are directly affected by revenue and volume levels, and we expect these operating expenses to fluctuate on a year-over-year basis consistent with changes in revenue and volumes. therefore, the discussion of operating expense captions focuses on the key drivers and trends affecting expenses other than those factors strictly related to changes in revenue and volumes. the line item "other operating expense" includes costs associated with outside service contracts (such as temporary labor, security, and facility services and cargo handling), insurance, professional fees, operational supplies, and bad debt.
except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended may 31, 2023 or ended may 31 of the year referenced, and comparisons are to the corresponding period of the prior year. references to our transportation segments include, collectively, the fedex express segment, the fedex ground segment, and the fedex freight segment.

overview our operating results for 2023 were negatively affected by macroeconomic conditions, including inflation well above historical levels, and elevated global interest rates. in response to market conditions, we implemented cost reductions and focused on yield improvement to partially mitigate the effect of volume declines. cost reductions included reducing flight hours, temporarily parking and retiring aircraft, improving productivity, delaying and reducing certain peak wage programs, consolidating and closing sorts, canceling network capacity projects, and reducing select sunday operations. the impact of cost actions lagged volume declines, particularly in the first half of 2023 and at fedex express, resulting in elevated operating expenses relative to demand. additionally, our results in the first half of 2023 were negatively impacted by service challenges at fedex express.
operating income in 2023 includes $70 million ($54 million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) of asset impairment charges associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines at fedex express, and also includes $47 million ($44 million, net of tax, or $0.17 per diluted share) of goodwill and other asset impairment charges associated with the shoprunner, inc. ("shoprunner") acquisition at fedex dataworks, inc. ("fedex dataworks"). see the "goodwill and other asset impairment charges" section of this md&a for more information.
operating income in 2023 includes $273 million ($209 million, net of tax, or $0.81 per diluted share) of expenses associated with our drive business optimization strategy announced in the first quarter of 2023, and also includes business realignment costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) associated with our workforce reduction plan in europe announced in 2021. operating income in 2022 includes $278 million ($214 million, net of tax, or $0.80 per diluted share) of costs under this program. see the "business optimization and realignment costs" section of this md&a for more information.
operating income includes a $35 million charge ($26 million, net of tax, or $0.10 per diluted share) in 2023 related to a fedex ground legal matter and a $210 million charge ($160 million, net of tax, or $0.60 per diluted share) in 2022 related to pre- and post-judgment interest in connection with a separate fedex ground legal matter. the amounts are included in "corporate, other, and eliminations."
operating expenses in 2022 include $132 million ($103 million, net of tax, or $0.39 per diluted share) of tnt express integration expenses.
net income includes a pre-tax, noncash gain of $650 million in 2023 ($493 million, net of tax, or $1.92 per diluted share) and a loss of $1.6 billion in 2022 ($1.2 billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share) associated with our mtm retirement plans accounting adjustments. see the "retirement plans mtm adjustments" section of this md&a and note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
net income in 2023 includes a $46 million ($0.18 per diluted share) tax expense from a revaluation of certain foreign tax assets. in 2022, we recognized a $142 million ($0.53 per diluted share) tax benefit related to revisions of prior-year tax estimates for actual tax return results. see the "income taxes" section of this md&a and note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
in december 2021, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $5 billion of fedex common stock. as part of the repurchase program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreement with a bank in october 2022, which was completed in december 2022, to repurchase an aggregate of $1.5 billion of our common stock. share repurchases had a benefit of $0.34 per diluted share in 2023. see note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the "financial condition-liquidity" section of this md&a for additional information on our stock repurchase program.

revenue revenue decreased 4% in 2023 primarily due to global volume declines at all of our transportation segments, partially offset by yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges.
fedex express revenue decreased 7% in 2023 due to lower global volume and unfavorable foreign currency, partially offset by yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges. revenue at corporate, other, and eliminations decreased due to lower yields and volumes at fedex trade networks transport & brokerage, inc. fedex ground revenue and fedex freight revenue each increased 1% in 2023, primarily due to yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges, partially offset by lower volume.
goodwill and other asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 boeing md-11f aircraft and 25 related engines, four boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two airbus a300-600 aircraft and eight related engines, to align with the plans of fedex express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. as a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter. all of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in revenue service.
in the fourth quarter of 2023, we also recorded a noncash impairment charge of $36 million ($36 million, net of tax, or $0.14 per diluted share) for all of the goodwill attributable to fedex dataworks. the key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the shoprunner business during 2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition. based on these factors, our outlook for the business changed in the fourth quarter of 2023. we also recorded an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) noncash intangible asset impairment charge related to the shoprunner acquisition at fedex dataworks. for additional information regarding these impairment charges, see the "critical accounting estimates" section of this md&a and note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
business optimization and realignment costs in the second quarter of 2023, fedex announced drive, a comprehensive program to improve the company's long-term profitability. this program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments and lower our overhead and support costs. we plan to consolidate our sortation facilities and equipment, reduce pickup-and-delivery routes, and optimize our enterprise linehaul network by moving beyond discrete collaboration to an end-to-end optimized network through network 2.0.
in the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced one fedex, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring fedex express, fedex ground, fedex services, and other fedex operating companies into federal express corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the respected fedex brand. fedex freight will continue to provide ltl freight transportation services as a stand-alone and separate company under federal express corporation. the organizational redesign will be implemented in phases with full implementation expected in june 2024. one fedex will help facilitate our drive transformation program to improve long-term profitability.
we have announced the implementation of network 2.0 in more than 20 markets, including the phased transition of all fedex ground operations and personnel in canada to fedex express beginning in april 2024. under network 2.0, fedex will continue to utilize both employees and contracted service providers.
we incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $273 million ($209 million, net of tax, or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. these costs were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in russia. these business optimization costs are included in corporate, other, and eliminations and fedex express. the identification of these costs as business optimization-related expenditures is subject to our disclosure controls and procedures. we expect the pre-tax cost of our business optimization activities to be approximately $500 million in 2024 and approximately $2.0 billion through 2025. the timing and amount of our business optimization expenses may change as we revise and implement our plans.
in 2021, fedex express announced a workforce reduction plan in europe related to the network integration of tnt express. the plan affected approximately 5,000 employees in europe across operational teams and back-office functions and was completed during 2023. we incurred costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) in 2023 and $278 million ($214 million, net of tax, or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 associated with our business realignment activities. these costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. payments under this program totaled approximately $118 million in 2023 and approximately $225 million in 2022. the pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities was approximately $430 million through 2023. we expect savings from our business realignment activities to be approximately $275 million on an annualized basis beginning in 2024.

(4)includes a $35 million charge in 2023 related to a fedex ground legal matter and a $210 million charge in 2022 related to pre- and post-judgment interest in connection with a separate fedex ground legal matter.
operating income declined in 2023 primarily due to lower volumes at each of our transportation segments, partially offset by yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges. cost reduction efforts such as reducing flight hours, temporarily parking and retiring aircraft, improving productivity, delaying and reducing certain peak wage programs, consolidating and closing sorts, canceling network capacity projects, and reducing select sunday operations partially mitigated the effects of volume declines on our results.
global inflation drove higher operating expenses related to salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses in 2023. in addition, higher self-insurance and bad debt accruals contributed to an increase in other operating expense in 2023.
we recognized $70 million of asset impairment charges associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines at fedex express. our 2023 results also include $47 million of goodwill and other asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2023 associated with the shoprunner acquisition at fedex dataworks. for additional information regarding these impairment charges, see the "goodwill and other asset impairment charges" and "critical accounting estimates" sections of this md&a and note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
fuel we apply a fuel surcharge on our air and ground services, most of which are adjusted on a weekly basis. the fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from ten days prior to the week in which it is assessed. some fedex express international fuel surcharges are updated on a monthly basis. we routinely review our fuel surcharges and periodically update the tables used to determine our fuel surcharges at all of our transportation segments.
while fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield. additional components include the mix of services sold, the base price, and extra service charges we obtain for these services and level of pricing discounts offered.
fuel expense increased 16% during 2023 due to higher fuel prices, partially offset by a decline in fuel usage. in addition to variability in usage and market prices, the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences our results. for example, our contracts for jet fuel purchases at fedex express are tied to various indices, including the u.s. gulf coast index. while many of these indices are aligned, each index may fluctuate at a different pace, driving variability in the prices paid for jet fuel. furthermore, under these contractual arrangements, approximately 70% of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week, with the remainder of our purchases tied primarily to the index price for the preceding month and preceding day, rather than based on daily spot rates. these contractual provisions mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rates on our jet fuel purchases.
-  -
because of the factors described above, our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges, which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short-term. for more information, see "item 1a. risk factors."
other income and expense other retirement plans income (expense) increased primarily due to a noncash mtm gain of $650 million in 2023 compared to a $1.6 billion loss in 2022 (described below). in addition, interest income increased $145 million in 2023 primarily due to an increase in interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in other income of $120 million related to changes in the value of equity investments.
retirement plans mtm adjustments in 2023, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash mtm gain of $650 million ($493 million, net of tax, or $1.92 per diluted share), related to the year-end actuarial adjustments of pension and postretirement healthcare plans' assets and liabilities. these actuarial adjustments were due to higher discount rates, partially offset by lower than expected asset returns and demographic experience.
in 2022, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash mtm loss of $1.6 billion ($1.2 billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share), which includes a net loss of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion, net of tax, or $3.76 per diluted share) related to the year-end actuarial adjustments of pension and postretirement healthcare plans' assets and liabilities. these actuarial adjustments were due to lower than expected asset returns, demographic experience, and an update to the mortality assumption, partially offset by higher discount rates.
additionally, in 2022, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash mtm net loss of $260 million ($195 million, net of tax, or $0.73 per diluted share) in the second quarter of 2022, of which $224 million was related to the termination of the tnt express netherlands pension plan. effective october 1, 2021, the responsibility of all pension assets and liabilities of this plan was transferred to a separate, multi-employer pension plan. the remaining $36 million net loss was related to the u.s. fedex freight pension plan and consisted of a $75 million mtm loss due to a lower discount rate in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by a $39 million curtailment gain.

income taxes our effective tax rate was 25.9% for 2023, compared to 21.9% for 2022. the 2023 tax provision was negatively impacted by an expense of $46 million related to a write-down and valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credit carryforwards due to operational changes which impacted the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax asset. the 2023 tax provision was also negatively impacted by lower earnings in certain non-u.s. jurisdictions.
the 2022 tax provision includes a benefit of $142 million related to revisions of prior year tax estimates for actual tax return results. the 2022 tax provision was also favorably impacted by changes in our corporate legal entity structure.
we are subject to taxation in the u.s. and various u.s. state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service ("irs") for the 2016 through 2019 tax years. it is reasonably possible that certain income tax return proceedings will be completed during the next 12 months and could result in a change in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits. however, we believe we have recorded adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, for any adjustments expected to occur.
during 2021, we filed suit in u.s. district court for the western district of tennessee challenging the validity of a tax regulation related to the one-time transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, which was enacted as part of the tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja"). our lawsuit seeks to have the court declare this regulation invalid and order the refund of overpayments of u.s. federal income taxes for 2018 and 2019 attributable to the denial of foreign tax credits under the regulation. we have recorded a cumulative benefit of $223 million through 2023 attributable to our interpretation of the tcja and the internal revenue code. on march 31, 2023, the district court ruled that the regulation is invalid and contradicts the plain terms of the tax code. we continue to work towards obtaining a final judgment for the applicable refund amounts due to the regulation being invalid. once the district court enters a final judgment, the u.s. government could file an appeal with the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit. if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, we may be required to reverse the benefit previously recorded.

equity investment as of may 31, 2023, we do not have any equity investments that are material to our financial position or results of operations. for more information on equity investments, see note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
outlook during 2024, we expect macroeconomic conditions to continue to negatively impact customer demand for our services. however, we expect operating income improvement in 2024 as a result of our drive program initiatives focused on aligning our cost base with demand, reducing our permanent cost structure, and increasing the flexibility of our network. we expect international export yield declines and reduced customer demand for our u.s. freight product at fedex express to negatively impact revenue and operating income in 2024. in addition, we expect expense headwinds in 2024 related to higher global inflation and variable incentive compensation.
see the "business optimization and realignment costs" section of this md&a for additional information on our drive program and other cost savings initiatives.
our capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion, a decrease of $0.5 billion from 2023, as we continue to reduce our capital intensity relative to revenue. we expect lower aircraft spend and reduced capacity investment to be partially offset by investments to optimize our networks and modernize our facilities. our expected capital expenditures for 2024 include our continued investments in the expansion and modernization of the fedex express indianapolis hub and modernization of the fedex express memphis world hub.
we will continue to evaluate our investments in critical long-term strategic projects to ensure our capital expenditures are expected to generate high returns on investment and are balanced with our outlook for global economic conditions. for additional details on key 2024 capital projects, refer to the "financial condition - capital resources" and "financial condition - liquidity outlook" sections of this md&a.
the uncertainty of a slowing global economy, global inflation well above historical levels, geopolitical challenges including the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine, and the impact these factors will have on the rate of growth of global trade, supply chains, fuel prices, and our business in particular, make any expectations for 2024 inherently less certain. see "item 1a. risk factors" for more information.
see "forward-looking statements", "item 1a. risk factors", "trends affecting our business", and "critical accounting estimates" for a discussion of these and other potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance.
seasonality of business our businesses are cyclical in nature, as seasonal fluctuations affect volumes, revenue, and earnings. historically, the u.s. express package business experiences an increase in volumes in late november and december. international business, particularly in the asia-to-u.s. market, peaks in october and november in advance of the u.s. holiday sales season. our first and third fiscal quarters, because they are summer vacation and post winter-holiday seasons, have historically experienced lower volumes relative to other periods. normally, the fall is the busiest shipping period for fedex ground, while late december, june and july are the slowest periods. for fedex freight, the spring and fall are the busiest periods and the latter part of december through february is the slowest period. shipment levels, operating costs, and earnings for each of our companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather, particularly the impact of severe winter weather in our third fiscal quarter. see "item 1a. risk factors" for more information.

reportable segments fedex express, fedex ground, and fedex freight represent our major service lines and, along with fedex services, constitute our reportable segments. our reportable segments include the following businesses:
fedex express segment    fedex express (express transportation, small-package ground delivery, and freight transportation)
fedex custom critical, inc. (time-critical transportation)
fedex ground segment     fedex ground (small-package ground delivery)
fedex freight segment    fedex freight (ltl freight transportation)
fedex services segment   fedex services (sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services, and back-office functions)
in the fourth quarter of 2023, fedex announced one fedex, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring fedex express, fedex ground, fedex services, and other fedex operating companies into federal express corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the respected fedex brand. the organizational redesign will be implemented in phases with full implementation expected in june 2024. during the implementation process in fiscal 2024, each of our current reportable segments will continue to have discrete financial information that will be regularly reviewed when evaluating performance and making resource allocation decisions, and aligns with our management reporting structure and our internal financial reporting. in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, when the consolidation plan has been completed, we expect to begin reporting a resegmented structure that will align with an updated management reporting structure and how management will evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions under one fedex.
fedex services segment the fedex services segment provides direct and indirect support to our operating segments, and we allocate all of the net operating costs of the fedex services segment to reflect the full cost of operating our businesses in the results of those segments. we review and evaluate the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income (inclusive of fedex services segment allocations). for the fedex services segment, performance is evaluated based on the effect of its total allocated net operating costs on our operating segments.
operating expenses for each of our transportation segments include the allocations from the fedex services segment to the respective transportation segments. these allocations include charges and credits for administrative services provided between operating companies. the allocations of net operating costs are based on metrics such as relative revenue or estimated services provided. we believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions. our allocation methodologies are refined periodically, as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses.
corporate, other, and eliminations corporate and other includes corporate headquarters costs for executive officers and certain legal and finance functions, including certain other costs and credits not attributed to our core business, as well as certain costs associated with developing our "innovate digitally" strategic pillar through our fedex dataworks operating segment. fedex dataworks is focused on creating solutions to transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members. shoprunner, inc. was merged into fedex dataworks during 2023.
also included in corporate and other is the fedex office and print services, inc. operating segment, which provides an array of document and business services and retail access to our customers for our package transportation businesses, and the fedex logistics, inc. operating segment, which provides integrated supply chain management solutions, specialty transportation, customs brokerage, and global ocean and air freight forwarding.
the results of corporate, other, and eliminations are not allocated to the other business segments.
-  -
in 2023, the decrease in operating results in corporate, other, and eliminations was primarily due to lower operating income at fedex logistics due to decreased revenue and an increase in bad debt, partially offset by decreased purchased transportation expense. additionally, operating results in corporate, other, and eliminations were negatively impacted by higher professional fees and outside service contract spend at fedex dataworks. the comparison of operating loss between 2023 and 2022 at corporate, other, and eliminations is affected by goodwill and other asset impairment charges of $47 million associated with the shoprunner acquisition at fedex dataworks in 2023.
certain fedex operating companies provide transportation and related services for other fedex companies outside their reportable segment in order to optimize our resources. for example, during 2023 fedex ground provided delivery support for certain fedex express packages as part of our last-mile optimization efforts, and fedex freight provided road and intermodal support for both fedex ground and fedex express. in addition, fedex express is working with fedex logistics to secure air charters and other cargo space for u.s. customers. billings for such services are based on negotiated rates, which we believe approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenue of the billing segment. these rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. such intersegment revenue and expenses are eliminated in our consolidated results and are not separately identified in the following segment information because the amounts are not material.

(1)international domestic statistics relate to our international intra-country operations.
fedex express segment revenue fedex express segment revenue decreased 7% in 2023 primarily due to decreased global volume and unfavorable exchange rates, partially offset by yield improvement.
total average daily package volume decreased 10% in 2023, and total average daily freight pounds decreased 14% in 2023, due to reduced demand for our services, primarily resulting from macroeconomic conditions. volume declines were partially offset by yield improvement, including increases in composite package yield of 6% and composite freight yield of 2% in 2023. the 6% increase in composite package yield was primarily due to a u.s. domestic package yield increase of 12%, driven by higher base yields and fuel surcharges. unfavorable exchange rates negatively impacted all international package and freight product yields in 2023.
fedex express segment operating income fedex express segment operating income decreased 64% in 2023 primarily due to global volume declines, partially offset by yield improvement and lower operating expenses. during 2023, we implemented cost reductions to mitigate the impact of volume declines, including reducing flight hours, temporarily parking and retiring aircraft, improving productivity, and consolidating routes and closing sorts. the impact of these reductions, while improving throughout the year, lagged volume declines, and operating expenses remained high relative to demand. currency exchange rates had a negative effect on revenue and a positive effect on expenses, resulting in a slightly negative effect on operating income in 2023.

fuel expense increased 16% in 2023 due to a 27% increase in fuel prices, partially offset by a 9% decline in total fuel gallons. purchased transportation expense decreased 11% in 2023 primarily due to favorable exchange rates and lower utilization, partially offset by higher rates charged by third-party providers. salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 3% in 2023 primarily due to decreased staffing to align with lower volume, favorable currency exchange rates, and lower variable incentive compensation, partially offset by increased wage rates. rentals and landing fees expense decreased 10% in 2023 primarily due to decreased aircraft leases and favorable currency exchange rates. other operating expense decreased 2% in 2023 primarily due to favorable currency exchange rates and lower outside service contract expense, partially offset by higher bad debt expense. maintenance and repairs expense decreased 6% in 2023 primarily due to lower aircraft maintenance resulting from an increase in aircraft temporarily parked.
during 2023, we recorded asset impairment charges of $70 million associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines. see "goodwill and other asset impairment charges" above for more information. additionally, fedex express segment results include business realignment costs of $36 million in 2023 associated with our workforce reduction plan in europe. we recognized $278 million of costs in 2022 under this program. fedex express segment results also include business optimization costs of $11 million in 2023, which includes costs associated with idling our business in russia. see the "business optimization and realignment costs" section of this md&a for more information.
fedex express segments results include $115 million of tnt express integration expenses in 2022.

cash provided by operating activities. cash flows from operating activities decreased $1.0 billion in 2023 primarily due to lower net income (net of noncash items), as well as a decrease in accounts payable and legal settlements, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable.
cash used in investing activities. capital expenditures were 9% lower in 2023 primarily due to decreased spending on aircraft. see "capital resources" below for a more detailed discussion of capital expenditures during 2023.
financing activities. in december 2021, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $5 billion of fedex common stock. as part of the repurchase program, we completed an asr agreement with a bank in the third quarter of 2023 to repurchase an aggregate of $1.5 billion of our common stock. a total of 9.2 million shares were repurchased under the agreement.

during 2022, as part of the repurchase program, we completed an asr agreement with a bank to repurchase an aggregate of $1.5 billion of our common stock, and 6.1 million shares were delivered. we also repurchased an additional 2.8 million shares of our common stock during 2022.
the following table provides a summary of repurchases of our common stock for the periods ended may 31 (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):

as of may 31, 2023, $2.6 billion remains available to be used for repurchases under the program authorized in december 2021, which is the only program that currently exists. shares under the program may be repurchased from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. the program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. see note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.
capital resources our operations are capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in aircraft, package handling and sort equipment, vehicles and trailers, technology, and facilities. the amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors, including pre-existing contractual commitments, anticipated volume growth, domestic and international economic conditions, new or enhanced services, geographical expansion of services, availability of satisfactory financing, and actions of regulatory authorities.

guarantor financial information we are providing the following information in compliance with rule 13-01 of regulation s-x, "financial disclosures about guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities" with respect to our senior unsecured debt securities and pass-through certificates, series 2020-1aa (the "certificates").
the $19.2 billion principal amount of the senior unsecured notes were issued by fedex under a shelf registration statement and are guaranteed by certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of fedex ("guarantor subsidiaries"). fedex owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of each guarantor subsidiary. the guarantees are (1) unsecured obligations of the respective guarantor subsidiary, (2) rank equally with all of their other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and (3) are full and unconditional and joint and several. if we sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all of the capital stock or all or substantially all of the assets of a guarantor subsidiary to any person that is not an affiliate of fedex, the guarantee of that guarantor subsidiary will terminate, and holders of debt securities will no longer have a direct claim against such subsidiary under the guarantee.

additionally, fedex fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment obligation of fedex express in respect of the $840 million principal amount of the certificates. see note 6 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the terms of the certificates.

liquidity outlook in response to current business and economic conditions as referenced above in the "outlook" section of this md&a, we are continuing to actively manage and optimize our capital allocation to mitigate the impact of the slowing economy, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical conflicts. we held $6.9 billion in cash at may 31, 2023 and have $3.5 billion in available liquidity under our $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (the "five-year credit agreement) and $1.5 billion three-year credit agreement (the "three-year credit agreement" and together with the five-year credit agreement, the "credit agreements"), and we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and available financing sources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs, which include operational requirements, expected capital expenditures, voluntary pension contributions, dividend payments, and stock repurchases.

as announced on june 20, 2023, we expect to repurchase $2.0 billion of our common stock in 2024. we executed an asr agreement with a bank in june 2023 to repurchase an aggregate of $500 million of our common stock with a completion date no later than august 2023.
our cash and cash equivalents balance at may 31, 2023 includes $2.6 billion of cash in foreign jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy. we are able to access the majority of this cash without a material tax cost and do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds impairs our ability to meet our u.s. domestic debt or working capital obligations.
our capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion, a decrease of $0.5 billion from 2023, as we continue to reduce our capital intensity relative to revenue. we expect lower aircraft spend and reduced capacity investment to be partially offset by investments to optimize our networks and modernize our facilities. included within our expected 2024 capital expenditures are our continued investments in the expansion and modernization of the fedex express indianapolis hub and modernization of the fedex express memphis world hub, which are expected to total $1.5 billion each over the life of each project. our expected capital expenditures for 2024 also include $1.5 billion for delivery of aircraft and related equipment and progress payments toward future aircraft deliveries at fedex express.
we have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures, which consist of debt obligations, lease obligations, and obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. refer to note 6, note 7, and note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information. in addition, we have certain tax positions that are further discussed in note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. we do not have any guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.
we have several aircraft modernization programs under way that are supported by the purchase of boeing 777 freighter and boeing 767-300 freighter aircraft. these aircraft are significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized, and these expenditures are necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to replace older aircraft. our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft-related expenditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements.
we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission ("sec") that allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock and allows pass-through trusts formed by fedex express to sell, in one or more future offerings, pass-through certificates.
the five-year credit agreement expires in march 2026 and includes a $250 million letter of credit sublimit. the three-year credit agreement expires in march 2025. the credit agreements are available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs. see note 6 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the terms and significant covenants of the credit agreements.
we made a voluntary contribution of $200 million to our tax-qualified u.s. domestic pension plans ("u.s. pension plans") in june 2023 and anticipate making $600 million of additional voluntary contributions during the remainder of 2024. there are currently no required minimum contributions to our u.s. pension plans based on current funded status and credit balance due to cumulative excess voluntary pension contributions, which exceeds $3.0 billion. the credit balance is subtracted from plan assets to determine the minimum funding requirements. therefore, we could eliminate all required contributions to our principal u.s. pension plans for several years if we were to choose to waive part of that credit balance in any given year. our u.s. pension plans have ample funds to meet expected benefit payments.
on april 5, 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.26 per share of common stock. the dividend was paid on july 3, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on june 12, 2023. each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our board of directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis. there are no material restrictions on our ability to declare dividends, nor are there any material restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances.
standard & poor's has assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of bbb, a certificates rating of aa-, a commercial paper rating of a-2, and a ratings outlook of "stable." moody's investors service has assigned us an unsecured debt credit rating of baa2, a certificates rating of aa3, a commercial paper rating of p-2, and a ratings outlook of "stable." if our credit ratings drop, our interest expense may increase. if our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels, we may have difficulty utilizing the commercial paper market. if our senior unsecured debt credit ratings drop below investment grade, our access to financing may become limited.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. in many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a complex, global corporation. however, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and new or better information.
the estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our results of operations and financial condition. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm.
retirement plans the rules for pension accounting are complex and can produce volatility in our earnings, financial condition, and liquidity. our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured using actuarial techniques that reflect management's assumptions for expected returns on assets ("eroa"), discount rate, and demographic experience such as salary increases, expected retirement, mortality, employee turnover, and future increases in healthcare costs. differences between these assumptions and actual experience are recognized in our earnings through mtm accounting. the components of the mtm adjustments for the period ended may 31 are as follows (presented as (gain) loss in millions):

income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our income taxes are a function of our income, tax planning opportunities available to us, statutory tax rates, and the income tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by us and the respective governmental taxing authorities. as a result, significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. also, our effective tax rate is significantly affected by the earnings generated in each jurisdiction, so unexpected fluctuations in the geographic mix of earnings could significantly impact our tax rate. our intercompany transactions are based on globally accepted transfer pricing principles, which align profits with the business operations and functions of the various legal entities in our international business.
we evaluate our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. these evaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax laws or their interpretations, audit activity, and changes in our business. in addition, management considers the advice of third parties in making conclusions regarding tax consequences.
tax contingencies arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rules throughout the many jurisdictions in which we operate. despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. we record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management's evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. to be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on the technical merits. the benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement.
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income rely heavily on estimates to make this determination, and as a result there is a risk that these estimates will have to be revised as new information is received. to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. we believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets that are not subject to valuation allowances. we record the taxes for global intangible low-taxed income as a period cost.
our income tax positions are based on currently enacted tax laws. as further guidance is issued by the u.s. treasury department, the irs, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.
for more information, see the "income taxes" section of this md&a and note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
self-insurance accruals our self-insurance reserves are established for estimates of ultimate loss on all incurred claims, including incurred-but-not-reported claims. components of our self-insurance reserves included in this critical accounting estimate are workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. these reserves are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. these estimates include judgment about severity of claims, frequency and volume of claims, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs. the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known, which may be several years.
we believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. nevertheless, changes in accident frequency and severity, healthcare costs, insurance retention levels, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities and affect our results of operations. self-insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet for the period ended may 31 are as follows (in millions):
2023              2022
short-term            $1,730            $1,646
long-term              3,339             2,889
total                 $5,069            $4,535
-  -
a five-percent reduction or improvement in the assumed claim severity used to estimate our self-insurance accruals would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $250 million in our reserves and expenses as of and for the year ended may 31, 2023. for more information, see "item 1a. risk factors" of this annual report.
long-lived assets useful lives and salvage values. our business is capital intensive, with approximately 60% of our owned assets invested in our transportation and information system infrastructures.
the depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events. because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 30 years), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset. these evaluations consider usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors that affect the useful life of an asset. this evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment.
for our aircraft, we consider actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and future volume projections in estimating the useful lives and expected salvage values. we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of our aircraft in cargo configuration, which results in little to no value at the end of their useful life. these estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods and could have a material impact on our results of operations (as described below). historically, gains and losses on disposals of operating equipment have not been material. however, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to changes in business levels, technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory changes, and other factors beyond our control.
impairment. as of may 31, 2023, the fedex express global air network included a fleet of 700 aircraft (including 293 supplemental aircraft) that provide delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through a wide range of u.s. and international shipping services. while certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic areas (u.s. versus international), we operate an integrated global network, and utilize our aircraft and other modes of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitments to our customers. because of the integrated nature of our global network, our aircraft are interchangeable across routes and geographies, giving us flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic conditions and maintain and modify aircraft as needed.
because of the lengthy lead times for aircraft manufacture and modifications, we must anticipate volume levels and plan our fleet requirements years in advance, and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. furthermore, the timing and availability of certain used aircraft types (particularly those with better fuel efficiency) may create limited opportunities to acquire these aircraft at favorable prices in advance of our capacity needs. these activities create risks that asset capacity may exceed demand. at may 31, 2023, we had three purchased aircraft that were not yet placed into service.
we evaluate our long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by that asset group are less than the carrying amounts of the asset group and may not be recoverable. if the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value. we operate integrated transportation networks, and accordingly, cash flows for most of our operating assets are assessed at a network level, not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment. further, decisions about capital investments are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset. we make decisions to remove certain long-lived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs or lower operating costs of newer aircraft types, and those decisions may result in an impairment charge. assets held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values less costs to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criteria are met. the fair value determinations for such aircraft may require management estimates, as there may not be active markets for some of these aircraft. such estimates are subject to revision from period to period.
in the fourth quarter of 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 boeing md-11f aircraft and 25 related engines, four boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two airbus a300-600 aircraft and eight related engines, to align with the plans of fedex express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. as a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter. all of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in revenue service.
in addition, in the fourth quarter of 2023, fedex express made the decision to accelerate the retirement of 46 md-11f aircraft and related engines to aid in our fleet modernization, improve our global network, and better align air network capacity of fedex express to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. as a result of this decision, we expect a net increase of approximately $12 million in depreciation expense in 2024 with the expense impact in 2025 being immaterial.

in the normal management of our aircraft fleet, we routinely idle aircraft and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and adjustments of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand levels. temporarily idled assets are classified as available-for-use, and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these assets. these temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment and remaining life on a quarterly basis. the criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently removed from service (and, as a result, is potentially impaired) include, but are not limited to, our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels, including capacity needs during our peak shipping seasons; the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations; and changes to planned service expansion activities. at may 31, 2023, we had 11 aircraft temporarily idled. these aircraft have been idled for an average of five months and are expected to return to revenue service in order to meet expected demand.
during the fourth quarter of 2023, we reviewed long-lived assets at fedex dataworks for impairment. based on our reviews, we recognized an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) asset impairment charge related to an intangible asset from the shoprunner acquisition. for more information, see note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
leases. we utilize operating leases to finance certain of our aircraft, facilities, and equipment. such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor. in accordance with the new lease accounting standard adopted in 2020, we had $18 billion in operating lease liabilities and $17 billion in related right-of-use assets on the balance sheet as of may 31, 2023. the weighted-average remaining lease term of all operating leases outstanding at may 31, 2023 was 9.5 years.
our leases generally contain options to extend or terminate the lease. we reevaluate our leases on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options, and how they align with our operating strategy. therefore, substantially all the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the options to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement. short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized in the right-to-use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets.
the lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which we would borrow, on a collateralized basis, over the term of a lease in the applicable currency environment. the interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where we are the lessee.
the determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a finance lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life. in addition, our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build-to-suit lease arrangements and making judgments about whether various forms of lessee involvement during the construction period allow the lessee to control the underlying leased asset during the construction period. we believe we have well-defined and controlled processes for making these evaluations, including obtaining third-party appraisals for material transactions to assist us in making these evaluations.
goodwill. we had $6.4 billion of recorded goodwill at may 31, 2023 and $6.5 billion of recorded goodwill at may 31, 2022 from our business acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the expected benefits from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business.
goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. in our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimates to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. an entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. we performed both qualitative and quantitative assessments of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022. this included comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies (principally the income or market approach classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy) incorporating market participant considerations and management's assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, and expected capital expenditures. estimates used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test. changes in forecasted operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates.
as part of our qualitative assessment, we consider changes in the macroeconomic environment such as the general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and other developments in equity and credit markets.

the market approach uses observable market data of comparable public companies to estimate fair value utilizing financial metrics such as operating value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. we apply judgment to select appropriate comparison companies based on the business operations, growth, size, and risk profile relative to our reporting units. changes to our selection of comparable companies may result in changes to the estimates of fair value of our reporting units.
in connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded an impairment charge of $36 million ($36 million, net of tax, or $0.14 per diluted share) for all of the goodwill attributable to our fedex dataworks reporting unit. the key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the shoprunner business during 2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition. based on these factors, our outlook for the business changed in the fourth quarter of 2023.
our other reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include fedex express, fedex ground, and fedex freight. we evaluated these reporting units during the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of the end of 2023 and 2022; therefore, we do not believe that any of these reporting units were impaired as of the balance sheet dates.
legal and other contingencies we are subject to various loss contingencies in connection with our operations. contingent liabilities are difficult to measure, as their measurement is subject to multiple factors that are not easily predicted or projected. further, additional complexity in measuring these liabilities arises due to the various jurisdictions in which these matters occur, which makes our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain. moreover, different accounting rules must be employed to account for these items based on the nature of the contingency. accordingly, significant management judgment is required to assess these matters and to make determinations about the measurement of a liability, if any. certain pending loss contingencies are described in note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. in the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, of individual matters or groups of related matters not specifically described in note 18 is not expected to be material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. the following describes our methods and associated processes for evaluating these matters.
because of the complex environment in which we operate, we are subject to numerous legal proceedings and claims, including those relating to general commercial matters, governmental enforcement actions, employment-related claims, vehicle accidents, and fedex ground's service providers. accounting guidance for contingencies requires an accrual of estimated loss from a contingency, such as a non-income tax or other legal proceeding or claim, when it is probable (i.e., the future event or events are likely to occur) that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. this guidance also requires disclosure of a loss contingency matter when, in management's judgment, a material loss is reasonably possible or probable.
during the preparation of our financial statements, we evaluate our contingencies to determine whether it is probable, reasonably possible, or remote that a liability has been incurred. a loss is recognized for all contingencies deemed probable and estimable, regardless of amount. for unresolved contingencies with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible, we evaluate whether a potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.
our evaluation of these matters is the result of a comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of a loss or disclosure of these contingencies is made in a timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel, as well as external counsel where applicable. the process includes regular communications during each quarter and scheduled meetings shortly before the completion of our financial statements to evaluate any new legal proceedings and the status of existing matters.
in determining whether a loss should be accrued or a loss contingency disclosed, we evaluate, among other factors:
•the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit or proceeding (e.g., the lengthy and complex nature of class-action matters);
•the procedural status of each matter;
•any opportunities to dispose of a lawsuit on its merits before trial (i.e., motion to dismiss or for summary judgment);
•the amount of time remaining before a trial date;
•the status of discovery;
•the status of settlement, arbitration, or mediation proceedings; and
•our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial.
-  -
in reaching our conclusions with respect to accrual of a loss or loss contingency disclosure, we take a holistic view of each matter based on these factors and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements. uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factors may impact our decisions related to accrual or disclosure of a loss contingency, including a conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or a meaningful range of possible loss. we update our disclosures to reflect our most current understanding of the contingencies at the time we issue our financial statements. however, events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss.
despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingencies, we believe that our processes are robust and thorough and provide a consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingencies for proper accounting recognition and disclosure.

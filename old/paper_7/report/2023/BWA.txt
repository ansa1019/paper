charging forward - electrification portfolio strategy in 2021, the company announced its strategy to aggressively grow its eproducts over time through organic investments and technology-focused acquisitions. eproducts include all products utilized on or for electric vehicles ("evs") plus those same products and components that are included in hybrid powertrains whose underlying technologies are adaptable or applicable to those used in or for evs. the company believes it is well positioned for the industry's anticipated migration to evs.
in june 2023, the company announced the next phase of its charging forward strategy, which focuses on profitably growing eproducts while maximizing the value of the company's foundational products portfolio. foundational products include all products utilized on internal combustion engines plus those same products and components that are also included in hybrid powertrains. as a result of executing its strategy, the company expects that by 2027, it will achieve over $10 billion in annual eproduct sales, deliver eproduct adjusted operating margin of approximately 7% and maintain its double-digit adjusted operating margin for its foundational products portfolio. during the year ended december 31, 2023, the company's eproduct revenue was approximately $2.0 billion, or 14% of its total revenue.

key trends and economic factors commodities and other inflationary impacts. prices for commodities remain volatile, and since the beginning of 2021, the company has experienced price increases for base metals (e.g., steel, aluminum and nickel), precious metals (e.g., palladium), silicon carbide, and raw materials that are primarily used in batteries for electric vehicles (e.g., lithium and cobalt). in addition, many global economies, including the united states, are experiencing elevated levels of inflation more generally, which is driving an increase in other input costs. as a result, the company has experienced, and is continuing to experience, higher costs.
in 2022 and 2023, following non-contractual negotiations, the company reached agreement for the pass through and recovery of higher costs with various customers. these agreements did not enable the company to recover 100 percent of its increased costs, and as a result, the company's operating margins were negatively impacted.
foreign currency impacts. the rapid strengthening of the u.s. dollar in 2022, which continued in 2023, albeit to a lesser extent, relative to major foreign currencies, including the euro, korean won and chinese renminbi, and related translation of these currencies to the u.s. dollar, unfavorably impacted the company's net sales, earnings and cash flows. continued significant fluctuations of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar may further negatively impact the company's financial results.
outlook the company expects global industry production to be flat or to decrease modestly year over year in 2024. however, the company expects net new business-related sales growth, due to the increased penetration of borgwarner products, including eproducts, to drive a sales increase in excess of the change in industry production outlook. as a result, the company expects increased revenue in 2024, excluding the impact of foreign currencies. the company expects the earnings benefit of this revenue growth to be partially offset by the negative earnings impact of the acquisition of eldor.
the company maintains a positive long-term outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic investments to enhance its product leadership strategy. there are several trends that are driving the company's long-term growth that management expects to continue, including adoption of product offerings for electrified vehicles and increasingly stringent global emissions standards that support demand for the company's products that drive vehicle efficiency.

•favorable volume, mix and net new business increased sales approximately $1,418 million, or 10%. this increase was primarily driven by higher weighted average market production as estimated by the company, which was up approximately 11% from the year ended december 31, 2022. the remaining increase primarily reflects the sales growth above market production, which the company believes reflects higher demand for its products. weighted average market production reflects light and commercial vehicle production as reported by ihs weighted for the company's geographic exposure, as estimated by the company.
•fluctuations in foreign currencies resulted in a year-over-year decrease in sales of approximately $66 million, primarily due to the weakening of the chinese renminbi and korean won, partially offset by the strengthening of the euro, in each case relative to the u.s. dollar.
•recoveries from the company's customers of material cost inflation arising from non-contractual commercial negotiations with those customers and normal contractual customer commodity pass-through arrangements increased net sales by approximately $158 million.

•higher sales volume, mix and net new business increased cost of sales by approximately $1,012 million.
•fluctuations in foreign currencies resulted in a year-over-year decrease in cost of sales of approximately $30 million, primarily due to the weakening of the chinese renminbi and korean won, partially offset by the strengthening of the euro, in each case relative to the u.s. dollar.
•cost of sales was also impacted by material cost inflation of approximately $170 million arising from non-contractual commercial negotiations and normal contractual supplier commodity pass-through arrangements with the company's suppliers.
gross profit and gross margin were $2,568 million and 18.1%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to $2,369 million and 18.7%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2022. the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the factors discussed above.

1        in 2023, the company recognized a discrete tax benefit of approximately $19 million related to the resolution of tax audits and reductions in certain unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest related to matters for which the statute of limitations had lapsed. in addition, the company recognized a discrete tax benefit of approximately $50 million related to the spin-off, a discrete tax benefit of approximately $30 million due to various changes in filling positions for prior years, and a discrete tax expense of approximately $79 million for changes in judgement on the recovery of certain deferred tax assets. during the year ended december 31, 2022, the company recognized discrete tax benefits of $23 million, primarily related to a reduction in certain unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest for a matter in which the statute of limitations had lapsed.
results by reportable segment the company's business is aggregated into three reportable segments: air management, drivetrain & battery systems and epropulsion. these segments are strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems. in previous years, the company presented its results under four reportable segments: air management, epropulsion & drivetrain, fuel systems and aftermarket. in the first quarter of 2023, the company elected to disaggregate air management and epropulsion & drivetrain segments into air management, drivetrain & battery systems and epropulsion and reported its results in a total of five reportable segments: air management, drivetrain & battery systems, epropulsion, fuel systems and aftermarket. as a result of the spin-off, fuel systems and aftermarket are no longer reportable segments.
segment adjusted operating income (loss) is the measure of segment income or loss used by the company. segment adjusted operating income (loss) is comprised of operating income adjusted for restructuring, merger, acquisition and divestiture expense, intangible asset amortization expense, impairment charges and other items not reflective of ongoing operating income or loss. the company believes segment adjusted operating income (loss) is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of its reportable segments.
segment adjusted operating income excludes certain corporate costs, which primarily represent headquarters' expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments. corporate expenses not allocated to segment adjusted operating income were $278 million and $282 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the decrease in corporate expenses in 2023 is primarily related to cost savings realized post phinia spin-off.

the air management segment's net sales for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $696 million, or 10%, and segment adjusted operating income increased $98 million from the year ended december 31, 2022. foreign currencies resulted in a year-over-year decrease in sales of approximately $6 million, primarily due to the weakening of the chinese renminbi and korean won, partially offset by the strengthening of the euro, in each case relative to the u.s. dollar. acquisitions contributed $25 million in additional sales during the year ended december 31, 2023. the increase excluding the impact of foreign currencies was primarily due to approximately $596 million of volume, mix and net new business driven by increased demand for the company's products and higher weighted average market production compared to the prior year, non-contractual commercial negotiations and normal contractual customer commodity pass-through arrangements with the company's customers. segment adjusted operating margin was 14.9% for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to 15.0% in the year ended december 31, 2022. the segment adjusted operating margin decrease was primarily due to the impacts of charging business losses.
the drivetrain & battery systems segment's net sales for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $613 million, or 16%, and segment adjusted operating income increased $96 million from the year ended december 31, 2022. foreign currencies resulted in a year-over-year decrease in sales of approximately $17 million, primarily due to the weakening of the chinese renminbi, partially offset by the strengthening of the euro, in each case relative to the u.s. dollar. the increase excluding these items was primarily due to approximately $604 million of volume, mix and net new business driven by increased demand for the company's products and higher weighted average market production compared to the prior year, non-contractual commercial negotiations and normal contractual customer commodity pass-through arrangements with the company's customers. segment adjusted operating margin was 12.5% in the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to 12.0% in the year ended december 31, 2022. the segment adjusted operating margin increase was primarily due to conversion on higher sales and customer recoveries, partially offset by higher costs due to inflation and battery systems business losses.
the epropulsion segment's net sales for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $260 million, or 14%, and segment adjusted operating loss increased $2 million from the year ended december 31, 2022. foreign currencies resulted in a year-over-year decrease in sales of approximately $43 million, primarily due to the weakening of the chinese renminbi relative to the u.s. dollar. acquisitions contributed $28 million in additional sales during the year ended december 31, 2023. the increase excluding the impact of foreign currencies was primarily due to approximately $224 million of volume, mix and net new business driven by higher weighted average market production compared to the prior year, non-contractual commercial negotiations and normal contractual customer commodity pass-through arrangements with the company's customers. segment adjusted operating margin was (4.2)% in the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to (4.6)% in the year ended december 31, 2022. the segment adjusted operating loss was primarily due to investments in r&d for eproducts. the segment adjusted operating margin was relatively flat as conversion on higher sales related to eproduct growth and customer recoveries were offset by higher r&d for eproducts, higher input costs due to inflation and additional depreciation expense.

net cash used in financing activities was $521 million during the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to $564 million in the year ended december 31, 2022. net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2023 was primarily related to the $177 million of borgwarner share repurchases, $130 million in dividends paid to the company's stockholders, $116 million in dividends paid to noncontrolling stockholders of the company's consolidated joint ventures and $23 million in contingent consideration payments. additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2023, the company used $15 million to purchase the noncontrolling interest related to seohanwarner turbo systems ltd. in korea. finally, during the year ended december 31, 2023, the company executed the spin-off and received a net distribution, part of which was utilized to purchase and extinguish a portion of senior notes due in 2025.
contractual obligations the company's significant cash requirements for contractual obligations as of december 31, 2023 primarily consisted of the principal and interest payments on its notes payable and long-term debt, non-cancelable lease obligations, capital spending obligations and purchase obligations. the principal amount of notes payable and long-term debt was $3,785 million as of december 31, 2023. the projected interest payments over the terms of that debt were $761 million as of december 31, 2023. refer to note 14, "notes payable and debt," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information.
as of december 31, 2023, non-cancelable lease obligations were $225 million. refer to note 22, "leases and commitments," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information. capital spending obligations were $148 million as of december 31, 2023.
on november 16, 2022, the company entered into a strategic partnership with wolfspeed in which the company invested $500 million in wolfspeed's convertible debt securities and simultaneously entered into an agreement under which wolfspeed agreed to provide a silicon carbide manufacturing capacity corridor to the company. under this agreement, beginning in 2024, the company will purchase silicon carbide parts with an aggregate total price equal to or greater than the corridor amount totaling a minimum of $184 million, annually through 2029. on september 21, 2023, and november 15, 2023, the company sold $100 million and the remaining $400 million, respectively, of the wolfspeed convertible debt securities. the silicone carbine parts agreement is independent of the sale of the convertible debt securities and remains effective as of december 31, 2023.
management believes that the combination of cash from operations, cash balances, available credit facilities, and the universal shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy the company's cash needs for its current level of operations and its planned operations for the foreseeable future. management will continue to balance the company's needs for organic growth, inorganic growth, debt reduction, cash conservation and return of cash to shareholders.
postretirement defined benefits the company's policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate. at december 31, 2023, all legal funding requirements had been met. the company contributed $21 million, $22 million and $24 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
the company expects to contribute a total of $20 million to $30 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2024. of the $20 million to $30 million in projected 2024 contributions, $6 million are contractually obligated, while any remaining payments would be discretionary.
the funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of $94 million and $173 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the decrease in the net unfunded position was a result of a lower projected benefit obligation, which was primarily due to discontinued operations and actuarial losses during the period. the main driver of these losses was the decrease of 0.70% in the weighted average discount rate for non-u.s. plans. of the total net unfunded amounts, $39 million and $34 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were related to plans in germany, where there is no tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans; hence, the common practice is to make contributions as benefit payments become due.
other postemployment benefits primarily consist of health care benefits for certain former employees and retirees of the company's u.s. operations. the company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. other postemployment benefits had an unfunded status of $33 million and $37 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
the company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future.
refer to note 18, "retirement benefit plans," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits.
other matters contingencies in the normal course of business, the company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, governmental investigations and related proceedings, general liability and other risks. it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. the company's management does not believe that adverse outcomes in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. an adverse outcome could, nonetheless, be material to the results of operations or cash flows.
environmental the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties ("prps") at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act ("superfund") and equivalent state laws and, as such, may be presently liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at 17 such sites. responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula.
the company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.
refer to note 21, "contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further details and information respecting the company's environmental liability.
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"). in preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. the company's most critical accounting policies are discussed below.
business combinations the company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. the excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities, including third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories, and actuaries for defined benefit retirement plans. goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the date of the related acquisition. if goodwill is assigned to more than one reporting unit, the company utilizes a method that is consistent with the manner in which the amount of goodwill in a business combination is determined. costs related to the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred.
acquired intangible assets include customer relationships, developed technology and trade names. the company estimates the fair value of acquired intangible assets using various valuation techniques. the primary valuation techniques used include forms of the income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings valuation methods. under these valuation approaches, the company is required to make estimates and assumptions from a market participant perspective, which may include revenue growth rates, estimated earnings, royalty rates, obsolescence factors, contributory asset charges, customer attrition and discount rates. under the multi-period excess earnings method, value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the asset, in excess of the returns required on the investment in contributory assets that are necessary to realize those benefits. the intangible asset's estimated earnings are determined as the residual earnings after quantifying estimated earnings from contributory assets. when the company estimates fair value using the relief-from-royalty method, it calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the assets. assumed royalty rates are applied to projected revenue for the remaining useful lives of the assets to estimate the royalty savings.
while the company uses its best estimates and assumptions, fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings.
future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in acquisition valuations and intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing, including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. an increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect the company's financial statements in any given year.
impairment of long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other amortizing intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review under asc topic 360. in assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. in assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management generally considers individual facilities to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent. a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event. if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis. management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost approach. if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations. significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include (i) an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review; (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset; and (iii) fair valuation of the asset. events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of long-lived assets include changes in the industries in which the company operates, particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy, as well as competition and advances in technology, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term sales or profitability.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets  during the fourth quarter of each year, the company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative assessment or a quantitative analysis. the qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting unit's fair value. using this qualitative assessment, the company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value. if it is determined that it is not more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds the carrying value, or upon consideration of other factors, including recent acquisition, restructuring or disposal activity or to refresh the fair values, the company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. in addition, the company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
the company performs a quantitative analysis on each reporting unit to refresh its respective fair value using a combined income and market approach. the market approach is based on market multiples (revenue and "ebitda", defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and requires an estimate of appropriate multiples based on market data for comparable companies. the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the company's facts and circumstances.
the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value are reasonable. different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. the primary assumptions affecting the company's 2023 goodwill quantitative impairment review are as follows:
•discount rates: the company used a range of 12.5% to 14.5% weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") as the discount rates for future cash flows. the wacc is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant.
•operating income margin: the company used historical and expected operating income margins, which may vary based on the projections of the reporting unit being evaluated.
•revenue growth rates: the company used a global automotive market industry growth rate forecast adjusted to estimate its own market participation for product lines.
in addition to the above primary assumptions, the company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models:
•the automotive industry is cyclical, and the company's results of operations could be adversely affected by industry downturns.
•the automotive industry is evolving, and if the company does not respond appropriately, its results of operations could be adversely affected.
•the company is dependent on market segments that use its key products and could be affected by decreasing demand in those segments.
•the company is subject to risks related to international operations.
based on the assumptions outlined above, the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023 indicated the company's goodwill assigned to the respective reporting units was not impaired. future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates from those used in acquisition-related valuations and goodwill impairment testing, including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. due to the company's recent acquisitions, there is less headroom (the difference between the carrying value and the fair value) associated with certain of the company's reporting units. based on the impairment testing conducted in 2023, the amounts by which the estimated fair values of the company's goodwill reporting units exceeded their carrying values ranged from 22% to 139%. an increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect the company's financial statements in any given year.
similar to goodwill, the company can elect to perform the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trade names) using a qualitative analysis, considering similar factors as outlined in the goodwill discussion, in order to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the trade names is less than the respective carrying values. if the company elects to perform or is required to perform a quantitative analysis, the test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. the company estimates the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief-from-royalty method, which it believes is an appropriate and widely used valuation technique for such assets. the fair value derived from the relief-from-royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trade names and not being required to pay a royalty for their use.
refer to note 12, "goodwill and other intangibles," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding goodwill.
product warranties the company provides warranties on some, but not all, of its products. the warranty terms are typically from one to three years. provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. these estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. costs of product recalls, which may include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer's cost of the recall, including labor to remove and replace the recalled part, are accrued as part of the company's warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, if actual claims incurred differ from the original estimates or there are changes in our assumptions, it could materially affect the company's financial statements.
at december 31, 2023, the total accrued warranty liability was $196 million. the accrual is represented as $91 million in other current liabilities and $105 million in other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
refer to note 13, "product warranty," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding product warranties.
postretirement defined benefits the company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees. costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and other postemployment health care expenses for former employees, retirees and surviving spouses and dependents.
the company's defined benefit pension and other postemployment benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715. the determination of the company's obligation and expense for its pension and other postemployment benefits, such as retiree health care, is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note 18, "retirement benefit plans," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report. the effects of any modification to those assumptions, or actual results that differ from assumptions used, are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap.
the primary assumptions affecting the company's accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31, 2023 are as follows:
•expected long-term rate of return on plan assets: the expected long-term rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost. the required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. over time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long-term returns. the expected long-term rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs, including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the company's trusts and its asset allocation, as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return, inflation and other variables. the company also considers the impact of active management of the plans' invested assets. in determining its pension expense for the year ended december 31, 2023, the company used long-term rates of return on plan assets ranging from 1.3% to 12% outside of the u.s. and 5% in the u.s.
actual returns on u.s. pension assets were 5.2 % and (17.9)% for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumptions of 5% and 4.8%, respectively, for the same years ended.
actual returns on u.k. pension assets were 3.2% and (34.8)% for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 5.3% and 4.1%, respectively, for the same years ended.
actual returns on german pension assets were 9.9% and (19.7)% for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumptions of 4.5% and 4.0%, respectively, for the same years ended.
•discount rate: the discount rate is used to calculate pension and other postemployment benefit ("opeb") obligations. in determining the discount rate, the company utilizes a full-yield approach in the estimation of service and interest components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. for its significant plans, the company used discount rates ranging from 1.8% to 11.8% to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of december 31, 2023, including weighted average discount rates of 5.1% in the u.s., 4.2% outside of the u.s. (including 4.6% in the u.k.) and 5.1% for u.s. other postemployment health care plans. the u.s. and u.k. discount rates reflect the fact that the u.s. and u.k. pension plans have been closed for new participants.
•health care cost trend: for postemployment employee health care plan accounting, the company reviews external data and company-specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions. in determining the projected benefit obligation for postemployment health care plans as of december 31, 2023, the company used health care cost trend rates of 6.3%, declining to an ultimate trend rate of 4.75% by the year 2026.
while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company's pension and opeb and its future expense.
the sensitivity to a 25 basis-point change in the assumptions for discount rate and expected return on assets related to 2024 pre-tax pension expense for company sponsored u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans is expected to be negligible.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in discount rate for company sponsored u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans on its pension obligations:

restructuring restructuring costs may occur when the company takes action to exit or significantly curtail a part of its operations or implements a reorganization that affects the nature and focus of operations. a restructuring charge can consist of severance costs associated with reductions to the workforce, costs to terminate an operating lease or contract, professional fees and other costs incurred related to the implementation of restructuring activities.
the company generally records costs associated with voluntary separations at the time of employee acceptance. costs for involuntary separation programs are recorded when management has approved the plan for separation, the employees are identified and aware of the benefits they are entitled to and it is unlikely that the plan will change significantly. when a plan of separation requires approval by or consultation with the relevant labor organization or government, the costs are recorded upon agreement. costs associated with benefits that are contingent on the employee continuing to provide service are expensed over the required service period.
income taxes  the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
accounting for income taxes is complex, in part because the company conducts business globally and, therefore, files income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions. management judgment is required in determining the company's worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities, including accruals for unrecognized tax benefits and assessing the need for valuation allowances. in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the company's valuation allowance may be necessary.
the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. at the federal and state level and numerous non-u.s. jurisdictions. the determination of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits includes the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions across the company's global operations. management judgment is required in determining the accruals for unrecognized tax benefits. in the ordinary course of the company's business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are established when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. the company has certain u.s. state income tax returns and certain non-u.s. income tax returns that are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities. at december 31, 2023, the company had a liability for tax positions the company estimates are not more-likely-than-not to be sustained based on the technical merits, which is included in other non-current liabilities. nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.
the company records valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of certain deferred tax assets to amounts that it expects are more-likely-than-not to be realized. existing deferred tax assets, net operating losses and tax credits by jurisdiction and expectations of the ability to utilize these tax attributes are assessed through a review of past, current and estimated future taxable income and tax planning strategies.
estimates of future taxable income, including income generated from prudent and feasible tax planning strategies resulting from actual or planned business and operational developments, could change in the near term, perhaps materially, which may require the company to consider any potential impact to the assessment of the recoverability of the related deferred tax asset. such potential impact could be material to the company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations for an individual reporting period.
in future periods, the company's effective tax rate and tax liability may be impacted due to changes in u.s. and non-u.s. tax laws and as a result of regulatory or legislative developments related to such laws. this could include u.s. and non-u.s. tax law developments related to changes to long-standing tax principles arising from proposals made by the organization for economic co-operation and development that seek to allocate greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and establish a global minimum tax rate of at least 15%.

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. the company is also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in its manufacturing operations. some of its commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers. other commodity purchase price risk is occasionally addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward contracts. the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. the company does not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks.
the company has established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk. for quantitative disclosures about market risk, refer to note 17, "financial instruments," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity purchase price risk.
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. the company manages its interest rate risk by monitoring its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs. the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). at december 31, 2023, all of the company's long-term debt had fixed interest rates.
foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that the company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. currently, the company's most significant currency exposures relate to the brazilian real, british pound, chinese renminbi, euro, korean won, mexican peso, polish zloty, singapore dollar and thailand baht. the company mitigates its foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets it serves, by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of its investments in foreign markets through local currency loans. the company also monitors its foreign currency exposure in each country and implements strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. in addition, the company regularly enters into forward currency contracts, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency-denominated debt designated as net investment hedges to reduce exposure to translation exchange rate risk. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the company recorded a deferred gain of $112 million and $196 million, respectively, both before taxes, for designated net investment hedges within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
the significant foreign currency translation adjustments, including the impact of the net investment hedges discussed above, during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, are shown in the following table, which provides the percentage change in u.s. dollars against the respective currencies and the approximate impacts of these changes recorded within other comprehensive income (loss) for the respective periods.

item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements this report contains some predictive statements about future events, including statements related to conditions in domestic or global economies, conditions in steel, aluminum, and recycled metals market places, steel dynamics' revenues, costs of purchased materials, future profitability and earnings, and the operation of new, existing or planned facilities. these statements, which we generally precede or accompany by such typical conditional words as "anticipate", "intend", "believe", "estimate", "plan", "seek", "project", or "expect", or by the words "may", "will", or "should", are intended to be made as "forward-looking", subject to many risks and uncertainties, within the safe harbor protections of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements speak only as of this date and are based upon information and assumptions, which we consider reasonable as of this date, concerning our businesses and the environments in which they operate. such predictive statements are not guarantees of future performance, and we undertake no duty to update or revise any such statements. some factors that could cause such forward-looking statements to turn out differently than anticipated include: (1) domestic and global economic factors; (2) global steelmaking overcapacity and imports of steel, together with increased scrap prices; (3) pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues; (4) the cyclical nature of the steel industry and the industries we serve; (5) volatility and major fluctuations in prices and availability of scrap metal, scrap substitutes and supplies, and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers; (6) cost and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil, and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions; (7) increased environmental, greenhouse gas emissions and sustainability considerations from our customers or related regulations; (8) compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements; (9) significant price and other forms of competition from other steel and aluminum producers, scrap processors and alternative materials; (10) availability of an adequate source of supply of scrap for our metals recycling operations; (11) cybersecurity threats and risks to the security of our sensitive data and information technology; (12) the implementation of our growth strategy; (13) litigation and legal compliance; (14) unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns; (15) governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits; (16) our senior unsecured credit facility contains, and any future financing agreements may contain, restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility; and (17) the impacts of impairment charges.
more specifically, we refer you to our more detailed explanation of these and other factors and risks that may cause such predictive statements to turn out differently, as set forth in the sections titled special note regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of part i of this report and item 1a. risk factors, as well as in other subsequent reports we file with the securities and exchange commission. these reports are available publicly on the securities and exchange commission website, www.sec.gov, and on our website, www.steeldynamics.com under "investors - sec filings."
operating statement classifications net sales. net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped, product mix and related pricing. we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel, product dimensions, certain smaller volumes, and for value-added processing or coating of our steel products. except for the steel fabrication operations, we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns and claims from these sales at the point in time control of the product transfers to the customer, upon shipment or delivery. our steel fabrication operations recognize revenues over time based on completed fabricated tons to date as a percentage of total tons required for each contract.
costs of goods sold. our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products. the principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes (which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold), steel substrate, direct and indirect labor and related benefits, alloys, zinc, transportation and freight, repairs and maintenance, utilities such as electricity and natural gas, and depreciation.
39
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales, finance and accounting, and administrative departments, including, among other items, labor and related benefits, and professional services.
companywide profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets are each separately presented in the statement of income.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest. interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt, net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects.
other (income) expense, net. other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash deposits, short-term and other investments, and any other non-operating income activity, including income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method. other expense consists of any non-operating costs, such as certain acquisition and financing expenses.
2023 overview during 2023, underlying domestic steel demand was firm, supported by the construction, automotive, and energy sectors. customer steel inventories also remained below historical averages, in combination resulting in generally steady order patterns. this solid market environment, coupled with the continued ramp-up of sinton, drove record annual shipments of 12.8 million tons for our steel operations. despite a challenging pricing environment throughout much of the year, our metals recycling teams meaningfully increased volume during 2023 compared to 2022. our steel fabrication business achieved its second highest annual earnings during 2023, on continued solid non-residential construction demand. our consolidated net sales of $18.8 billion and cash flow from operations of $3.5 billion were our second-best and our consolidated operating income of $3.2 billion was our third-best performance in company history. metal spread compression among each of our operating segments resulted in significantly lower operating income in 2023 compared to our record 2022 earnings despite continued strong market demand and volumes.
consolidated operating income for 2023 decreased $1.9 billion, or 38%, to $3.2 billion, compared to a record $5.1 billion in 2022. net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. for 2023 decreased $1.4 billion, or 37%, to $2.5 billion, compared to a record in 2022. diluted earnings per share attributable to steel dynamics, inc. was $14.64 for 2023, compared to $20.92 for 2022.
effective the fourth quarter 2023, the company changed its reportable segments, consistent with how it currently manages the business, representing four reporting segments: steel operations (now including warehouse operations previously included in other), metals recycling operations, steel fabrication operations, and a new reportable segment, aluminum operations. segment information provided within this form 10-k has been recast for all prior periods consistent with the current reportable segment presentation. aluminum operations includes the results of the recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill in columbus, mississippi, and two satellite recycled aluminum slab centers located in arizona and mexico, all of which are currently being constructed. the results of this segment currently consist of construction and start-up costs recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, included within the discussion of consolidated results within the other operations section below. during 2023, there were no additional results of operations, such as those related to shipments or production, to be discussed. operations are expected to begin in 2025.
refer to item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for additional information regarding results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, and segment operating results for 2022 as compared to 2021. our 2023 change in reportable segments did not change the discussion previously provided.

segment results 2023 vs. 2022
during 2023, our steel operations achieved record annual shipments of 12.8 million tons (11.4 million excluding intra-segment) a 5% increase over 2022 shipments, including 1.4 million tons from sinton during 2023, an increase of 67% over 2022. customer order activity and steel demand were strong during 2023, with the construction, automotive, industrial, and energy sectors continuing to lead demand. in spite of strong market demand, average selling prices were lower during 2023 compared to 2022, as total steel segment average selling prices decreased 18%, or $249 per ton, compared to 2022. sheet steel pricing was 22% lower, while long products pricing decreased 6%. net sales for the steel operations segment were 13% lower in 2023 when compared to historically high prices in 2022, due to lower average steel selling prices more than offsetting record volumes.
metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost, generally comprising approximately 55% to 65% of our steel mill operations' manufacturing costs. our metallic raw material cost consumed in our steel mills decreased $61 per net ton, or 13%, in 2023 compared to 2022, consistent with overall decreased domestic scrap pricing noted below in the metals recycling operations segment discussion.
as a result of average selling prices decreasing more than scrap costs, specifically for sheet steel products, metal spread (which we define as the difference between average steel mill selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed in our steel mills) decreased 20% in 2023 compared to 2022. due to this metal spread compression, operating income for the steel operations decreased 39%, to $1.9 billion, in 2023 compared to 2022.
43
metals recycling operations segment

metals recycling operations includes both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing, transportation, marketing, brokerage, and scrap management services. our steel mills utilize a large portion of the ferrous scrap sold by our metals recycling operations as raw material in our steelmaking operations, and the remainder is sold to other consumers, such as other steel manufacturers and foundries. in 2023 and 2022, 62% and 66%, respectively, of metals recycling operations ferrous scrap was sold to our own steel mills, while our steel mill utilization was 82% and 77% including sinton (91% and 92% exclusive of sinton) in 2023 and 2022, respectively. metals recycling operations accounted for 12% and 10% of our consolidated net sales during 2023 and 2022, respectively.

segment results 2023 vs. 2022
during 2023, our metals recycling operations continued to benefit from solid domestic steel industry demand, resulting in higher ferrous and nonferrous scrap shipments compared to 2022. we were able to increase shipments even as domestic steel mill utilization rates declined slightly to approximately 75% in 2023, as compared to approximately 78% in 2022. ferrous and nonferrous shipments increased 9% and 5%, respectively, in 2023 compared to 2022. net sales for our metals recycling operations in 2023 were comparable to 2022, as increased shipments were offset by ferrous and nonferrous average selling prices that decreased 7% and 8%, respectively, during 2023 compared to 2022.
ferrous metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap) decreased 7% and nonferrous metal spread increased 9% during 2023 compared to 2022. as a result of the overall decreased metals spreads, metals recycling operations operating income decreased 24% to $88.7 million in 2023 compared to 2022.

steel fabrication operations segment

steel fabrication operations include seven new millennium building systems joist and deck plants located throughout the united states, and in northern mexico. revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses, girders, steel joists, and steel deck used within the non-residential construction industry. steel fabrication operations accounted for 15% and 19% of our consolidated net sales during 2023 and 2022, respectively.
segment results 2023 vs. 2022
our steel fabrication operations continue to benefit from the solid non-residential construction market, as evidenced by our historically strong order backlog that extends through the first half of 2024. the continued onshoring of manufacturing, coupled with the robust u.s. infrastructure and inflation reduction act programs and industrial construction, supports consistent strong demand. net sales for the steel fabrication operations decreased 34% during 2023 compared to the record levels during 2022, as average selling prices decreased $740 per ton, or 15%, and volumes decreased 23% from the record volume during 2022.
the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations, historically representing approximately two-thirds of the total cost of manufacturing. the average cost of steel consumed decreased 26% in 2023, as compared to 2022. due to decreased selling prices per ton more than offsetting decreased steel input costs per ton, metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased steel) contracted 10% in 2023 compared to 2022. metal spread compression coupled with decreased volume resulted in operating income decreasing 34% to $1.6 billion in 2023, compared to $2.4 billion in 2022.
45
other operations

consolidated results 2023 vs. 2022
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses of $588.6 million during 2023 increased 8% from $545.6 million during 2022 primarily due to a 10% increase in payroll and benefits expense related to the execution of our growth strategy during 2023, including construction and start-up costs of our aluminum operations. selling, general and administrative expenses represented 3.1% and 2.5% of net sales during 2023 and 2022, respectively.
companywide profit sharing expense during 2023 of $272.0 million decreased 40% from $452.6 million during 2022, consistent with decreased pretax earnings. refer to note 11. retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for further information.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest. during 2023, interest expense of $76.5 million decreased 16% from $91.5 million during 2022, due to higher capitalized interest in 2023 ($33.0 million, compared to $15.8 million in 2022) related to our ongoing expansion projects, most notably within aluminum operations.
other (income) expense, net.  net other income was $144.2 million in 2023, compared to $20.8 million in 2022, due primarily to an increase in interest income of $88.2 million associated with an increase in invested balances and an increase in yield earned on our invested cash and short-term investments in 2023.
income tax expense. during 2023, income tax expense of $751.6 million, at an effective income tax rate of 23.3%, decreased 34% compared to the $1.1 billion, at an effective income tax rate of 22.7%, during 2022, consistent with decreased pretax earnings. refer to note 4. income taxes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information.
included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2023, are potential benefits of $27.8 million that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a net-of-tax basis in income tax expense. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recognized expense from the increase of interest expense and penalties of $1.6 million, net of tax. in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, we had $3.2 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31, 2023.
we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions. the tax years 2020 through 2022 remain open to examination by the internal revenue service and various state and local jurisdictions. at this time, we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months in an amount ranging from zero to $10.0 million, as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations and other federal and state income tax audits.
46
liquidity and capital resources capital resources and long-term debt. our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for, among other things, the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our operations, and to remain in compliance with environmental laws. our short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, including expansion projects, principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, dividends to our shareholders, and potential stock repurchases and acquisitions or investments. we have met and intend to continue to meet these liquidity requirements primarily with available cash and cash provided by operations, long-term borrowings, and we also have availability under our unsecured revolver. our liquidity at december 31, 2023, is as follows (in thousands):

cash and equivalents                   $1,400,887
short-term and other investments                 951,873
unsecured revolver availability                1,190,873
total liquidity                        $3,543,633
our total outstanding debt of $3.1 billion is consistent with our total outstanding debt at december 31, 2022. our total long-term debt to capitalization ratio (representing our long-term debt, including current maturities, divided by the sum of our long-term debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and our total stockholders' equity) was 25.8% and 27.7% at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively.
in the third quarter of 2023, we entered into a new unsecured credit agreement, replacing the previous one, which has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (facility), which provides a $1.2 billion revolver and matures in july 2028. subject to certain conditions, we have the ability to increase the facility size by $500.0 million. the unsecured revolver is available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability to incur indebtedness and permit liens on certain assets. our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the unsecured revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants. at december 31, 2023, we had $1.2 billion of availability on the revolver, $9.1 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability, and there were no borrowings outstanding.
the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50:1.00. our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our last-twelve-months (ltm) consolidated adjusted ebitda as defined in the facility (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other non-cash transactions as defined in the facility) by our ltm gross interest expense, less amortization of financing fees. in addition, a debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 0.60:1.00 must be maintained. at december 31, 2023, our interest coverage ratio and debt to capitalization ratio were 36.13:1.00 and 0.26:1.00, respectively. we were, therefore, in compliance with these covenants at december 31, 2023, and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months.
working capital (representing excess of current assets over current liabilities). we generated cash flow from operations of $3.5 billion in 2023 compared to $4.5 billion in 2022. working capital decreased $1.2 billion, or 21%, during 2023 to $4.5 billion at december 31, 2023, due primarily to our accounts receivable and inventories decreasing $683.1 million, or 13%, compared to december 31, 2022, due to lower sales and inventory values in 2023. in addition, our $400 million 2.800% senior notes were recorded as current at december 31, 2023.
47
capital investments. during 2023, we invested $1.7 billion in property, plant and equipment, primarily within our aluminum operations and steel operations segments, compared with $908.9 million invested during 2022. we are currently executing our plan to invest $2.7 billion in a new state-of-the-art low-carbon recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill with two supporting satellite recycled aluminum slab centers, which is planned to be funded by available cash and cash flow from operations. related expenditures began in the third quarter of 2022 and are expected to continue through early 2025. our liquidity of $3.5 billion and anticipated future operating cash flow generation is sufficient to provide for our planned 2024 capital requirements.
cash dividends. as a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation capability and financial position, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 25% to $0.425 per share in the first quarter of 2023, and continued at that level through the remainder of 2023 (from $0.34 per share in 2022), resulting in declared cash dividends of $280.5 million during 2023, compared to $245.3 million during 2022. we paid cash dividends of $271.3 million and $237.2 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively. our board of directors, along with executive management, approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors, after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, outstanding indebtedness, current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans.
other. our board of directors has authorized share repurchase programs during prior years, the most recent of which occurred in november 2023 for a program of up to $1.5 billion of the company's common stock. under the share repurchase programs, purchases take place as and when we determine in open market or private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities or growth projects, our cash flows from operations, and general economic conditions. the share repurchase programs do not require us to acquire any specific number of shares, and may be modified, suspended, extended, or terminated by us at any time. the share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date. there were $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion of share repurchases during 2023 and 2022, respectively. as of december 31, 2023, we had $1.4 billion remaining available to purchase under the november 2023 share repurchase program. see part ii, item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information.
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will depend upon general economic, financial, and business conditions, along with competition, legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control. in addition, we cannot assure that our operating results, cash flows, access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flows from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including borrowings under our facility, if necessary, will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, funding working capital requirements, and funding anticipated capital expenditures.
contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations, including purchase obligations, as defined by the securities and exchange commission. a "purchase obligation" is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
long-term debt and estimated interest. refer to note 3. long-term debt to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for our long-term debt maturities. estimated interest payments on our senior unsecured notes were determined based on their outstanding balances through maturity at their contractual interest rates, as detailed in note 3. estimated interest payments also include a 0.15% commitment fee on our available revolver, and an average interest rate of 7.0% on our other debt of $61.8 million. our estimated interest payments are $102.2 million, $80.1 million, $74.9 million, $54.5 million, $50.0 million, for the years 2024 through 2028, respectively, and $343.2 million thereafter.

purchase obligations. we have commitments for the purchase of commodities such as electricity, water, natural gas and its transportation services, fuel, air products, zinc, and electrodes. refer to note 9. commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.
construction commitments. we have firm contracts with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31, 2023. refer to note 9. commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.
lease commitments. we have entered into operating leases relating principally to transportation and other equipment, and some real estate. refer to note 12. leases to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.
unrecognized tax benefits. we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits; however, due to the uncertainty of the timing, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. refer to note 4. income taxes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.
other matters environmental and other contingencies we have incurred, and in the future will continue to incur, capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control, remediation, monitoring and compliance. during 2023, we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately $54.6 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately $5.4 million. of the costs incurred during 2023 for monitoring and compliance, approximately 71% were related to the normal transportation of certain types of by-products produced in our steelmaking processes and other facilities, in accordance with legal requirements. we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately $3.1 million at all of our facilities during 2023. we have an accrual of $6.6 million recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations, and $2.6 million related to our idled minnesota ironmaking operations. we believe, apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, environmental laws and regulations evolve and change, and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future, such as the impact of various governmental legislatures and agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change.
critical accounting estimates management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. we review the accounting estimates we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

impairments of long-lived tangible and definite-lived intangible assets. we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amounts. the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary, including by way of examples, a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and/or projected cash flows, significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete, our strategy and capital planning, and the economic environment in markets to be served. when determining future cash flows and if necessary, fair value, we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate. there were no indicators of impairment or impairment charges recorded during 2023, 2022, of 2021.
goodwill.
our goodwill, relating to various business combinations, consisted of the following at december 31 (in thousands):

2023                 2022
steel operations segment                   $272,133             $272,133
metals recycling operations segment               203,413              228,009
steel fabrication operations segment                1,925                1,925
$477,471             $502,067
at least once annually (as of october 1), or when indicators of impairment exist, the company performs an impairment test for goodwill. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally one level below the company's operating segments. the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a complex valuation model including an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows (income approach), and for some years by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies, using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit, there is no impairment. if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method (income approach) include: (a) expected cash flows for the five-year period following the testing date (including market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce and estimated capital needs); (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; and (c) a risk-adjusted discount rate based on management's best estimate of market participants' after-tax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums. key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate.
goodwill acquired in past transactions is naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition. consequently, if operating results and/or economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired asset. a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. additionally, we are required

to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. as a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed. therefore, we may recognize an impairment in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts. accordingly, discount rate scenario analysis is performed to evaluate the impact on estimated reporting unit fair values.
our fourth quarter 2023, 2022, and 2021 annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges. management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail the goodwill impairment test in the near term, as the determined fair value of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value by more than an insignificant amount. changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate, could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill.
income taxes. we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. we also establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. we adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved. the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. a tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears. settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.

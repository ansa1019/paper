item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business we are a leading developer, publisher, and marketer of interactive entertainment for consumers around the globe. we develop, operate, and publish products principally through rockstar games, 2k, private division, and zynga. our products are currently designed for console gaming systems, pc, and mobile, including smartphones and tablets. we deliver our products through physical retail, digital download, online platforms, and cloud streaming services. refer to item 1 - business for additional discussion.
impairments during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $2,342.1, representing a partial impairment related to one of our reporting units, and we recognized impairment charges of $577.4 for acquisition-related developed game technology intangible assets within cost of revenue as a result of a reduction in the forecasted performance of certain games due to industry conditions and changes in our strategies in response to those conditions. key assumptions and estimates used in deriving the fair values of these assets are forecasted revenue, ebitda margins, long-term decay rate, and discount rate (refer to note 9 - goodwill and intangible assets, net). future changes in those key assumptions and estimates could result in additional impairments.
during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024, we also recognized impairment charges related to our software development costs and licenses of $109.9, of which $88.2 related to title cancellations as part of our cost reduction program (refer to note 7 - software development costs and licenses and note 21 - business reorganization).
debt transactions on april 14, 2023, we completed our offering and sale of $1,000.0 aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, consisting of $500.0 principal amount of our 5.000% senior notes due 2026 (the "2026 notes") and $500.0 principal amount of our 4.950% senior notes due 2028 ("the 2028 notes"). on january 8, 2024, we completed our add-on offering and sale of $350.0 aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, consisting of $50.0 principal amount of additional 2026 notes and $300.0 principal amount of additional 2028 notes. the additional 2026 notes and additional 2028 notes (the "new notes") were issued as additional notes under the existing indenture (refer to note 11 - debt).
our senior notes are the company's senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsubordinated obligations. we will pay interest on the 2026 notes and 2028 notes semi-annually on march 28 and september 28 of each year, commencing september 28, 2023 for the 2026 notes and 2028 notes. during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024, we made interest payments of $137.0 for our various debt obligations.
on june 5, 2023, pursuant to a tender offer, we purchased and retired $650.0 in aggregate principal amount of our 3.300% senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 notes"), with proceeds received from the 2026 notes and 2028 notes. we repaid the remaining $350.0 of principal amount of our 2024 notes on their maturity date on march 28, 2024, with proceeds received from the issuance of the new notes. during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024, we recognized a debt extinguishment gain of approximately $7.7, net of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs recorded within interest and other, net in our consolidated statement of operations.
trends and factors affecting our business product release schedule.    our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of our titles. generally, a significant portion of our revenue has been derived from a few popular franchises, particularly around new releases within those franchises, some of which have annual or biennial releases. our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenue. sales of grand theft auto products generated 14.7% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024. the timing of our grand theft auto product releases may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis.
economic environment and retailer performance.    we continue to monitor various macroeconomic and geopolitical factors that may affect our business in several areas, including consumer demand, inflation, pricing pressure on our products, credit quality of our receivables, and foreign currency exchange rates. for example, in response to the conflict in ukraine, we suspended sales of our products in russia and belarus, which had a negative impact on our financial results. actions taken to date and other potential actions could result in additional negative impact in future periods.
the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future. there has been increased consolidation in our industry, as larger, better capitalized competitors will be in a stronger position to withstand prolonged periods of economic downturn and sustain their business through the financial volatility. also, bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business, due to uncollectible accounts receivable and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers.
hardware platforms.    we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game consoles manufactured by third parties. such console revenue comprised 40.5% of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024. the success of our business is dependent upon consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms. when new hardware platforms are introduced, demand for interactive entertainment used on older platforms typically declines, which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles. the latest sony and microsoft consoles provide "backwards compatibility" (i.e., the ability to play games for the previous generation of consoles). the inclusion of such features on new consoles could mitigate the risk of such a decline. however, we cannot be certain how backwards compatibility will affect demand for our products. further, events beyond our control may impact the availability of these new consoles, which may also affect demand. we manage our product delivery on each current and future platform in a manner we believe to be most effective to maximize our revenue opportunities and achieve the desired return on our investments in product development. accordingly, our strategy for these platforms is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles.
online content and digital distribution.    we provide a variety of online delivered products, including direct digital downloads of our titles, and access to additional offerings through virtual currency, add-on content, and in-game purchases, which drive ongoing engagement and incremental revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles. net revenue from digital online channels comprised 95.6% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024. we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to continue to be the primary part of our business over the long term.
a significant portion of our mobile titles are distributed, marketed, and promoted through third parties, primarily apple's app store and the google play store. virtual items for our mobile games are purchased through the payment processing systems of these platform providers. we generate a significant portion of our net revenue through the apple and google platforms and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. apple and google generally have the discretion to set the amounts of their platform fees and change their platforms' terms of service and other policies with respect to us or other developers at their sole discretion, and those changes may be unfavorable to us. these platform fees are recorded as cost of revenue as incurred. further, as a result of the platform fees associated with online game sales, our mobile net revenue generally generates a lower gross margin percentage than our console or pc revenue. accordingly, the overall product mix between mobile and other game sales may affect our gross margin percentage. we are also expanding our direct-to-consumer efforts more meaningfully across our mobile portfolio to enhance profitability.
in addition, we aim to drive ongoing engagement and incremental revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles through virtual currency, add-on content, in-game purchases, and in-game advertising, all of which are typically delivered digitally.
player acquisition costs.    principally for our mobile titles, we use advertising and other forms of player acquisition and retention to grow and retain our player audience. these expenditures, which are recorded within sales and marketing in our consolidated statements of operations, generally relate to the promotion of new game launches and ongoing performance-based programs to drive new player acquisition and lapsed player reactivation. over time, the effectiveness or cost of these acquisition and retention-related programs may change, affecting our operating results.
content release highlights during fiscal year 2024, 2k released wwe 2k24, lego 2k drive and nba 2k24; zynga released match factory! and top troops; and private division released penny's big breakaway.
during fiscal year 2025 to date, 2k released topspin 2k25 and private division released no rest for the wicked early access on pc. rockstar plans to release grand theft auto vi in the fall of calendar 2025.
in addition, throughout the year, we expect to continue to deliver new content for our franchises. we will also continue to invest in opportunities that we believe will enhance and scale our business and have the potential to drive growth over the long term.
fiscal 2024 financial summary our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024 was essentially flat year-on-year at $5,349.6, a decrease of $0.3 or 0.0% compared to the fiscal year ended march 31, 2023 and included net revenue of $2,390.9 from zynga, which we acquired in may 2022 (refer to note 20 - acquisitions), including top contributors toon blast, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, empires & puzzles, merge dragons!, and words with friends, as well as a variety of our top franchises, primarily nba 2k, grand theft auto, red dead redemption, and wwe 2k.
our operating loss for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024 was $3,590.6 compared to operating loss of $1,165.2 for fiscal year ended march 31, 2023, primarily due to goodwill impairment charges of $2,342.1, representing a partial impairment related to one of our reporting units. for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024, our net loss was $3,744.2, as compared to net loss of $1,124.7 in the prior year. diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024 was $22.01, as compared to diluted loss per share of $7.03 for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2023.
at march 31, 2024, we had $1,102.0 of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents, compared to $1,234.6 at march 31, 2023. the decrease was primarily due to net cash used in financing activities, primarily related to net share settlements of our restricted stock awards and payment of contingent earn-outs for prior acquisitions, partially offset by issuance of common stock and our net debt activity. the debt activity included proceeds from the issuance of 2026 notes and
2028 notes offset by our repayment of 2024 notes and term loan (refer to note 11 - debt). to a lesser extent, the decrease was also due to i) net cash used in investing activities, which was due primarily to the purchase of fixed assets and our individually immaterial acquisitions and investments, offset by our sales and maturities of available for sale securities, and ii) net cash used in operating activities, which was due primarily to investments in software development and licenses, partially offset by sales of our products.
critical accounting policies and estimates our most critical accounting policies, which are those that require significant judgment, include revenue recognition; capitalization and recognition of software development costs and licenses; fair value estimates including valuation of goodwill and intangible assets; valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation; and income taxes. see note 1 - basis of presentation and significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k.

operating metric net bookings we monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business. net bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically during the period and includes licensing fees, merchandise, in-game advertising, strategy guides, and publisher incentives. net bookings were as follows:

for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024, net bookings increased by $49.4 as compared to the prior year. the increase was primarily due to an increase in net bookings of $247.5 from zynga, which we acquired in may 2022 (refer to note 20 - acquisitions), including from our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, which benefited from our november 2022 acquisition of popcore (refer to note 20 - acquisitions), and our other top contributors toon blast, empires & puzzles, words with friends, and merge dragons!, as well as an increase in net bookings from our grand theft auto and red dead redemption franchises, including our august 2023 release of red dead redemption and undead nightmare. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in net bookings from tiny tina's wonderlands, which released in march 2022, the quarry, which released in june 2022, and our sid meier's civilization, pga tour 2k, the latest installment of which, pga tour 2k23 released in october 2022, and nba 2k franchises.

the effective tax rate in the current year was lower compared to the prior year primarily due to increased expense from nondeductible goodwill impairments, increased expense related to an increase in our valuation allowance, decreased benefits from tax credits, and the impact of geographic mix and foreign earnings.
the accounting for share-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depends on the stock price at the time of the employee award vesting.
we anticipate that additional excess tax benefits or shortfalls from employee stock compensation, tax credits, changes in valuation allowance, and changes in our geographic mix of earnings could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in the future. in addition, we are regularly examined by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. examinations may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes. we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law, and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments. it is possible that settlement of audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations could have an impact on our effective tax rate in future periods.
the american rescue plan act of 2021 (the "arpa"), among other things, includes provisions to expand the irc section 162(m) disallowance for deduction of certain compensation paid by publicly held corporations. effective for tax years starting after december 31, 2026 (april 1, 2027 for the company), arpa expands the limitation to cover the next five most highly compensated employees. arpa did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024. we continue to evaluate the potential impact arpa may have on our operations and consolidated financial statements in future periods.
the inflation reduction act of 2022 (the "inflation reduction act") includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (camt) of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (afsi) of corporations with an average afsi exceeding $1.0 billion over a consecutive three-year period. the camt was effective for taxable year ending march 31, 2024. it is possible that the camt could result in an additional tax liability over the regular federal corporate tax liability in a particular year based on differences between book and taxable income. we estimate no tax liability relating to the camt for the current fiscal year. we will continue to evaluate the potential impact the inflation reduction act may have on our operations and consolidated financial statements in future periods.
the organization for economic co-operation and development ("oecd") has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% of reported profits, referred to as pillar two. many countries have already implemented or are taking steps to implement pillar two. although the model rules provide a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact pillar two slightly differently than the model rules and on different timelines. many aspects of pillar two are effective for the fiscal year ending march 31, 2025. it is possible that pillar two could result in additional tax liability over the regular corporate tax liability in a particular jurisdiction to the extent tax expense is less than the 15% minimum rate. we will continue to evaluate the potential impact pillar two may have on our operations and consolidated financial statements in future periods.
switzerland's federal act on tax reform and avh financing ("traf") abolished preferential tax regimes for holding companies, domicile companies, and mixed companies at the cantonal level. the traf allows the cantons to establish transition rules, the implementation of which may be subject to a ruling from the canton. for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024, we recorded a net tax expense of $29.2 due to an increase in the valuation of allowance of $81.3 offset by an increase in the deferred tax asset of $52.1 relating to the swiss cantonal basis step-up, as it is more-likely-than-not that such deferred tax assets would not be realized.
as of march 31, 2024, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $276.3, of which $167.9 would affect our effective tax rate if realized. for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024, gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $18.5.
we are no longer subject to audit for u.s. federal income tax returns for periods prior to our fiscal year ended march 31, 2021 and state income tax returns for periods prior to the fiscal year ended march 31, 2020. with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to income tax examinations in non-u.s. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal year ended march 31, 2016. certain taxing authorities are currently examining our income tax returns for the fiscal years ended march 31, 2016 through march 31, 2022.
net loss and loss per share for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024, net loss was $3,744.2, as compared to a net loss of $1,124.7 in the prior year. basic and diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024 was $22.01, as compared to basic and diluted loss per share of $7.03 for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2023. basic weighted average shares of 170.1 were 10.2 higher due primarily to normal stock compensation activity, including vests as well as grants and forfeitures in the prior year being fully outstanding in the current year. see note 12 - (loss) earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are to fund (i) the development, manufacturing and marketing of our published products, (ii) working capital, (iii) capital expenditures, (iv) debt and interest payments, (v) tax payments, and (vi) acquisitions. we expect to rely on cash and cash equivalents as well as on short-term investments, funds provided by our operating activities, and our 2022 credit agreement to satisfy our working capital needs. refer to note 11 - debt for additional discussion of our outstanding debt obligations.
short-term investments as of march 31, 2024, we had $22.0 of short-term investments, which primarily consisted of bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days. from time to time, we may place additional short-term investments depending on future market conditions and liquidity needs.
senior notes on april 14, 2023, we completed our offering and sale of $1,000.0 aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, consisting of $500.0 principal amount of our 5.000% senior notes due 2026 (the "2026 notes") and $500.0 principal amount of our 4.950% senior notes due 2028 ("the 2028 notes"). on january 8, 2024, we completed our add-on offering and sale of $350.0 aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, consisting of $50.0 principal amount of additional 2026 notes and $300.0 principal amount of additional 2028 notes. the additional 2026 notes and additional 2028 notes (the "new notes") were issued as additional notes under the existing indenture (refer to note 11 - debt).
on april 14, 2022, we completed our offering and sale of $2,700.0 aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, consisting of $1,000.0 principal amount of our 3.300% senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 notes"), $600.0 principal amount of our 3.550% senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 notes"), $600.0 principal amount of our 3.700% senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 notes"), and $500.0 principal amount of our 4.000% senior notes due 2032 (the "2032 notes" and together with the 2024 notes, 2025 notes, 2026 notes, 2027 notes, and 2028 notes, the "senior notes").
the senior notes are the company's senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsubordinated obligations. we will pay interest on the 2024 notes, 2026 notes, and 2028 notes semi-annually on march 28 and september 28 of each year, commencing september 28, 2022 for the 2024 notes and september 28, 2023 for the 2026 notes and 2028 notes. we will pay interest on each of the 2025 notes, 2027 notes, and 2032 notes semi-annually on april 14 and october 14 of each year, commencing october 14, 2022. during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024, we made interest payments of $135.2. the proceeds from the issuances of the senior notes were used to finance a portion of our acquisition of zynga and repay certain of our debt. subject to market conditions, we currently intend to refinance the 2025 notes prior to maturity.
on june 5, 2023, pursuant to a tender offer, we purchased and retired $650.0 in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 notes, with proceeds received from the 2026 notes and 2028 notes. we repaid the remaining $350.0 of principal amount of our 2024 notes on its maturity date on march 28, 2024, with proceeds received from the new notes. during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2024, we recognized a debt extinguishment gain of approximately $7.7, net of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs recorded within interest and other, net in our consolidated statement of operations.
credit agreement on may 23, 2022, we entered into an unsecured credit agreement (as amended, the "2022 credit agreement"), which replaced in its entirety the company's prior credit agreement, dated as of february 8, 2019, which was paid off in full and terminated. the 2022 credit agreement provides for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility with commitments of $500.0, including sublimits for (i) the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate face amount of up to $100.0 and (ii) borrowings and letters of credit denominated in pounds sterling, euros, and canadian dollars in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0. in addition, the 2022 credit agreement contains uncommitted incremental capacity permitting the incurrence of up to an additional amount not to exceed the greater of $250.0 and 35.0% of the company's consolidated adjusted ebitda (as defined in the 2022 credit agreement). on may 16, 2024, we increased the total commitments under the facility to $750.0 pursuant to the 2022 credit agreement's incremental provisions, leaving no further uncommitted incremental capacity.
loans under the 2022 credit agreement will bear interest at a rate of (a) 0.000% to 0.625% above an alternate base rate (8.50% at march 31, 2024) or (b) 1.000% to 1.625% above secured overnight financing rate ("sofr"), approximately 5.33% at march 31, 2024, which rates are determined by the company's credit rating.
as of march 31, 2024, there were no borrowings under the 2022 credit agreement, and we had approximately $497.7 available for additional borrowings.
convertible notes in conjunction with the acquisition of zynga on may 23, 2022 (refer to note 20 - acquisitions), we entered into (a) the first supplemental indenture (the "2024 supplemental indenture") to the indenture, dated as of june 14, 2019 (the "2024 indenture"), between zynga and computershare trust company, n.a. (as successor to wells fargo bank, national association) (the "convertible notes trustee"), relating to zynga's 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 convertible notes"), and (b) the first supplemental indenture (the "2026 supplemental indenture" and, together with the 2024 supplemental indenture, the "supplemental indentures") to the indenture, dated as of december 17, 2020 (the "2026 indenture" and, together with the 2024 indenture, the "indentures"), between zynga and the convertible notes trustee, relating to zynga's 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the "2026 convertible notes" and, together with the 2024 convertible notes, the "convertible notes"). as of the closing date of the acquisition, approximately $690.0 aggregate principal amount of the 2024 convertible notes was outstanding and approximately $874.5 aggregate principal amount of the 2026 convertible notes was outstanding.
following the acquisition and according to the supplemental indentures, we assumed all of zynga's rights and obligations under the indentures, and the company guaranteed the payment and other obligations of zynga under the convertible notes. as a result of our acquisition of zynga, the right to convert each one thousand dollar principal amount of such convertible notes into shares of zynga common stock was changed into a right to convert such principal amount of such convertible notes into the number of units of reference property equal to the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the closing of the zynga acquisition, in each case pursuant to the terms and procedures set forth in the applicable indenture. a unit of reference property is defined in each indenture as 0.0406 shares of take-two common stock and $3.50 in cash, without interest, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of take-two common stock.
the 2024 convertible notes and 2026 convertible notes mature on june 1, 2024, and december 15, 2026, respectively, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased in accordance with their terms, respectively, prior to the maturity date. interest is payable semiannually on the 2024 convertible notes in arrears on march 1 and september 1 of each year. the 2026 convertible notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount does not accrete.
the acquisition of zynga constituted a fundamental change, a make-whole fundamental change, and a share exchange event (each as defined in the indentures) under the indentures. the effective date of the fundamental change, make-whole fundamental change and share exchange event in respect of the convertible notes was may 23, 2022, and the related tender and conversion periods expired on june 22, 2022. as a result, each holder of convertible notes had the right to tender its convertible notes to the company for cash or surrender its convertible notes for conversion into the reference property at the applicable conversion rate, in each case pursuant to the terms and procedures set forth in the applicable indenture.
as of the expiration of the fundamental change, make-whole fundamental change, and share exchange event, (a) $0.3 aggregate principal amount of the 2024 convertible notes and (b) $845.1 aggregate principal amount of the 2026 convertible notes were tendered for cash. in addition, (a) $668.3 aggregate principal amount of the 2024 convertible notes, and (b) no 2026 convertible notes were surrendered for conversion into the applicable reference property. in total, we paid $321.6 for the tendered or converted 2024 convertible notes, including interest, and $845.1 for the tendered 2026 convertible notes in cash, and we issued 3.7 shares of our common stock upon the conversion of the 2024 convertible notes. after settlement of all convertible notes tendered or surrendered for conversion, $21.4 aggregate principal amount of the 2024 convertible notes remained outstanding and $29.4 aggregate principal amount of the 2026 convertible notes remained outstanding at march 31, 2024.
financial condition we are subject to credit risks, particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets. if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due, it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position.
generally, we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business. we do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers. we have trade credit insurance on the majority of our customers to mitigate accounts receivable risk.
a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major retailers, including digital storefronts and platform partners, and distributors. our five largest customers accounted for 79.8%, 79.6% and 79.0% of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. as of march 31, 2024, and 2023, five customers comprised 69.9% and 61.1% of our gross accounts receivable, respectively, with our significant customers (those that individually comprised more than 10% of our gross accounts receivable balance) accounting for 57.7% and 50.3% of such balance at march 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. we had three customers who accounted for 21.8%, 18.1%, and 16.9% of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31, 2024, and three customers who accounted for 21.6%, 14.5%, and 14.2% of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31, 2023. we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10% of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31, 2024, and 2023. based upon performing ongoing credit evaluations, maintaining trade credit insurance on a majority of our customers who sell our physical products and our past collection experience, we believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk, although we actively monitor each customer's creditworthiness and economic conditions that may affect our customers' business and access to capital. we are monitoring the current global economic conditions, including credit markets and other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable.
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and projected cash flow from operations, along with availability under our 2022 credit agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, and commitments on both a short-term and long-term basis.
as of march 31, 2024, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the u.s. by our foreign subsidiaries was $629.6. these balances are dispersed across various locations around the world. we believe that such dispersion meets the business and liquidity needs of our foreign affiliates. in addition, we expect to have the ability to generate sufficient cash domestically to support ongoing operations for the foreseeable future.
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 21.7 shares of our common stock. under this program, we may purchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods, including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws. repurchases are subject to the availability of stock, prevailing market conditions, the trading price of the stock, our financial performance and other conditions. the program does not require us to repurchase shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason.
during the fiscal years ended march 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we repurchased 0.0, 0.0, and 1.3 shares of our common stock, respectively, in the open market for $0.0, $0.0, and $200.0, respectively, including commissions as part of the program. as of march 31, 2024, we had repurchased a total of 11.7 shares of our common stock under the program, and 10.0 shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under the share repurchase program.
our changes in cash flows were as follows:

at march 31, 2024, we had $1,102.0 of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents, compared to $1,234.6 at march 31, 2023. the decrease was primarily due to net cash used in financing activities, primarily related to net share settlements of our restricted stock awards and payment of contingent earn-outs for prior acquisitions, partially offset by issuance of common stock and our net debt activity. the debt activity included proceeds from the issuance of 2026 notes and 2028 notes offset by our repayment of 2024 notes and term loan (refer to note 11 - debt). to a lesser extent, the decrease was also due to i) net cash used in investing activities which was due primarily to the purchase of fixed assets and our immaterial acquisitions and investments, offset by our sales and maturities of available for sale securities, and ii) net cash used in operating activities, which was due primarily to investments in software development and licenses, partially offset by sales of our products.
commitments refer to note 14 - commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our commitments.
capital expenditures in fiscal year 2025, we anticipate capital expenditures to be $140.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of march 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. as such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
international operations net revenue earned outside of the united states is principally generated by our operations in europe, asia, australia, canada and latin america. for the fiscal years ended march 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, 38.7%, 37.2%, and 40.1%, respectively, of our net revenue was earned outside the united states. we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased credit risks, tariffs and duties, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays and international political, regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results.
fluctuations in quarterly operating results and seasonality we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles, variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms, market acceptance of our titles, development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles, sequels or enhancements of existing titles, projected and actual changes in platforms, the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors, product returns, changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors, the accuracy of retailers' forecasts of consumer demand, the size and timing of acquisitions, the timing of orders from major customers, and order cancellations and delays in product shipment. sales of our full game products are also seasonal, with peak demand typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter during the holiday season. for certain of our software products with multiple performance obligations, we defer the recognition of our net revenue over an estimated service period which generally ranges from six to fifteen months. as a result, the quarter in which we generate the highest net bookings may be different from the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue. quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.

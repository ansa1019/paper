strategic objectives over the past two years, the company has re-shaped its portfolio to focus on its leading positions in the tools & outdoor and engineered fastening markets. leveraging the benefits of a more focused portfolio, the company initiated a business transformation in mid-2022 that includes reinvestment for faster growth as well as a $2.0 billion global cost reduction program through 2025. the company's primary areas of multi-year strategic focus remain unchanged as follows:
•advancing innovation, electrification and global market penetration to achieve organic revenue growth of 2 to 3 times the market;
•streamlining and simplifying the organization, and investing in initiatives that more directly impact the company's customers and end users;
•returning adjusted gross margins to historical 35%+ levels by accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to improve fill rates and better match inventory with customer demand; and
•prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization.
the company's business transformation is intended to drive strong financial performance over the long term, including:
•organic revenue growth at 2 to 3 times the market;
•35%+ adjusted gross margins;
•free cash flow equal to, or exceeding, net income; and
•cash flow return on investment ("cfroi"), computed as cash from operations plus after-tax interest expense, divided by the two-point average of debt and equity, between 12-15%.
in terms of capital allocation, the company remains committed, over time, to returning excess capital to shareholders through a strong and growing dividend as well as opportunistically repurchasing shares. in the near term, the company intends to direct any capital in excess of the quarterly dividend on its common stock toward debt reduction and internal growth investments. share repurchases and other securities during the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased 12,645,371 shares of its common stock for approximately $2.3 billion through a combination of an accelerated share repurchase ("asr"), which provided for an initial delivery of 85% of the total notional share equivalent at execution, or 10,756,770 shares, and open market share repurchases for a total of 1,888,601 shares. the final delivery of the remaining shares under the asr totaled 3,211,317 and was completed during the second quarter of 2022.
refer to note j, capital stock, for further discussion.
in addition, on april 23, 2021, the board of directors approved repurchases by the company of its outstanding securities, other than its common stock up to an aggregate amount of $3.0 billion. no repurchases have been executed pursuant to this authorization to date.
pending sale of infrastructure business in december 2023, the company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of its infrastructure business to epiroc ab for $760 million in cash. the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. the company expects to utilize the net proceeds to reduce debt.
divestitures on august 19, 2022, the company sold its oil & gas business comprised of the pipeline services and equipment businesses to pipeline technique limited.
on july 22, 2022, the company sold its convergent security solutions ("css") business comprised of the commercial electronic security and healthcare businesses to securitas ab for net proceeds of approximately $3.1 billion.
on july 5, 2022, the company sold its mechanical access solutions ("mas") business comprised of the automatic doors business to allegion plc for net proceeds of $916.0 million.
proceeds from the sale of these businesses were used to repay borrowings made in the first quarter of 2022 to fund the company's share repurchase program previously discussed. the use of proceeds to support a share repurchase program is consistent with the company's long-term capital allocation strategy.
the company has also divested several smaller businesses in recent years that allowed the company to invest in other areas that fit into its long-term strategy.
refer to note t, divestitures, for further discussion of the company's divestitures.
acquisitions on december 1, 2021, the company acquired the remaining 80 percent ownership stake in mtd holdings inc. ("mtd"), a privately held global designer, manufacturer and distributor of lawn tractors, zero turn ride on mowers, walk behind mowers, snow blowers, residential robotic mowers, hand-held outdoor power equipment and garden tools for both residential and professional consumers under well-known brands like cub cadet® and troy-bilt®. the company previously acquired a 20 percent interest in mtd in january 2019.
on november 12, 2021, the company acquired excel industries ("excel"), a leading designer and manufacturer of premium commercial and residential turf-care equipment under the hustler® brand. this was a strategically important bolt-on acquisition that bolstered the company's presence in the independent dealer network.
the combination of mtd, excel and the company's existing outdoor strategic business unit in tools & outdoor created a global leader in the $25 billion outdoor category, with strong brands and growth opportunities. as part of the integration of these businesses into the tools & outdoor segment, the company designed, developed and manufactured battery and electric-powered solutions for professional and residential users. this positioned the combined businesses to be a leader in outdoor power equipment as preferences shift from gas powered equipment toward electrified solutions.
refer to note e, acquisitions, for further discussion.
global cost reduction program in mid-2022, the company launched a program comprised of a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings by resizing the organization and reducing inventory with the ultimate objective of driving long-term growth, improving profitability and generating strong cash flow. these initiatives are expected to optimize the cost base as well as provide a platform to fund investments to accelerate growth in the core businesses. the program consists of a selling, general, and administrative ("sg&a") planned pre-tax run-rate cost savings of $500 million and a supply chain transformation expected to deliver $1.5 billion of pre-tax run-rate cost savings by the end of 2025 to achieve projected 35%+ adjusted gross margins.
the sg&a cost savings are expected to be generated by simplifying the corporate structure, optimizing organizational spans and layers and reducing indirect spend. these savings will help fund $300 million to $500 million of innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. the charges associated with the sg&a savings were reflected in non-gaap adjustments in 2022 detailed below in "results from operations".
the $1.5 billion of pre-tax run-rate cost savings from the supply chain transformation will be driven by the following value streams:
•strategic sourcing: implementing capabilities to source in a more efficient and integrated manner across all of the company's businesses and leveraging contract manufacturing;
•operational excellence: leveraging the sbd operating model and re-designing in-plant operations following footprint rationalization to deliver incremental efficiencies, simplified organizational design and inventory optimization;
•footprint rationalization: transforming the company's manufacturing and distribution network from a decentralized and inefficient system of sites built through years of acquisitions to a strategically focused supply chain, inclusive of site closures, transformations of existing sites into manufacturing centers of excellence and re-configuration of the distribution network; and
•complexity reduction: reducing complexity through platforming products and implementing initiatives to drive a sku reduction.
the charges associated with the supply chain transformation are reflected in the non-gaap adjustments detailed below in "results from operations" and the full year estimate of non-gaap adjustments detailed below in "2024 outlook". the cash investment required to achieve the $1.5 billion of pre-tax run-rate supply chain cost savings is expected to be approximately $0.9 billion to $1.1 billion, of which approximately 40% is expected to be capital expenditures. through 2023, the company has made approximately $0.2 billion of these cash investments. the company will continue prioritizing capital expenditures consistent with its existing approach and expects total capital expenditures, inclusive of the supply chain transformation, to be $400 million to $500 million for 2024 and to approximate 3.0% to 3.5% of net sales annually in 2025 and beyond.
during 2023 and since inception of the program, the company has generated approximately $835 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of pre-tax run-rate savings, driven by lower headcount, indirect spend reductions and the supply chain transformation. these savings are comprised of supply chain efficiency benefits, which will support gross margin improvements as the benefits turn through inventory, and sg&a savings. the company believes that it is on track to grow to approximately $2 billion of pre-tax run-rate savings by year-end 2025. in addition, the company has reduced inventory by approximately $1.9 billion since the end of the second quarter of 2022 and expects further inventory and working capital reductions to support free cash flow generation in 2024.
driving further profitable growth by fully leveraging the company's core franchises each of the company's core franchises share common attributes: they have iconic brands and attractive growth characteristics, they are scalable and defensible and they can differentiate through innovation.
•the tools & outdoor business carries strong brands, proven innovation, global scale, and a broad offering of power tools, hand tools, outdoor products, accessories, and storage and digital products across many channels in both developed and developing markets.
•the engineered fastening business within the industrial segment is a highly profitable, gdp+ growth business offering highly engineered, value-added innovative solutions with recurring revenue attributes and global scale.
management recognizes that the core franchises described above are important foundations that have a proven track record of providing strong cash flow and growth prospects. management is committed to growing these businesses through accelerating investments into innovative product development, brand support, commercial activation, and accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to improve fill rates and better match inventory with customer demand, while improving global cost competitiveness.

craftsman® returned as the title sponsor of the nascar craftsman® truck series through the company's sponsorship with nascar as the "official tools partner of nascar" and "official tools" of all nascar-owned tracks.
the company has also maintained long-standing nascar and nhra team sponsorships, which provided brand exposure during nearly 60 events in 2023 with the dewalt®, craftsman®, and mac tools® brands.
in 2023, the mclaren team sported the dewalt® logo prominently on the team's cars, fire suits, and equipment during the formula 1 season. the company also advertises in the english premier league, which is the number one soccer league in the world, featuring the dewalt® brand to a global audience. the company continued its sponsorship of one of the world's most popular football clubs, fc barcelona, sponsoring both the men's and women's first teams, which includes team and player image rights, hospitality assets and stadium signage.
the above marketing initiatives highlight the company's strong emphasis on brand building and commercial support, which has resulted in more than 300 billion global brand impressions from digital and traditional advertising and strong brand awareness. allocating brand and advertising spend judiciously will continue to be the company's focus. among the goals: placing end-user data and insights at the core of product commercialization, generating demand and brand loyalty through promotional support, in-market execution and salesforce effectiveness, evolving proven marketing programs that tie trusted global brands with societal purpose and tapping into technologies to build meaningful 1:1 experiences with customers, consumers, employees and shareholders in line with the company's mission and vision.
segments the company's operations are classified into two reportable business segments: tools & outdoor and industrial.
the tools & outdoor segment is comprised of the power tools group ("ptg"), hand tools, accessories & storage ("htas"), and outdoor power equipment ("outdoor") product lines.
the ptg product line includes both professional and consumer products. professional products, primarily under the dewalt® brand, include professional grade corded and cordless electric power tools and equipment including drills, impact wrenches and drivers, grinders, saws, routers and sanders, as well as pneumatic tools and fasteners including nail guns, nails, staplers and staples, and concrete and masonry anchors. diy and tradesperson focused products include corded and cordless electric power tools sold primarily under the craftsman® brand, and consumer home products such as hand-held vacuums, paint tools and cleaning appliances primarily under the black+decker® brand.
the htas product line sells hand tools, power tool accessories and storage products. hand tools include measuring, leveling and layout tools, planes, hammers, demolition tools, clamps, vises, knives, saws, chisels and industrial and automotive tools. power tool accessories include drill bits, screwdriver bits, router bits, abrasives, saw blades and threading products. storage products include tool boxes, sawhorses, medical cabinets and engineered storage solution products.
the outdoor product line primarily sells corded and cordless electric lawn and garden products, including hedge trimmers, string trimmers, lawn mowers, pressure washers and related accessories, and gas powered lawn and garden products, including lawn tractors, zero turn ride on mowers, walk behind mowers, snow blowers, residential robotic mowers, utility terrain vehicles (utvs), hand-held outdoor power equipment, garden tools, and parts and accessories to professionals and consumers under the dewalt®, craftsman®, cub cadet®, black+decker®, and hustler® brand names.
industrial the industrial segment is comprised of the engineered fastening and infrastructure businesses.
the engineered fastening business primarily sells highly engineered components such as fasteners, fittings and various engineered products, which are designed for specific application across multiple verticals. the product lines include externally threaded fasteners, blind rivets and tools, blind inserts and tools, drawn arc weld studs and systems, engineered plastic and mechanical fasteners, self-piercing riveting systems, precision nut running systems, micro fasteners, high-strength structural fasteners, axel swage, latches, heat shields, pins, and couplings.
the infrastructure business designs, manufactures, and sells attachments, typically used on excavators, and handheld hydraulic and battery-powered tools for applications in infrastructure, construction, scrap recycling, demolition, and railroad infrastructure.
results of operations the company's results represent continuing operations and as a result of the 2022 divestitures of the company's css and mas businesses, as described in further detail under the heading "divestitures" in this item 7 above, exclude the commercial electronic security, healthcare, and automatic doors businesses. these divestitures represented a single plan to exit the security segment and were considered a strategic shift that had a major effect on the company's operations and financial results. therefore, the operating results of these businesses were classified as discontinued operations through their respective dates of sale. the divestiture of the oil & gas business did not qualify for discontinued operations and therefore, its results were included in the company's continuing operations within the industrial segment through the date of sale in the third quarter of
2022. the pending divestiture of the infrastructure business did not qualify for discontinued operations and therefore, its results are included in the company's continuing operations within the industrial segment for all periods presented.
certain items impacting earnings and non-gaap financial measures the company has provided a discussion of its results both inclusive and exclusive of certain gains and charges. the results and measures, including gross profit, sg&a, other, net, income taxes, and segment profit (including corporate overhead), on a basis excluding certain gains and charges, free cash flow, organic revenue and organic growth are non-gaap financial measures. the company considers the use of non-gaap financial measures relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the company's results and business trends aside from the material impact of these items and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods. supplemental non-gaap information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap financial measures. non-gaap financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.
with the exception of forecasted free cash flow included in "2024 outlook" as discussed below, the non-gaap financial measures of gross profit, sg&a, other, net, income taxes, and segment profit (including corporate overhead), presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges, as well as free cash flow, organic revenue and organic growth are defined and reconciled to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures below. due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations, a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable gaap estimate has been omitted. the company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.
the company's operating results at the consolidated level as discussed below include and exclude certain gains and charges impacting gross profit, sg&a, other, net, and income taxes. the company's business segment results as discussed below include and exclude certain gains and charges impacting gross profit and sg&a. these amounts for 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:

below is a summary of the company's operating results at the consolidated level, followed by an overview of business segment performance. organic growth is utilized to describe the company's results excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions during their initial 12 months of ownership, and divestitures.
consolidated results net sales: net sales were $15.781 billion in 2023 compared to $16.947 billion in 2022, representing a decrease of 7%, as a 1% increase in price was more than offset by a 7% decrease in volume and a 1% decrease from the oil & gas divestiture. tools & outdoor net sales decreased 7% compared to 2022 due to a 7% decline in volume. industrial net sales decreased 4% compared to 2022 as a 3% increase in price was more than offset by a 4% decrease from the oil & gas divestiture and a 3% decrease in volume.
net sales were $16.947 billion in 2022 compared to $15.281 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 11% driven by a 7% increase in price and a 17% increase from acquisitions, partially offset by a 10% decrease in volume and a 3% decrease from foreign currency. tools & storage net sales increased 13% compared to 2021 due to a 7% increase in price and a 21% increase from acquisitions, partially offset by a 12% decrease in volume and a 3% decrease from foreign currency. industrial net sales increased 2% compared to 2021 primarily due to a 1% increase in volume and an 8% increase in price, partially offset by a 5% decrease from foreign currency and a 2% decrease from the oil & gas divestiture.
gross profit: the company reported gross profit of $3.933 billion, or 24.9% of net sales, in 2023 compared to $4.284 billion, or 25.3% of net sales, in 2022. non-gaap adjustments, which reduced gross profit, were $166.9 million in 2023 and $127.4 million in 2022. despite lower volume, the impact of selling through high-cost inventory, and production curtailments, gross profit, excluding non-gaap adjustments, was 26.0% of net sales in both 2023 and 2022, due to price realization, supply chain transformation benefits, lower inventory destocking costs, and lower shipping costs.
the company reported gross profit of $4.284 billion, or 25.3% of net sales, in 2022 compared to $5.092 billion, or 33.3% of net sales, in 2021. non-gaap adjustments, which reduced gross profit, were $127.4 million in 2022 and $39.0 million in 2021. excluding these adjustments, gross profit was 26.0% of net sales in 2022 compared to 33.6% in 2021, as price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation, higher supply chain costs, including the impact of planned production curtailments, and lower volume.
sg&a expenses: selling, general and administrative expenses, inclusive of the provision for credit losses, were $3.291 billion, or 20.9% of net sales, in 2023 compared to $3.370 billion, or 19.9% of net sales, in 2022. sg&a declined year-over-year on an absolute dollar basis reflecting cost reductions. within sg&a, non-gaap adjustments totaled $99.4 million in 2023 and $180.3 million in 2022. excluding these adjustments, sg&a was 20.2% of net sales in 2023 compared to 18.8% in 2022, reflecting the impact of lower sales volume, but relatively flat year-over-year on an absolute dollar basis as the benefits from the global cost reduction program were offset by increased investments in growth initiatives, higher variable compensation expense and inflation.
sg&a expenses were $3.370 billion, or 19.9% of net sales, in 2022 compared to $3.193 billion, or 20.9% of net sales, in 2021. within sg&a, non-gaap adjustments totaled $180.3 million in 2022 and $183.6 million in 2021. excluding these adjustments, sg&a was 18.8% of net sales in 2022 compared to 19.7% in 2021 due to the successful implementation of cost control actions.
distribution center costs (i.e. warehousing and fulfillment facility and associated labor costs) are classified within sg&a. this classification may differ from other companies who may report such expenses within cost of sales. due to diversity in practice, to the extent the classification of these distribution costs differs from other companies, the company's gross margins may not be comparable. such distribution costs classified in sg&a amounted to $521.7 million, $498.7 million and $416.1 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. the increase in distribution costs in 2023 compared to 2022 reflects costs associated with footprint rationalization actions under the supply chain transformation as well as the company's focus on inventory reduction.
other, net: other, net totaled $320.1 million, $274.8 million, and $189.5 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. excluding non-gaap adjustments, other, net, totaled $345.2 million, $257.9 million, and $165.3 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. the increase in 2023 is driven by higher pension and environmental remediation costs as well as write-downs on certain investments. the year-over-year increase in 2022 was primarily due to higher intangible asset amortization due to the mtd and excel acquisitions and appreciation of investments in 2021.
loss on sales of businesses: during 2023, the company reported a loss of $10.8 million primarily related to the divestiture of a small business in the industrial segment. during 2022, the company reported a net loss of $8.4 million primarily related to the divestiture of the oil & gas business. during 2021, the company reported a $0.6 million net loss on divestitures.
gain on equity method investment: upon the acquisition of mtd in the fourth quarter of 2021, the company recognized a $68.0 million gain on its previously held equity method investment. refer to note e, acquisitions, for further discussion.
asset impairment charges: during 2023, the company recorded impairment charges of $274.8 million, comprised of a $124.0 million impairment charge related to the irwin and troy-bilt trade names and a $150.8 million impairment charge related to the infrastructure business. during 2022, the company recorded an impairment charge of $168.4 million related to the oil & gas business. refer to note f, goodwill and intangible assets, for additional information on the trade name impairments. refer to note t, divestitures, for additional information on the pending divestiture of the infrastructure business and the 2022 divestiture of the oil & gas business.
interest, net: net interest expense in 2023 was $372.5 million compared to $283.8 million in 2022 and $175.6 million in 2021. the 2023 increase was primarily driven by higher u.s. interest rates and debt issuances in march 2023, partially offset by higher interest income due to an increase in rates. the increase in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by higher u.s. interest rates and higher average balances relating to the company's commercial paper borrowings, as well as the $1.0 billion issuance of debt in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by higher interest income due to an increase in rates.
income taxes: the company's effective tax rate on continuing operations was 25.0% in 2023, (349.3)% in 2022, and 3.5% in 2021. excluding the tax effect on non-gaap adjustments, the effective tax rate in 2023 on continuing operations was (14.8)%. this effective tax rate differs from the u.s. statutory tax rate primarily due to a tax benefit associated with an intra-entity asset transfer of certain intangible assets related to the continued reorganization of the supply chain, tax on foreign earnings at tax rates different than the u.s. tax rate, state income taxes, and tax credits, partially offset by u.s. tax on foreign earnings, non-deductible expenses, withholding taxes, and losses for which a tax benefit is not recognized.
excluding the tax effect on non-gaap adjustments, the effective tax rate on continuing operations in 2022 was (7.1)%. this effective tax rate differs from the u.s. statutory tax rate primarily due to a tax benefit associated with an intra-entity asset transfer of certain intangible assets related to the continued reorganization of the supply chain, tax on foreign earnings at tax rates different than the u.s. tax rate, and the recognition of previously unrecognized foreign deferred tax assets, offset by u.s. tax on foreign earnings and the remeasurement of uncertain tax position reserves.
excluding the tax effect on non-gaap adjustments, the effective tax rate on continuing operations in 2021 was 6.7%. this effective tax rate differs from the u.s. statutory tax rate primarily due to a tax benefit associated with an intra-entity asset transfer of certain intangible assets related to the company's supply chain reorganization, tax on foreign earnings, the remeasurement of uncertain tax position reserves, the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to foreign corporate income tax rate changes, and the tax benefit of equity-based compensation.
on december 20, 2021, the organization for economic cooperation and development ("oecd") published a proposal for the establishment of a global minimum tax rate of 15% ("pillar two"). the pillar two rules provide a template that jurisdictions can translate into domestic law, to assist with the implementation within an agreed upon timeframe and in a coordinated manner, and are effective for fiscal years beginning after january 1, 2024. to date, jurisdictions in which the company operates are in various stages of implementation.
the company has performed an initial assessment of the potential impact to income taxes as a result of pillar two. the assessment of the potential impact is based on the most recent tax filings, country-by-country reporting, and financial statements of affected subsidiaries. based on results of the assessment, the company believes it can avail itself of the transitional safe harbor rules in most jurisdictions in which the company operates. there are, however, a limited number of jurisdictions where the transitional safe harbor relief does not apply. the company does not currently expect a material impact to income taxes in those jurisdictions in the near term. the company continues to assess the potential impact of pillar two and monitor developments in legislation, regulation, and interpretive guidance in this area.
business segment results the company's reportable segments represent businesses that have similar products, services and end markets, among other factors. the company utilizes segment profit which is defined as net sales minus cost of sales and sg&a inclusive of the provision for credit losses (aside from corporate overhead expense), and segment profit as a percentage of net sales to assess the profitability of each segment.
the company's operations are classified into two reportable business segments: tools & outdoor and industrial.
tools & outdoor:

% of net sales                      5.1   %                  6.7   %                 15.5   %
tools & outdoor net sales decreased $1.057 billion, or 7%, in 2023 compared to 2022 due to a 7% decline in volume. organic revenue decreased 8%, 4% and 3% in north america, europe and emerging markets, respectively. the overall 7% organic decline was a result of lower consumer outdoor and diy market demand. the 2023 u.s. retail point-of-sale demand remained above pre-pandemic 2019 levels, supported by price increases and strength in professional tools.
segment profit amounted to $687.6 million, or 5.1% of net sales, in 2023 compared to $971.9 million, or 6.7% of net sales, in 2022. excluding non-gaap adjustments of $196.7 million and $235.4 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, segment profit amounted to 6.6% of net sales in 2023 compared to 8.4% in 2022, as supply chain transformation savings and reduced shipping costs were more than offset by selling through high-cost inventory, production curtailments and lower volume.
tools & outdoor net sales increased $1.606 billion, or 13%, in 2022 compared to 2021 due to a 7% increase in price and a 21% increase from acquisitions, partially offset by a 12% decrease in volume and a 3% decrease from foreign currency. the overall 5% organic decline was a result of lower consumer and diy market demand. organic revenue in emerging markets increased 1% and declined in both europe and north america by 6%.
segment profit amounted to $971.9 million, or 6.7% of net sales, in 2022 compared to $1.985 billion, or 15.5% of net sales, in 2021. excluding non-gaap adjustments of $235.4 million and $178.4 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, segment profit amounted to 8.4% of net sales in 2022 compared to 16.9% in 2021, as the benefit from price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation, higher supply chain costs, production curtailment costs and lower volume.
industrial:

industrial net sales decreased $109.4 million, or 4%, in 2023 compared to 2022, as a 3% increase in price was more than offset by a 4% decrease from the oil & gas divestiture and a 3% decrease in volume. engineered fastening organic revenues were up 6%, with double-digit growth in both aerospace and automotive, which was partially offset by softness in general industrial fastener markets.
segment profit totaled $266.5 million, or 11.0% of net sales, in 2023 compared to $236.2 million, or 9.4% of net sales, in 2022. excluding non-gaap adjustments of $18.7 million and $7.8 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, segment profit amounted to 11.8% of net sales in 2023 compared to 9.7% in 2022, as price realization and cost control more than offset lower volume.
industrial net sales increased $60.3 million, or 2%, in 2022 compared to 2021, due to a 1% increase in volume and an 8% increase in price, partially offset by a 5% decrease from foreign currency and a 2% decrease from the oil & gas divestiture. engineered fastening organic revenues increased 7% driven by growth in the aerospace, automotive, and industrial markets. infrastructure organic revenues were up 14% with attachment tools providing 17% growth, which was partially offset by an organic decline in oil & gas, prior to its divestiture.
segment profit totaled $236.2 million, or 9.4% of net sales, in 2022 compared to $256.6 million, or 10.4% of net sales, in 2021. excluding non-gaap adjustments of $7.8 million and $13.1 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, segment profit amounted to 9.7% of net sales in 2022 compared to 10.9% in 2021, as higher volumes and price realization were more than offset by commodity inflation, higher supply chain costs and adverse mix.
corporate overhead corporate overhead includes the corporate overhead element of sg&a, which is not allocated to the business segments. corporate overhead amounted to $312.2 million, $294.0 million, and $342.9 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. excluding non-gaap adjustments of $50.9 million, $64.5 million, and $31.1 million, in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, the corporate overhead element of sg&a was $261.3 million, $229.5 million, and $311.8 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. the year-over-year increase in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by higher employee-related variable compensation costs. the year-over-year decrease in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to lower employee-related costs.

during 2023, the company recognized net restructuring charges of $39 million, primarily related to severance and facility closures associated with the footprint rationalization actions under the supply chain transformation. the company expects to achieve annual net cost savings of approximately $45 million by the end of 2024 related to the restructuring costs incurred during 2023. the majority of the $29 million of reserves remaining as of december 30, 2023 is expected to be utilized within the next twelve months.
during 2022, the company recognized net restructuring charges of $141 million, primarily related to severance and related costs, including sg&a cost actions under the global cost reduction program. the company estimates that these actions resulted in net cost savings of approximately $300 million in 2023.
during 2021, the company recognized net restructuring charges of $15 million, primarily related to facility closures and asset impairments. the company estimates that these actions resulted in net cost savings of approximately $24 million in 2022.
segments: the $39 million of net restructuring charges in 2023 includes: $31 million pertaining to the tools & outdoor segment; $1 million pertaining to the industrial segment; and $7 million pertaining to corporate.
the anticipated annual net cost savings of approximately $45 million related to the 2023 restructuring actions include: $40 million in the tools & outdoor segment; $2 million in the industrial segment; and $3 million in corporate.
2024 outlook this outlook discussion is intended to provide broad insight into the company's near-term earnings and cash flow generation prospects. the company expects 2024 diluted earnings per share to approximate $1.60 to $2.85 on a gaap basis ($3.50 to $4.50 excluding non-gaap adjustments). free cash flow is expected to approximate $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion, significantly ahead of net income, as the company continues to prioritize inventory reductions. this outlook assumes the previously announced infrastructure divestiture closes at the end of the first quarter 2024.
the difference between 2024 diluted earnings per share outlook and the diluted earnings per share range, excluding non-gaap adjustments, is approximately $1.65 to $1.90, consisting primarily of charges related to the supply chain transformation under the global cost reduction program.
financial condition liquidity, sources and uses of capital: the company's primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and available lines of credit under various credit facilities.
operating activities: cash flows provided by operations were $1.191 billion in 2023 compared to cash used in operations of $1.460 billion in 2022. the year-over-year change was primarily driven by the company's focus on reducing inventory, as evidenced by a decline of $1.123 billion in inventory in 2023.
in 2022, cash flows used in operations were $1.460 billion compared to cash provided by operations of $663.1 million in 2021. the year-over-year change was mainly attributable to lower accounts payable balances, lower earnings from continuing operations, and higher inventory balances. during the second half of 2020 and during 2021, the company experienced higher than historical customer demand and increased supply chain constraints, resulting in historically high inventory levels in the first half of 2022 as consumer and diy demand softened.
free cash flow: free cash flow, as defined in the table below, was an inflow of $853 million in 2023 compared to an outflow of $1.990 billion in 2022 and an inflow of $144 million in 2021. the year-over-year changes in free cash flow are due to the same factors discussed above in operating activities, as well as lower planned capital expenditures in 2023. management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity and capital efficiency, as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide dividends to shareowners, and is useful information for investors. free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the company's common and preferred stock and business acquisitions, among other items.

investing activities: cash flows used in investing activities totaled $328 million in 2023 primarily due to capital and software expenditures of $338 million.
cash flows provided by investing activities in 2022 totaled $3.573 billion, primarily due to proceeds from the security and oil & gas divestitures, net of cash sold, of $4.147 billion, partially offset by capital and software expenditures of $530 million.
cash flows used in investing activities in 2021 totaled $2.624 billion, driven by business acquisitions of $2.044 billion, net of cash acquired, primarily related to the mtd and excel acquisitions, and capital and software expenditures of $519 million.
financing activities: cash flows used in financing activities totaled $816 million in 2023 primarily driven by net repayments of short-term commercial paper borrowings of $1.045 billion and cash dividend payments on common stock of $483 million, partially offset by net proceeds from debt issuances of $745 million.
cash flows used in financing activities totaled $1.971 billion in 2022 primarily driven by share repurchases of $2.323 billion, credit facility repayments of $2.5 billion, the redemption and conversion of preferred stock for $750 million, cash dividend payments on common stock of $466 million, and net repayments of short-term commercial paper borrowings of $138 million, partially offset by $2.5 billion from credit facility borrowings, net proceeds from debt issuances of $993 million and proceeds from the issuance of remarketed series d preferred stock of $750 million.
cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $919 million in 2021 primarily driven by net short-term commercial paper borrowings of $2.225 billion and proceeds from issuances of common stock of $131 million, partially offset by the redemption and conversion of preferred stock for $750 million, cash dividend payments on common stock of $475 million, and $75 million related to the termination of interest rate swaps.
fluctuations in foreign currency rates positively impacted cash by $2 million in 2023. fluctuations in foreign currency rates negatively impacted cash by $32 million and $62 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other currencies.

credit ratings and liquidity:
the company maintains investment grade credit ratings from the major u.s. rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt (s&p a-, fitch bbb+, moody's baa3), as well as its commercial paper program (s&p a-2, fitch f2, moody's p-3). in the first quarter of 2023, fitch downgraded the company's senior unsecured debt credit rating to bbb+, from its previous rating of a-, and its commercial paper program to f2, from its previous rating of f1. in the third quarter of 2023, s&p downgraded the company's senior unsecured debt credit rating to a-, from its previous rating of a, and its commercial paper program to a-2, from its previous rating of a-1. in the fourth quarter of 2023, moody's downgraded the company's senior unsecured debt credit rating to baa3, from its previous rating of baa2, and its commercial paper program to p-3, from its previous rating of p-2. failure to maintain investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the company's cost of funds, liquidity, and access to capital markets, but would not have an adverse effect on the company's ability to access its existing committed credit facilities.
cash and cash equivalents totaled $449 million as of december 30, 2023 of which approximately 50% was held in foreign jurisdictions. cash and cash equivalents totaled $396 million as of december 31, 2022, which was primarily held in foreign jurisdictions.
as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act (the "act"), the company's tax liability related to the one-time transition tax associated with unremitted foreign earnings and profits totaled $171 million at december 30, 2023. the act permits a u.s. company to elect to pay the net tax liability interest-free over a period of up to eight years. see the "contractual obligations" table below for the estimated amounts due by period. the company has considered the implications of paying the required one-time transition tax and believes it will not have a material impact on its liquidity.
the company has a $3.5 billion commercial paper program which includes euro denominated borrowings in addition to u.s. dollars. as of december 30, 2023, the company had commercial paper borrowings outstanding of $1.1 billion, of which $399.7 million in euro denominated commercial paper was designated as a net investment hedge. refer to note i, financial instruments, for further discussion. as of december 31, 2022, the company had commercial paper borrowings outstanding of $2.1 billion, which did not include any euro denominated commercial paper.
the company has a five-year $2.5 billion committed credit facility (the "5-year credit agreement"). borrowings under the 5-year credit agreement may be made in u.s. dollars, euros or pounds sterling. a sub-limit amount of $814.3 million is designated for swing line advances which may be drawn in euros pursuant to the terms of the 5-year credit agreement. borrowings bear interest at a floating rate plus an applicable margin dependent upon the denomination of the borrowing and specific terms of the 5-year credit agreement. the company must repay all advances under the 5-year credit agreement by the earlier of september 8, 2026 or upon termination. the 5-year credit agreement is designated to be a liquidity back-stop for the company's $3.5 billion u.s. dollar and euro commercial paper program. as of december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022, the company had not drawn on its five-year committed credit facility.
in september 2023, the company terminated its $1.5 billion syndicated 364-day credit agreement (the "syndicated 364-day credit agreement") dated september 2022, as amended. there were no outstanding borrowings under the syndicated 364-day credit agreement upon termination and as of december 31, 2022. contemporaneously, the company entered into a new $1.5 billion syndicated 364-day credit agreement (the "2023 syndicated 364-day credit agreement") which is a revolving credit loan. the borrowings under the 2023 syndicated 364-day credit agreement may be made in u.s. dollars or euros and bear interest at a floating rate plus an applicable margin dependent upon the denomination of the borrowing and pursuant to the terms of the 2023 syndicated 364-day credit agreement. the company must repay all advances under the 2023 syndicated 364-day credit agreement by the earlier of september 4, 2024 or upon termination. the company may, however, convert all advances outstanding upon termination into a term loan that shall be repaid in full no later than the first anniversary of the termination date provided that the company, among other things, pays a fee to the administrative agent for the account of each lender. the 2023 syndicated 364-day credit agreement serves as part of the liquidity back-stop for the company's $3.5 billion u.s. dollar and euro commercial paper program. as of december 30, 2023, the company had not drawn on its 2023 syndicated 364-day credit agreement.
in september 2023, the company terminated its $0.5 billion revolving credit loan (the "club 364-day credit agreement") dated september 2022, as amended. there were no outstanding borrowings under the club 364-day credit agreement upon termination and as of december 31, 2022.
in addition, the company has other short-term lines of credit that are primarily uncommitted, with numerous banks, aggregating $252 million, of which approximately $155 million was available at december 30, 2023. approximately $97 million of the short-term credit lines were utilized primarily pertaining to outstanding letters of credit for which there are no required or reported debt balances. short-term arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal.
at december 30, 2023, the aggregate amount of short-term and long-term committed and uncommitted lines of credit was approximately $4.3 billion. in addition, at december 30, 2023, $1.1 billion was recorded as short-term commercial paper borrowings. the weighted-average interest rates on u.s. dollar denominated short-term borrowings for the years ended december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022 were 5.1% and 2.3%, respectively. the weighted-average interest rate on euro denominated short-term borrowings for the year ended december 30, 2023 was 3.5%. for the year ended december 31, 2022, the company had not drawn on its euro denominated short-term borrowings.
the company has an interest coverage covenant that must be maintained to permit continued access to its committed credit facilities described above. the interest coverage ratio tested for covenant compliance compares adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to adjusted net interest expense ("adjusted ebitda"/"adjusted net interest expense"). in february 2023, the company entered into an amendment to its 5-year credit agreement to: (a) amend the definition of adjusted ebitda to allow for additional adjustment addbacks, not to exceed $500 million in the aggregate, for amounts incurred during each four fiscal quarter period beginning with the period ending in the third quarter of 2023 through the period ending in the second quarter of 2024, and (b) amend the minimum interest coverage ratio from 3.5 times to not less than 1.5 to 1.0 times computed quarterly, on a rolling twelve months (last twelve months) basis, for the period from and including the third quarter of 2023 through the second quarter of 2024. the minimum interest coverage ratio will revert back to 3.5 times for periods after the second quarter of 2024. the amended provisions described above also apply to the 2023 syndicated 364-day credit agreement.

in february 2022, the company issued $500.0 million of senior unsecured term notes maturing february 24, 2025 ("2025 term notes") and $500.0 million of senior unsecured term notes maturing may 15, 2032 ("2032 term notes"). the 2025 term notes accrue interest at a fixed rate of 2.3% per annum and the 2032 term notes at a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears, and rank equally in right of payment with all of the company's existing and future unsecured unsubordinated debt. the company received total net proceeds from this offering of approximately $993 million, net of approximately $7 million of underwriting expenses and other fees associated with the transaction. the company used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness under the commercial paper program.
in november 2019, the company issued 7,500,000 equity units with a total notional value of $750 million ("2019 equity units"). each unit had a stated amount of $100 and initially consisted of a three-year forward stock purchase contract ("2022 purchase contracts") for the purchase of a variable number of shares of common stock, on november 15, 2022, for a price of $100 per share, and a 10% beneficial ownership interest in one share of 0% series d cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock, without par, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share ("series d preferred stock").
in november 2022, the company generated cash proceeds of $750 million from the successful remarketing of the series d preferred stock (the "remarketed series d preferred stock"), as described more fully in note j, capital stock. upon completion of the remarketing, the holders of the 2019 equity units received 4,723,500 common shares and the company issued 750,000 shares of remarketed series d preferred stock. holders of the remarketed series d preferred stock were entitled to receive cumulative dividends, if declared by the board of directors, at an initial fixed rate equal to 7.5% per annum of the $1,000 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $75.00 per annum per share). on november 15, 2022, the company informed holders that it would redeem all outstanding shares of the remarketed series d preferred stock on december 22, 2022 (the "redemption date") at $1,007.71 per share in cash, which was equal to 100% of the liquidation preference of a share of remarketed series d preferred stock, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the redemption date. in december 2022, the company redeemed the remarketed series d preferred stock, paying $750 million in cash.

(a)future payments on long-term debt encompass all payments related to aggregate debt maturities, excluding certain fair value adjustments included in long-term debt, as discussed further in note h, long-term debt and financing arrangements.
(b)future interest payments on long-term debt reflect the applicable interest rate in effect at december 30, 2023.
(c)inventory purchase commitments primarily consist of open purchase orders to purchase raw materials, components, and sourced products.
(d)in march 2015, the company entered into a forward share purchase contract with a financial institution counterparty which obligates the company to pay $350 million, plus an additional amount related to the forward component of the contract. in november 2022, the company amended the settlement date to november 2024, or earlier at the company's option. see note j, capital stock, for further discussion.
(e)this amount principally represents contributions either required by regulations or laws or, with respect to unfunded plans, necessary to fund current benefits. the company has not presented estimated pension and post-retirement funding beyond 2024 as funding can vary significantly from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets, actuarial assumptions, and curtailment/settlement actions.
(f)income tax liability for the one-time deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings and profits.
(g)supplier agreements with long-term minimum material purchase requirements and freight forwarding arrangements.
(h)future cash flows on derivative instruments reflect the fair value and accrued interest as of december 30, 2023. the ultimate cash flows on these instruments will differ, perhaps significantly, based on applicable market interest and foreign currency rates at their maturity.
to the extent the company can reliably determine when payments will occur, the related amounts will be included in the table above. however, due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the contingent consideration liability related to the craftsman acquisition and the unrecognized tax liabilities of $209 million and $546 million, respectively, at december 30, 2023, the company is unable to make a reliable estimate of when (if at all) these amounts may be paid. refer to note m, fair value measurements, and note q, income taxes, for further discussion.
payments of the above contractual and other obligations (with the exception of payments related to debt principal, the forward stock purchase contract, and tax obligations) will typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow will be lower than the gross amounts summarized above.

market risk market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments, currencies, commodities and other items traded in global markets. the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, stock prices, bond prices and commodity prices, amongst others.
exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company, through its global businesses, enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies. the company's predominant currency exposures are related to the euro, canadian dollar, british pound, australian dollar, brazilian real, chinese renminbi and the taiwan dollar. certain cross-currency trade flows arising from both trade and affiliate sales and purchases are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include: purchased basket options, purchased options, collars, cross-currency swaps and currency forwards. the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection. at times, the company also enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impacts of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables, primarily for affiliate transactions. gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures. management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities, and in certain cases, may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain un-hedged. the company may also enter into cross-currency swaps and forward contracts to hedge the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements. management estimates the foreign currency impact from its derivative financial instruments outstanding at the end of 2023 would have been an incremental pre-tax loss of approximately $19 million based on a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions. the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions, and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes. the company generally does not hedge the translation of its non-u.s. dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries, but may choose to do so in certain instances in future periods.
as mentioned above, the company routinely has cross-border trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements. the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into u.s. dollars and the economic impact of foreign currency volatility on monetary assets held in foreign currencies. it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects. aside from the use of derivative instruments, which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure, transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take. for example, if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a u.s. supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier. management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact, on pre-tax earnings, of a 10% overall movement in exchange rates is approximately $217 million. in 2023, translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pre-tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $89 million.
the company's exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations, short-term investments, and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio. the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt, is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by leveraging, as appropriate, a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps, and cross-currency swaps.
the company's primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its commercial paper program in which the pricing is partially based on short-term u.s. interest rates. at december 30, 2023, the impact of a hypothetical 10% increase in the interest rates associated with the company's outstanding commercial paper borrowings would have been an incremental pre-tax loss of approximately $5 million.
the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses, particularly brass, nickel, resin, aluminum, copper, zinc, steel, and energy used in the production of finished goods. generally, commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments, but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions, procurement-driven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects.
the company has $104.7 million of liabilities as of december 30, 2023 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain u.s. employees for which there is mark-to-market exposure.
the assets held by the company's defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities, primarily global stocks and fixed-income securities. the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk. the company's investment strategy for pension assets focuses on a liability-matching approach with gradual de-risking taking place over a period of many years to effectively manage portfolio risk. the company utilizes the current funded status to transition the portfolio toward investments that better match the duration and cash flow attributes of the underlying liabilities. in 2023, investment gains resulted in an increase of $144 million to pension plan assets. in 2022 and 2021, investment returns on pension plan assets resulted in a decrease of $560 million and an increase $81 million, respectively. the funded status percentage (total plan assets divided by total projected benefit obligation) of all global pension plans was 87% in 2023, 2022 and 2021. the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately $35 million in 2024. management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate. refer to note l, employee benefit plans, for further discussion regarding the company's pension plans.
the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world. there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements solely due to a change in credit rating.
the company's existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity, including expected operating cash flows, are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal. the company believes that its strong financial position, expected operating cash flows, committed long-term credit facilities and borrowing capacity, and ability to access equity markets, provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments, to invest in the routine needs of its businesses, and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its business strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings.
critical accounting estimates - preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a, significant accounting policies. management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty. the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below. actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates.
goodwill and intangible assets - the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions. in accordance with accounting standards codification ("asc") 350-20, goodwill, acquired goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually or when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists. goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. at december 30, 2023, the company reported $7.996 billion of goodwill, $2.396 billion of indefinite-lived trade names and $1.553 billion of net definite-lived intangibles.
management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc 280, segment reporting, or one level below an operating segment (component level) as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics. if the carrying value of a reporting unit (including the value of goodwill) is greater than its estimated fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded for the amount that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value.
as required by the company's policy, goodwill was tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2023. in accordance with accounting standards update ("asu") 2011-08, intangibles - goodwill and other (topic 350): testing goodwill for impairment, companies are permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. impairment tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of the company's reporting units. for its annual impairment testing performed in the third quarter of 2023, the company applied a quantitative test for all of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow valuation model. based on the results of the company's annual impairment testing, it was determined that the fair value of each of its reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.
as previously disclosed in the company's form 10-q for the third quarter of 2023, the fair value of the engineered fastening   reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 16%. in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 30, 2023, the company performed an updated impairment analysis with respect to the engineered fastening reporting unit, which included approximately $2.020 billion of goodwill at year-end. the key assumptions applied to the updated cash flow projections for the engineered fastening reporting unit included a 10.0% discount rate, near-term revenue growth rates over the next six years, which represented a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5%, and a 3% perpetual growth rate. based on this analysis, it was determined that the fair value of the engineering fastening reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 22%. the increase in excess fair value is reflective of a slightly more favorable long-term outlook based on 2023 results and a lower carrying value driven by working capital reductions. management remains confident in the long-term viability and success of the engineered fastening reporting unit, particularly given its market position, growth prospects, such as automotive electrification and the aerospace market recovery, and geographies served.
as previously discussed, in december 2023, the company entered into an agreement to sell its infrastructure business. as a result, the company performed an impairment analysis with respect to the infrastructure reporting unit and recognized a $150.8 million pre-tax asset impairment charge to adjust the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group to its estimated fair value less selling costs. refer to note t, divestitures, for further discussion.
the company also tested its indefinite-lived trade names for impairment during the third quarter of 2023 utilizing a discounted cash flow model. the key assumptions used included discount rates, royalty rates, and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales. with the exception of the irwin and troy-bilt trade names discussed below, the company determined that the fair values of its indefinite-lived trade names exceeded their respective carrying amounts.
during the third quarter of 2023, as a result of new leadership within the tools & outdoor segment, the company reviewed its brand portfolio resulting in a decision to shift prioritization and investment to its major brands, while leveraging certain of its specialty brands in a more focused manner. as a result of this shift in brand prioritization, the company recognized a $124.0 million pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge related to the irwin and troy-bilt trade names in the third quarter of 2023. subsequent to this impairment charge, the carrying value of the irwin and troy-bilt trade names totaled $113.0 million. the company intends to continue utilizing these trade names, which accounted for less than 5% of 2023 net sales for the tools & outdoor segment, indefinitely in more focused product categories and end markets.
in the event that future operating results of any of the company's reporting units or indefinite-lived trade names do not meet current expectations, management, based upon conditions at the time, would consider taking restructuring or other strategic actions, as necessary, to maximize revenue growth and profitability. a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss would be appropriate.
defined benefit obligations - the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions. these assumptions, which are updated annually, include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future salary increase rates, and health care cost trend rates. the company considers current market conditions, including interest rates, to establish these assumptions. discount rates are developed considering the yields available on high-quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations. the company's weighted-average discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at december 30, 2023 for the united states and international pension plans were 5.04% and 4.43%, respectively. the company's weighted-average discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at december 31, 2022 for the united states and international pension plans were 5.36% and 4.70%, respectively. as discussed further in note l, employee benefit plans, the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors, which include its targeted asset allocation percentages, historic returns, and expected future returns. the company's expected rate of return assumptions for the united states and international pension plans were 6.70% and 5.29%, respectively, at december 30, 2023. the company will use a 5.99% weighted-average expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2024 net periodic benefit cost. a 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2024 net periodic benefit cost by approximately $4 million on a pre-tax basis.
the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company's financial position or results of operations. to the extent that actual (newly measured) results differ from the actuarial assumptions, the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and, if in excess of a specified corridor, amortized over future periods. the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets. accordingly, market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year. the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $314 million at december 30, 2023. a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately $53 million at december 30, 2023. the primary black & decker u.s. pension and post-employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010, as well as the only material black & decker international plan, and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans. the vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen; the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions. the company recognized approximately $29 million of defined benefit plan expense in 2023, which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets.
additional information regarding the company's pension plans is available in note l, employee benefit plans.
environmental - the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites. the company's policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties. as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available.
as of december 30, 2023, the company had reserves of $125 million for remediation activities associated with company-owned properties as well as for superfund sites, for losses that are probable and estimable. as of december 30, 2023, the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is $80 million to $227 million which is subject to change in the near term. the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns. liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy.
additional information regarding environmental matters is available in note s, contingencies.
income taxes - the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc 740, income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. any changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. in making this determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing temporary differences, estimates of future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards. in the event that it is determined that an asset is not more likely than not to be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded against the asset. valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made. conversely, if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period that the determination was made.
the company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc 740, which requires a two-step process. first, management determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and second, for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, management recognizes the largest amount of the tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related taxing authority. the company maintains an accounting policy of recording interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.
the company is subject to income tax in a number of locations, including u.s. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required when calculating the worldwide provision for income taxes. many factors are considered when evaluating and estimating the company's tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments, and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the company's unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. these changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits, litigation, or other proceedings with taxing authorities. the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information, which involves inherent uncertainty.
additional information regarding income taxes is available in note q, income taxes.

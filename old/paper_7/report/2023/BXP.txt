overview bxp is one of the largest publicly traded office real estate investment trusts (reits) (based on total market capitalization as of december 31, 2023) in the u.s. that develops, owns, and manages primarily premier workplaces. our properties are concentrated in six dynamic gateway markets in the u.s. - boston, los angeles, new york, san francisco, seattle, and washington, dc. bplp is the entity through which bxp conducts substantially all of its business and owns (either directly or through subsidiaries) substantially all of its assets. we generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing premier workplaces to our clients. when making leasing decisions, we consider, among other things, the creditworthiness of the client and the industry in which it conducts business, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid at inception and throughout the lease term, the amount of any security deposit or letter of credit posted by the client, the costs of tenant improvements, free rent periods and other landlord concessions, anticipated operating expenses and real estate taxes, current and anticipated vacancy in our properties and the market overall (including sublease space), current and expected future demand for the space, the impact of other clients' expansion rights, and general economic factors.
our core strategy has always been to develop, acquire and manage premier workplaces in gateway markets with high barriers-to-entry and attractive demand drivers, and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong clients that are diverse across market sectors. as of december 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term based on square feet (1) for our in-place leases, including those signed by our unconsolidated joint table of contents ventures but excluding residential units, was approximately 7.8 years, and (2) for our 20 largest clients was approximately 10.7 years.
to be successful in any leasing environment, we believe we must consider all aspects of the client-landlord relationship. in this regard, we believe we have a competitive leasing advantage that results from:
•our understanding of our client's short- and long-term space utilization and amenity needs in the local markets;
•our track record of developing and operating premier workplaces in a sustainable and responsible manner;
•our reputation as a high-quality developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in our markets;
•our financial strength, including our ability to fund our share of lease obligations and maintain premier building standards; and
•our relationships with local brokers.
outlook the u.s. economy continued to grow during the fourth quarter of 2023, with the gross domestic product growing at a 3.3% annual rate in the fourth quarter. while the year also ended with continued low unemployment and cooling inflation, the economic statistics may not accurately reflect the market sentiment and operating environment facing many of our clients, as well as bxp, as we look ahead to 2024 and beyond.
in 2023, the u.s. office markets experienced overall negative leasing absorption, including in all of our coastal markets, as well as the major sunbelt and midwest markets. according to recent labor statistics, the u.s. added 333,000 jobs in december, however, only approximately 8% of those jobs were categorized as professional and business services, which are drivers of demand for premier workplace space. despite the slowed pace of job reductions from this time last year, we continue to see employee layoff announcements across a wide variety of industries, particularly technology. as a result, although the u.s. economy may not enter a technical recession, we do not expect that a soft landing will stimulate an increase in office-using employment or in leasing absorption in 2024.
remote work continues to be a factor restraining demand for office space, though we believe macroeconomic conditions are the primary driver of leasing activity and that our leasing, in particular, is driven by corporate earnings growth. the s&p 500's trailing 10-year average annual earnings growth rate from 2013-2022 was 8.4%, as compared to 2023 where, earnings growth is projected to be less than 1%. s&p 500 companies are expected to increase earnings by over 9% in 2024. as overall earnings growth for our clients and potential clients improves, it should lead to employment growth and demand for office space over time. however, we are not counting on a near-term market recovery to maintain our occupancy. our leasing, construction and property management teams will lean on our operating prowess to gain new clients and market share as clients choose premier workplaces that are in sound financial condition for their office space.
the evolving operating environment impacts various aspects of our operating activities as:
•labor market conditions shift, resulting in increasing employer demands for mandatory in-person workdays;
•volatility in the capital markets has led companies to be more reticent in capital outlays, including capital required for leasing new space;
•our capital costs have increased due to higher interest rates and credit spreads, and private market debt financing, both for construction and existing assets, is significantly more challenging to arrange; and
•construction costs have increased and, although much of the cost for our active development pipeline is fixed, the cost of potential future construction activity continues to increase.
in light of the uncertain trajectory of the u.s. and global economies, we believe we continue to position bxp for success by increasing liquidity, managing our leverage, pursuing additional capital raising opportunities and maintaining discipline in discretionary capital expenditures, while continuing to selectively invest (including through both acquisitions and developments) in premier workplace opportunities. we remain focused on the following strategies:

•continuing to embrace our leadership position in the premier workplace segment and leveraging our strength in portfolio quality, client relationships, development skills, market penetration and sustainability to profitably build market share. premier workplaces, the preferred choice for our current and prospective clients, are gaining market share compared to general office space and continue to demonstrate the highest occupancy, net absorption levels and rental rates in the central business districts ("cbds") in markets where we operate;
•leasing available space in our in-service and development properties, as well as proactively focusing on future lease expirations;
•completing the construction and leasing of our development properties;
•pursuing attractive asset class adjacencies where we have a track record of success, such as life sciences and residential development;
•continuing to raise the bar in the quality of our portfolio and actively recycling capital by selling assets, subject to market conditions, which have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by a slowdown in the capital markets and the limited availability of private market debt financing;
•actively managing our operations in a sustainable and responsible manner; and
•prioritizing risk management by actively managing liquidity, investing more extensively with joint venture partners to manage our debt levels, and being highly selective in new investment commitments.
the following is an overview of leasing and investment activity in the fourth quarter of 2023 and recent business highlights.
leasing activity and occupancy the macroeconomic environment has resulted in softening demand in all of our markets. while property tours continue and lease negotiations move forward, there is less urgency from clients to make new commitments. potential clients touring space acknowledge that economic uncertainty is impacting space decisions.
in the fourth quarter of 2023, we signed more than 1.5 million square feet of leases with a weighted-average lease term of approximately 8.4 years, for a total of approximately 4.2 million square feet leased in 2023 with a weighted-average lease term of 8.2 years. this is the third consecutive quarter that leasing has increased, underscoring the demand for premier workplaces despite the challenging market.
the overall occupancy of our in-service premier workplace and retail properties was 88.4% at december 31, 2023, a decrease of 40 basis points from september 30, 2023. we define occupancy as space with signed leases for which revenue recognition has commenced in accordance with gaap. including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced revenue recognition in accordance with gaap, our in-service premier workplace and retail properties were approximately 89.9% leased at december 31, 2023.
investment activity we continually evaluate current and prospective markets for possible acquisitions of "value-add" assets that require lease-up or repositioning, and acquisitions that are otherwise consistent with our long-term strategy of owning, managing, developing, and improving premier workplaces in each of our chosen markets. we expect to see more opportunities to make investments in this environment, and we remain committed to developing and acquiring assets to enhance our long-term growth and to meet current and future client demand for premier workplaces, life sciences, and residential development.
consistent with this strategy, we purchased our partners' interests in three assets from two different joint venture partners, one of which closed in early january 2024.
•we completed the acquisition of our joint venture partner's 45% ownership interest in santa monica business park located in santa monica, california. the acquisition was completed for a gross purchase price of $38.0 million, and we acquired net working capital, including cash and cash equivalents of approximately $20 million, as well as the partner's share of the outstanding $300.0 million mortgage debt. subsequent to closing, we extended an approximately 467,000 square foot lease with anchor client, snap inc. through 2036. santa monica business park is a 47-acre office park consisting of 21 buildings and totaling approximately 1.2 million net rentable square feet. approximately 70% of the square footage is subject to a ground lease having a remaining term of approximately 75 years, inclusive of renewal options table of contents that are subject to certain conditions. under the ground lease, we have a purchase option at fair market value in 2028 (see notes 3, 4, and 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
•we completed the acquisition of one of our joint venture partner's approximate 29% ownership interest in 360 park avenue south located in new york city, new york for a purchase price of $1. we now own approximately 71% of the joint venture. we also assumed the partner's share of the joint venture's cash and working capital aggregating approximately $25.4 million, as well as the partner's share of the outstanding $220.0 million mortgage debt. 360 park avenue south is a 20-story, approximately 450,000 square foot premier workplace that is currently under redevelopment (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).
•on january 8, 2024, we completed the acquisition of our joint venture partner's 50% economic ownership interest in 901 new york avenue located in washington, dc for a purchase price of $10.0 million. we also assumed the partner's share of the outstanding approximately $207.1 million mortgage debt, which bears interest at 3.61% per annum and matures on january 5, 2025. on january 11, 2024, we modified the mortgage loan to provide for two loan extension options totaling five years of additional term, each subject to certain conditions. the first loan extension option is four years at a fixed interest rate of 5.0% per annum. also, we extended an approximately 200,000 square foot lease with anchor client, finnegan henderson farabow garrett & dunner, l.l.p. through 2042. 901 new york avenue is a premier workplace consisting of approximately 548,000 net rentable square feet.
these transactions were sparked, in part, by lease extensions at two of the properties and further motivated by our partners electing to reduce their exposure to and investment in the office sector. we believe we purchased their interests on attractive terms.
also in the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into agreements to sell a 45% interest in each of 290 binney street and 300 binney street, two life sciences development projects located in kendall square in cambridge, massachusetts, to an institutional investor at a gross valuation of approximately $1.66 billion or $2,050 per square foot. the properties total approximately 802,000 square feet and each is 100% pre-leased. we completed the sale of a 45% interest in 300 binney street upon entry into the agreement in november 2023. we will provide development, property management, and leasing services for the ventures. the institutional investor funded approximately $212.9 million at closing for its 45% investment in 300 binney street and, upon closing of its 45% investment in 290 binney street, their investment will reduce our estimated future development spend over time by approximately $533.5 million (see notes 3 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements).
as of december 31, 2023, our development/redevelopment pipeline consisted of 10 properties that, when completed, we expect will total approximately 2.7 million net rentable square feet. our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately $2.4 billion, of which approximately $1.3 billion remains to be invested. the commercial space in the pipeline, which excludes skymark - reston next residential, was 53% pre-leased as of february 20, 2024.
as we continue to focus on new investments to drive future growth, we regularly review our portfolio to identify properties as potential sales candidates that either no longer fit within our portfolio strategy or could attract premium pricing in the current market, as evidenced by the partial interest sale of 300 binney street during the fourth quarter of 2023 and anticipated partial interest sale of 290 binney street. however, the asset sale market for all real estate asset classes has slowed dramatically with the increase in interest rates and transaction volume for office assets continues to be minimal in the u.s.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, or gaap, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. from time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. our significant accounting policies, which utilize these critical accounting estimates, are described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
we consider our critical accounting estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following:
•purchase price allocations,
•impairment and
•impairment related to unconsolidated joint ventures.
each of the above critical accounting estimates is described in more detail below.
real estate purchase price allocations we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, "above-" and "below-market" leases, leasing and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities (including ground leases)) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the clients, the clients' credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.
table of contents we record acquired "above-" and "below-market" leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. acquired "above-" and "below-market" lease values have been reflected within prepaid expenses and other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each client's lease. factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. in estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. in estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, we completed the acquisition of our joint venture partner's 45% interest in the joint venture entity that owns santa monica business park located in santa monica, california, for a gross purchase price of approximately $38.0 million. this transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition, and the purchase price was allocated based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
impairment management reviews its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment following the end of each quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. this evaluation of long-lived assets is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the long-lived asset or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or hold period. an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold periods, future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, discount rates and capitalization rates that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. because cash flows on properties considered to be "long-lived assets to be held and used" are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset may be impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. if our hold strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate a shorter hold period, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. if we determine that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value.
unconsolidated joint ventures impairment our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying amounts has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. this evaluation of the investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value below the carrying amount of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary. the fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows which is subjective and considers assumptions regarding future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, debt interest rates and availability, discount rates and capitalization rates that could differ materially from actual results in future periods.
as of december 31, 2023, the net carrying amounts of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was approximately $1.3 billion, which includes investments with deficit balances aggregating approximately $39.9 million included within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our investments in platform 16, 360 park avenue south, 200 fifth avenue and safeco plaza of approximately $155.2 million, $54.0 million, $33.4 million and $29.9 million, respectively (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).

at december 31, 2023 and 2022, we owned or had joint venture interests in a portfolio of 188 and 194 commercial real estate properties, respectively (in each case, the "total property portfolio"). as a result of changes within our total property portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the total property portfolio provides a complete understanding of our operating results. therefore, the comparison of operating results for the year ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us and in-service throughout each period compared (the "same property portfolio") and the changes attributable to the properties included in the acquired, placed in-service, in or held for development or redevelopment or sold portfolios.
in our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of noi between periods more meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. we refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us and in-service through the end of the latest period presented as our same property portfolio. the same property portfolio therefore excludes properties acquired, placed in-service or in or held for development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented.
table of contents noi is a non-gaap financial measure equal to net income attributable to boston properties, inc. and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership, as applicable, the most directly comparable gaap financial measures, plus (1) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, losses from interest rate contracts, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures, depreciation and amortization expense, transaction costs, payroll and related costs from management services contracts and corporate general and administrative expense less (2) unrealized gain (loss) on non-real estate investment, gains (losses) from investments in securities, other income - assignment fee, interest and other income (loss), gain on sales-type lease, gains on sales of real estate, direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts and development and management services revenue. we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe it provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and financial condition because, when compared across periods, it reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to boston properties, inc. and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. similarly, interest expense may be incurred at the property level even though the financing proceeds may be used at the corporate level (e.g., used for other investment activity). in addition, depreciation and amortization expense, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance measures at the property level. noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits or real estate companies that define noi differently.
we believe that in order to understand our operating results, noi should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties, inc. and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership as presented in our consolidated financial statements. noi should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to boston properties, inc. or net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership (determined in accordance with gaap) or any other gaap financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
the gains on sales of real estate and depreciation expense may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor redemptions of common units of limited partnership interest of bplp ("op units"). this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties. the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in gains on sales of real estate and depreciation expense when those properties are sold. for additional information see the explanatory note that immediately follows the cover page of this annual report on form 10-k.
comparison of the year ended december 31, 2023 to the year ended december 31, 2022
the table below shows selected operating information for the same property portfolio and the total property portfolio. the same property portfolio consists of 125 properties totaling approximately 38.3 million net rentable square feet, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures. the same property portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to january 1, 2022 and owned and in service through december 31, 2023. the total property portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either acquired, placed in-service, in or held for development or redevelopment after january 1, 2022 or disposed of on or prior to december 31, 2023. this table includes a reconciliation from the same property portfolio to the total property portfolio by also providing information for the year ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 with respect to the properties that were acquired, placed in-service, in or held for development or redevelopment or sold.

(1)average monthly rental rate is calculated as the average of the quotients obtained by dividing (a) rental revenue as determined in accordance with gaap, by (b) the number of occupied units for each month within the applicable fiscal period.
(2)average physical occupancy is defined as (1) the average number of occupied units divided by (2) the total number of units, expressed as a percentage.
(3)average economic occupancy is defined as (1) total possible revenue less vacancy loss divided by (2) total possible revenue, expressed as a percentage. total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at market rents. vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents. by measuring vacant units at their market rents, average economic occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential property's total possible gross revenue. market rents used by us in calculating economic occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential property's units and publicly available market data. actual market rents and trends in such rents for a region as reported by others may vary materially from market rents used by us. market rents for a period are based on the average market rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.

other operating revenue and expense items development and management services revenue development and management services revenue increased by approximately $12.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to 2022. development services revenue and management services revenue increased by approximately $5.0 million and $7.8 million, respectively. the increase in development services revenue was primarily related to an increase in development fees earned from unconsolidated joint ventures in the washington, dc region and an increase in fees associated with tenant improvement projects earned from a third-party owned building and a consolidated joint venture in the new york region. the increase in management services revenue was primarily related to an increase in property management fees earned from a third-party owned building in the washington, dc region and an unconsolidated joint venture in the new york region. the increase in management services revenue was also related to an increase in asset management fees earned from an unconsolidated joint venture in the los angeles region and leasing commission fees earned from an unconsolidated joint venture in the new york region.
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased by approximately $23.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to increases in compensation expense and other general and administrative expenses of approximately $21.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively. the increase in compensation expense related to (1) an approximately $12.1 million increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan and (2) an approximately $9.1 million increase in other compensation expenses, primarily due to age-based vesting and annual increases in employee compensation. the increase in other general and administrative expenses primarily related to an increase in professional fees.
wages directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the applicable asset or lease table of contents term. capitalized wages for each of the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $16.1 million. these costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above.
transaction costs transaction costs increased by approximately $1.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to 2022. in general, transaction costs relating to the formation of new joint ventures and the pursuit of other transactions are expensed as incurred.
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor op unit redemptions by bplp.  this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties.  the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense. for additional information see the explanatory note that immediately follows the cover page of this annual report on form 10-k.

direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts and payroll and related costs from management service contracts we have determined that amounts reimbursed for payroll and related costs received from third parties in connection with management services contracts should be reflected on a gross basis instead of on a net basis as we have determined that we are the principal under these arrangements. we anticipate that these two financial statement line items will generally offset each other.
other income and expense items loss from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to 2022, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately $179.7 million primarily due to an approximately $272.6 million non-cash impairment charge (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). this increase was partially offset by (1) an approximately $34.3 million net gain related to the disposition of our interest in metropolitan square, (2) an approximately $29.9 million gain on consolidation related to the acquisition of our joint venture partner's interest in our santa monica business park joint venture during the year ended december 31, 2023 (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements), and (3) an approximately $50.7 million non-cash impairment charge at our dock 72 joint venture during the year ended december 31, 2022.

(2)excludes approximately $0.7 million of gains on sales of real estate recognized during the year ended december 31, 2022 related to gain amounts from sales of real estate occurring in the prior year.
gain on sales-type lease in connection with a ground lease amendment, executed on december 19, 2022 with a third-party hotel developer, we recorded a sales-type lease receivable of approximately $13.0 million, which includes an unguaranteed residual asset of approximately $17,000. the sales-type lease receivable was measured as the present value of the fixed and determinable lease payments, including the unguaranteed residual value of the asset at the end of the lease, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease. in addition, we recorded a gain on sales-type lease of approximately $10.1 million associated with the derecognition of the asset.
interest and other income (loss)
interest and other income (loss) increased by approximately $58.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to 2022, due primarily to an increase of approximately $58.6 million in interest income due to increased interest earned on our deposits partially offset by an increase in our allowance for current expected credit losses of approximately $0.6 million.
other income - assignment fee on april 19, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire 11251 roger bacon drive in reston, virginia for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.6 million. on april 7, 2022, we executed an agreement to assign the right to acquire 11251 roger bacon drive to a third party for an assignment fee of approximately $6.9 million. net cash proceeds totaled approximately $6.6 million. 11251 roger bacon drive is an approximately 65,000 square foot office building situated on approximately 2.6 acres.
gains (losses) from investments in securities gains (losses) from investments in securities for the year ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to deferred compensation plans that we maintain for bxp's officers and former non-employee directors. under the deferred compensation plans, each officer or non-employee director who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer's current income or the non-employee director's compensation on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer or non-employee director. in order to table of contents reduce our market risk relating to these plans, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer or non-employee director. this enables us to generally match our liabilities to bxp's officers or former non-employee directors under our deferred compensation plans with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. the performance of these investments is recorded as gains (losses) from investments in securities. during the year ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized gains (losses) of approximately $5.6 million and $(6.5) million, respectively, on these investments. by comparison, our general and administrative expense increased (decreased) by approximately $5.6 million and $(6.5) million during the year ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as a result of increases (decreases) in our liability under our deferred compensation plans that was associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by officers and former non-employee directors of bxp participating in the plans.
unrealized gain (loss) on non-real estate investment during the year ended december 31, 2022, we began investing in non-real estate investments, which are primarily environmentally focused investment funds. during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized an unrealized gain (loss) of approximately $0.2 million and $(0.2) million, respectively, due to the observable changes in the fair value of the investments.
losses from interest rate contracts during the year ended december 31, 2023, to satisfy a lender requirement, we entered into two agreements with the same third-party to purchase and sell a $600.0 million interest rate cap. we did not elect hedge accounting, and as such, any change in market value will be recognized at the end of the period. for the year ended december 31, 2023, we recognized approximately $79,000 of loss from entering into these agreements.

(1)consists of the mortgage loan collateralized by the 325 main street, 355 main street, 90 broadway and cambridge east garage (also known as kendall center green garage) properties located in cambridge, massachusetts, and the table of contents mortgage loan and fair value debt adjustment for santa monica business park located in santa monica, california (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is capitalized and included in real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate or lease term. as portions of properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest on that portion and interest is then expensed. interest capitalized for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $42.6 million and $52.1 million, respectively. these costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. the decrease in capitalized interest is primarily attributable to a development project that had a finance lease and is now placed in service.
on february 1, 2024, bplp completed the repayment of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.800% senior notes due february 1, 2024. the repayment was completed with available cash and the $600 million proceeds from the mortgage loan entered into on october 26, 2023 (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). the repayment price was approximately $713.3 million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately $13.3 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repayment date. excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the repayment price was equal to the principal amount being repaid.
at december 31, 2023, our variable rate debt consisted of bplp's $1.815 billion revolving credit facility (the "revolving facility") under its $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility (the "2021 credit facility"), $1.2 billion unsecured term loan drawn by bplp in january 2023 (the "2023 unsecured term loan"), $900 million collateralized by santa monica business park and our 325 main street, 355 main street, 90 broadway and kendall center green garage properties. as of december 31, 2023, the revolving facility did not have a balance outstanding. the other variable rate debt has all been hedged with interest rates swaps to fix sofr for all, or a portion of the applicable debt term. for a summary of our consolidated debt as of december 31, 2023 refer to the heading "liquidity and capital resources-debt financing" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."

noncontrolling interest-common units of the operating partnership for bxp, noncontrolling interest-common units of the operating partnership decreased by approximately $74.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to a decrease in allocable income, which was primarily the result of recognizing a non-cash impairment charge related to our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures during 2023 and a greater gain on sales of real estate amount during 2022. due to our ownership structure, there is no corresponding line item on bplp's financial statements.
table of contents liquidity and capital resources general our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to:
•fund normal recurring expenses;
•meet debt service and principal repayment obligations and balloon payments on maturing debt, including the $1.2 billion 2023 unsecured term loan maturing may 16, 2024 (unless we exercise the one-year extension option, subject to certain conditions) and $850 million of 3.200% unsecured senior notes due january 15, 2025;
•fund development and redevelopment costs;
•fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs;
•fund possible acquisitions of properties, either directly or indirectly through the acquisition of equity interests; and
•make the minimum distribution required to enable bxp to maintain its reit qualification under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.
we expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following:
•cash flow from operations;
•distribution of cash flows from joint ventures;
•cash and cash equivalent balances;
•borrowings under bplp's revolving facility, unsecured term loans, short-term bridge facilities and construction loans;
•long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness);
•sales of real estate and interests in joint ventures owning real estate;
•private equity sources, including institutional investors; and
•issuances of bxp equity securities and/or preferred or common units of partnership interests in bplp.
we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. we expect to fund our current development/redevelopment properties primarily with our available cash balances, funding from institutional private equity partners, construction loans, unsecured term loans, proceeds from asset sales and bplp's revolving facility. we use bplp's revolving facility primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, refinance outstanding indebtedness and meet short-term development and working capital needs. although we may seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may require guarantees by bplp, the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the project's size and duration, whether the project is owned by a joint venture, the extent of pre-leasing, our available cash and access to cost effective capital at the given time.

(2)each of investment to date, estimated total investment and estimated future equity requirement represent our share of acquisition expenses, as applicable, and reflect our share of the estimated net revenue/expenses that we expect to incur prior to stabilization of the project, including any amounts actually received or paid through december 31, 2023.
(3)includes approximately $138.7 million of unpaid but accrued construction costs and leasing commissions.
(4)excludes approximately $138.7 million of unpaid but accrued construction costs and leasing commissions.
(5)represents percentage leased as of february 20, 2024, including leases with future commencement dates.
(6)on december 14, 2023, we acquired an additional 29% ownership interest in the property, which has increased our total ownership to 71%. investment to date excludes approximately $54.0 million of an impairment charge (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).
(7)as of december 31, 2023, this property was 4% placed in-service.
(8)as of december 31, 2023, this property was 46% placed in-service.

(9)on november 13, 2023, we entered into a joint venture with an institutional investor who funded approximately $212.9 million at closing for its investment. we withdrew approximately $212.9 million at closing and will fund all future costs of the project (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).
(10)on november 13, 2023, we entered into an agreement with an institutional investor to sell a 45% interest in 290 binney street. upon closing of the partial interest sale, our share of estimated future development spend will be reduced over time by approximately $533.5 million.
(11)percentage leased excludes the residential property.
table of contents lease revenue (which includes reimbursement of operating expenses from clients, if any), other income from operations, available cash balances, proceeds from mortgage financings and offerings of unsecured indebtedness, draws on bplp's revolving facility, and funding from institutional private equity partners are the principal sources of capital that we use to fund operating expenses, debt service, development and redevelopment activities, maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures, tenant improvements and the minimum distribution required to enable bxp to maintain its reit qualification. we seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing client turnover and controlling operating expenses. our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing, development and construction businesses, interest earned on cash deposits and, from time to time, the sale of assets. we believe these sources of capital will continue to provide the funds necessary for our short-term liquidity needs. material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows.
we expect our primary uses of capital over the next twelve months will be to fund our current and committed development and redevelopment projects, repay debt maturities (as discussed below), make interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, and satisfy our reit distribution requirements.
as of december 31, 2023, we had 10 properties under development or redevelopment. our share of the estimated total investment for these projects is approximately $2.4 billion, of which approximately $1.3 billion remains to be funded primarily with equity through 2027. during 2023, we completed the development/redevelopment of:
•2100 pennsylvania avenue, an approximately 476,000 net rentable square foot premier workplace located in washington, dc, for an estimated total investment of $394.9 million. including leases with future commencement dates, the property was 95% leased as of december 31, 2023.
•view boston observatory, a panoramic three-floor observatory at the top of 800 boylston street - the prudential tower in boston, massachusetts, for an estimated total investment of $182.3 million.
•140 kendrick street - building a, a premier workplace redevelopment project with approximately 104,000 net rentable square feet located in needham, massachusetts, for an estimated total investment of $21.9 million. the property is the first net-zero, carbon-neutral office repositioning of its scale in massachusetts. the property is 100% leased as of december 31, 2023.
•751 gateway, a laboratory/life sciences property with approximately 231,000 net rentable square feet in south san francisco, california, for an estimated total investment of $127.6 million. we own this property through a joint venture entity in which we own a 49% interest. the property is 100% leased as of december 31, 2023.
since september 30, 2023, we further strengthened our balance sheet through sourcing additional liquidity. notable transactions include:
•on november 13, 2023, we entered into agreements to sell a 45% interest in each of 290 binney street and 300 binney street, two life science development projects located in kendall square in cambridge, massachusetts, to an institutional investor at a gross valuation of approximately $1.66 billion or $2,050 per square foot. the properties total approximately 802,000 net rentable square feet, and each is 100% pre-leased. we will provide development, property management, and leasing services for the joint ventures. the institutional investor funded approximately $212.9 million at closing for its 45% investment in 300 binney street (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements) and, upon closing of its 45% investment in 290 binney street, the institutional investor's investment will reduce bxp's estimated future development spend over time by approximately $533.5 million.
•on october 26, 2023, we closed on a $600 million mortgage loan collateralized by our 325 main street, 355 main street, 90 broadway and cambridge east garage (also known as kendall center green garage) properties located in cambridge, massachusetts. the mortgage loan, totaling $600 million, requires interest-only payments at daily compounded sofr plus 2.25% per annum until maturity on october 26, 2028. on december 7, 2023, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix daily compounded sofr at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of approximately 3.79% for an all-in interest rate of 6.04% for this mortgage loan.

•on february 1, 2024, we repaid at maturity our 3.800% unsecured senior notes at par utilizing available cash and the proceeds from the aforementioned $600 million mortgage loan. the repayment price was approximately $713.3 million, which included the stated principal of $700 million plus approximately $13.3 million of accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the repayment date.
our consolidated debt maturities through january 31, 2025 include the $1.2 billion 2023 unsecured term loan that matures on may 16, 2024 (unless we exercise the one-year extension option, subject to certain conditions) and $850 million aggregate principal amount of bplp's 3.200% unsecured senior notes due january 15, 2025. in our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio, we have approximately $343.2 million (our share) of debt maturing in 2024. we expect to fund the foregoing debt maturities using available cash balances, proceeds from asset sales, draws on bplp's revolving facility, and/or through refinancings using secured debt or unsecured debt, or both. we expect our net interest expense will increase in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher interest rates on outstanding debt and debt that we refinance, and lower interest income as we use cash balances to repay debt and fund our development pipeline.
as of february 20, 2024, we had available cash of approximately $533.1 million (of which approximately $104.0 million is attributable to our consolidated joint venture partners). our liquidity and capital resources depend on a wide range of factors, and we believe that our access to capital and our strong liquidity, including the approximately $1.8 billion available under bplp's revolving facility and our available cash, as of february 20, 2024, are sufficient to fund our remaining capital needs on existing development and redevelopment projects, fund acquisitions, repay our maturing indebtedness when due (if not refinanced or extended), satisfy our reit distribution requirements and still allow us to act opportunistically on attractive investment opportunities.
we may seek to enhance our liquidity to fund our current and future development activity, pursue additional attractive investment opportunities and refinance or repay indebtedness. depending on interest rates, the overall conditions in the public and private debt and equity markets, and our leverage at the time, we may decide to access one or more of these capital sources. doing so may result in us carrying additional cash and cash equivalents pending our use of the proceeds, which would increase our net interest expense.
on may 17, 2023, bxp renewed its atm stock offering program through which it may sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $600.0 million of its common stock through sales agents over a three-year period. under the atm stock offering program, bxp may also engage in forward sale transactions with affiliates of certain sales agents for the sale of its common stock on a forward basis. bxp intends to use the net proceeds from any offering for general business purposes, which may include investment opportunities and debt reduction. we have not sold any shares under this atm stock offering program.
inflation we are exposed to inflation risk, as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. there are provisions in the majority of our client leases that protect us from, and mitigate the risk of, the impact of inflation. these provisions include rent steps and resets to market, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per-square-foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per-square-foot allowance. however, due to the long-term nature of the leases, the rent may not increase frequently enough to fully cover inflation.
reit tax distribution considerations dividend bxp as a reit is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that bxp currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income (excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments). our policy is for bxp to distribute at least 100% of its taxable income, including capital gains, to avoid paying federal tax. common and ltip unitholders (other than unearned myltip units) of limited partnership interest in bplp receive the same distribution per unit that is paid per share of bxp common stock.
bxp's board of directors will continue to evaluate bxp's dividend rate in light of our actual and projected taxable income (including gains on sales), liquidity requirements and other circumstances, and there can be no assurance that the future dividends declared by bxp's board of directors will not differ materially from the current quarterly dividend amount.
table of contents sales to the extent that we sell assets at a gain and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, bxp would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of bxp's common stock and reit distribution requirements. at a minimum, we expect that bxp would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for bxp to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales.
from time to time in select cases, whether due to a change in use, structuring issues to comply with applicable reit regulations or other reasons, we may sell an asset that is held by a taxable reit subsidiary ("trs"). such a sale by a trs would be subject to federal and local taxes.
cash flow summary the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.
cash and cash equivalents and cash held in escrows aggregated approximately $1.6 billion and $736.8 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $875.8 million. the following table sets forth changes in cash flows:

our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our properties. the weighted-average term of our in-place leases, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures, excluding residential units, was approximately 7.8 years as of december 31, 2023, with occupancy rates historically in the range of 88% to 92%. generally, our properties generate a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund regular quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. in addition, over the past several years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties and through secured and unsecured borrowings.
cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures. we selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings to enhance or maintain our market position. cash used in investing activities for the years ended december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022 is detailed below:

table of contents consolidated debt to consolidated market capitalization ratio is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the reit sector. we present this measure as a percentage and it is calculated by dividing (a) our consolidated debt by (b) our consolidated market capitalization, which is the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our consolidated debt. consolidated market capitalization is the sum of:
(1) our consolidated debt; plus
(2) the product of (x) the closing price per share of bxp common stock on december 29, 2023, as reported by the new york stock exchange, multiplied by (y) the sum of:
(i) the number of outstanding shares of common stock of bxp,
(ii) the number of outstanding op units in bplp (excluding op units held by bxp),
(iii) the number of op units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding ltip units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the ltip units, and
(iv) the number of op units issuable upon conversion of 2012 opp units, and 2013 - 2020 myltip units that were issued in the form of ltip units.
the calculation of consolidated market capitalization does not include ltip units issued in the form of myltip awards unless and until certain performance thresholds are achieved and they are earned. because their three-year performance periods have not yet ended, 2021 - 2023 myltip units are not included in this calculation as of december 31, 2023.
we also present bxp's share of market capitalization and bxp's share of debt/bxp's share of market capitalization, which are calculated in the same manner, except that bxp's share of debt is utilized instead of our consolidated debt in both the numerator and the denominator. bxp's share of debt is defined as our consolidated debt plus our share of debt from our unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon our ownership percentage), minus our partners' share of debt from our consolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the partners' percentage ownership interests adjusted for basis differentials). management believes that bxp's share of debt provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition because it includes our share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and excludes our partners' share of debt from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. we have several significant joint ventures and presenting various measures of financial condition in this manner can help investors better understand our financial condition and/or results of operations after taking into account our economic interest in these joint ventures.  we caution investors that the ownership percentages used in calculating bxp's share of debt may not completely and accurately depict all of the legal and economic implications of holding an interest in a consolidated or unconsolidated joint venture. for example, in addition to partners' interests in profits and capital, venture agreements vary in the allocation of rights regarding decision making (both for routine and major decisions), distributions, transferability of interests, financing and guarantees, liquidations and other matters.  moreover, in some cases we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, the joint venture in which case gaap requires that we account for the joint venture entity using the equity method of accounting and we do not consolidate it for financial reporting purposes. in other cases, gaap requires that we consolidate the venture even though our partner(s) own(s) a significant percentage interest. as a result, management believes that the presentation of bxp's share of a financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, and should only be considered with and as a supplement to our financial information presented in accordance with gaap.
we present these supplemental ratios because our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes and because different investors and lenders consider one or both of these ratios. investors should understand that these ratios are, in part, a function of the market price of the common stock of bxp and as such will fluctuate with changes in such price, and they do not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. however, for a company like bxp, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, these ratios may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as they are evaluated along with the ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts and other financial ratios, as well as the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.

debt financing as of december 31, 2023, we had approximately $15.9 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness, representing approximately 56.28% of our consolidated market capitalization as calculated above consisting of approximately (1) $10.5 billion (net of discount and deferred financing fees) in publicly traded unsecured senior notes having a gaap weighted-average interest rate of 3.91% per annum and maturities in 2024 through 2034 (see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements), (2) $4.2 billion (net of deferred financing fees and fair value interest adjustment) of property-specific mortgage debt having a gaap weighted-average interest rate of 4.09% per annum and a weighted-average term of 4.6 years (see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements) and (3) $1.2 billion outstanding under bplp's 2023 unsecured term loan that matures on may 16, 2024.

(3)at december 31, 2023, the $1.2 billion 2023 unsecured term loan and two of our mortgage loans aggregating approximately $900.0 million bore interest at variable rates. we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively fixed the variability of these loans for all or a portion of the applicable debt term and as such, they are reflected in our fixed rate statistics (see notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements).
unsecured credit facility the 2021 credit facility provides for borrowings of up to $1.815 billion, as described below, through the revolving facility, subject to customary conditions. the 2021 credit facility matures on june 15, 2026 and includes a sustainability-linked pricing component. under the 2021 credit facility, bplp may increase the total commitment by up to $500.0 million by increasing the amount of the revolving facility and/or by incurring one or more term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions (the "accordion"). on september 28, 2023, bplp exercised a portion of the accordion with three new lenders to the 2021 credit facility (the "new lenders"). each of the new lenders entered into a lender agreement with bplp to provide an aggregate table of contents of $315.0 million in additional revolving credit commitments, which increased the maximum borrowing amount under the 2021 credit facility from $1.5 billion to $1.815 billion. all other terms of the 2021 credit facility remain unchanged.

_______________
(1)the gaap interest rate differs from the stated interest rate due to the inclusion of the amortization of financing charges, the effects of hedging transactions (if any) and adjustments required under accounting standards codification 805 "business combinations" to reflect loans at their fair values (if any).
(2)the mortgage loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity.
(3)the mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate of sofr plus 1.38% per annum. the borrower under the loan entered into three interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $300.0 million to fix sofr at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 2.679% for the period commencing on february 1, 2023 and ending on april 1, 2025. stated interest rate reflects the weighted average fixed interest rate based on the interest rate swap contracts plus 1.38% per annum (see notes 3, 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements). deferred financing costs, net includes approximately $4.4 million of fair value interest adjustment.
(4)the mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate of daily compounded sofr plus 2.25% per annum. on december 7, 2023, bplp entered into three interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $600.0 million to fix daily compounded sofr at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 3.7925% for the period commencing on december 15, 2023 and ending on october 26, 2028. stated interest rate reflects the weighted average fixed interest rate based on the interest rate swap contracts plus 2.25% per annum (see notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements).
(5)this property is owned by a consolidated entity in which we have a 60% interest. the partners' share of the carrying amount has been adjusted for basis differentials.
(6)in connection with the refinancing of the loan, we guaranteed the consolidated entity's obligation to fund various reserves for tenant improvement costs and allowances, leasing commissions and free rent obligations in lieu of cash deposits. as of december 31, 2023, the maximum funding obligation under the guarantee was approximately $8.5 million. we earn a fee from the joint venture for providing the guarantee and have an agreement with our partners to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements).

table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities as of december 31, 2023, we had $2.1 billion of interest rate swaps outstanding, where hedge accounting was elected, with a fair value of approximately $2.0 million. for a description of these interest rate swaps, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements as well as refer to the discussion above under "mortgage notes payable" and "unsecured term loan".
during the year ended december 31, 2023, to satisfy a lender requirement, we entered into two agreements with the same third-party to purchase and sell a $600.0 million interest rate cap. we did not elect hedge accounting and as such any change in market value will be recognized at the end of the period in the consolidated statement of operations. for the year ended december 31, 2023, we recognized approximately $79,000 of loss from entering into these agreements (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).
investment in unconsolidated joint ventures - secured debt we have investments in unconsolidated joint ventures with our effective ownership interests ranging from 20% to approximately 71%. fifteen of these ventures have mortgage indebtedness. we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities. as a result, we account for them using the equity method of accounting. see also note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. at december 31, 2023, the aggregate carrying amount of debt, including both our and our partners' share, incurred by these ventures was approximately $3.4 billion (of which our proportionate share is approximately $1.4 billion). the table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at december 31, 2023. in addition to other guarantees specifically noted in the table, we have agreed to customary environmental indemnifications and nonrecourse carve-outs (e.g., guarantees against fraud, misrepresentation and bankruptcy) as well as the completion of development projects on certain of the loans.

market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. the fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. we manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. we continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy clients in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. as of december 31, 2023, all of our outstanding debt, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures and after taking into account hedging agreements, has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. we also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. this in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. our strategy mitigates against future increases in our interest rates.
table of contents including the effects of interest rate swaps, at december 31, 2023, our weighted-average coupon/stated rate on our fixed rate outstanding consolidated debt was 3.96% per annum. at december 31, 2023, we had approximately $2.1 billion of consolidated variable rate debt outstanding, including $1.2 billion under the 2023 unsecured term loan and $900.0 million of secured debt, all of which were subject to interest rate swaps (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information pertaining to interest rate contracts in place as of december 31, 2023 and their respective fair values). if market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately $21.0 million, on an annualized basis for the year ended december 31, 2023.
the information above does not include our unconsolidated joint venture debt. for a discussion concerning our unconsolidated joint venture debt, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources-investment in unconsolidated joint ventures - secured debt."
funds from operations pursuant to the revised definition of funds from operations adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit"), we calculate funds from operations, or "ffo," for each of bxp and bplp by adjusting net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders (computed in accordance with gaap), respectively, for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, including a change in control, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and our share of real estate-related depreciation and amortization. ffo is a non-gaap financial measure. we believe the presentation of ffo, combined with the presentation of required gaap financial measures, improves the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and helps make comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful. management generally considers ffo to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales or a change in control of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), ffo can help investors compare the operating performance of a company's real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies.
our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently. we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders as presented in our consolidated financial statements. ffo should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders or net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders (determined in accordance with gaap) or any other gaap financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.

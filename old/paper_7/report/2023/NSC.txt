item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data." we have experienced a number of the risks described below over the past year in connection with the incident and the incident proceedings (defined below). the risks described below should be read in conjunction with the information regarding the incident and incident proceedings provided in note 17 in item 8 "notes to consolidated financial statements."
incident risks as defined and as further described in note 17 in item 8 "notes to consolidated financial statements", there was an incident that occurred in the first quarter that consisted of a february 3, 2023 train derailment in east palestine, ohio that included 11 non-company-owned tank cars containing hazardous materials, fires associated with the derailment that threatened certain of the tank cars, and a controlled vent and burn procedure conducted on february 6, 2023 on five of the derailed tank cars, all of which contained vinyl chloride. as a result of the incident, we have become subject to numerous legal, regulatory, legislative and other proceedings related thereto, including but not limited to, the national transportation safety board (ntsb) investigation, the fra incident investigation, the fra safety assessment, the u.s. department of justice (doj) complaint, the ohio complaint, the incident lawsuits, the shareholder matters, and the incident inquiries and investigations, (each as defined in note 17 in item 8 "notes to consolidated financial statements"), in addition to other proceedings, actions, or potential changes in response to the incident, including but not limited to those related to, among other items, train size, train length, train composition, or crew size (collectively, the "incident proceedings"). set forth below are additional risks pertaining to an investment in the company that are related to the incident and the incident proceedings.
the costs, liabilities, fines, penalties, and/or financial impact resulting from or related to the incident or the incident proceedings have been significant to date, may exceed expected or accrued amounts, and have and can be expected to continue to negatively affect our financial results. we have incurred and will continue to remain subject to incurring significant costs, liabilities, fines, and penalties related to the incident and the incident proceedings, including amounts that may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
k11
in addition, while we have accrued estimates of probable and reasonably estimable liabilities with respect to the incident and the incident proceedings (several of which are in early stages), we cannot predict the final outcome or estimate the reasonably possible range of loss with certainty and such estimates may change over time due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to those set forth in note 17 in item 8 "notes to consolidated financial statements" or other unfavorable or unexpected developments or outcomes which could result in our current estimates being insufficient. these estimated amounts also do not include any estimate of loss for specific items for which we believe a loss is either not probable or not reasonably estimable for the reasons set forth in note 17 in item 8 "notes to consolidated financial statements." as a result, our currently accrued amounts of estimated liabilities may be insufficient, and any additional, new or updated accruals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.
new or additional governmental regulation and/or operational changes resulting from or related to the incident or the incident proceedings may negatively impact us, our customers, the rail industry, or the markets we serve. the legislative, regulatory, operational or other actions taken, protocols adopted (including by us), or changes resulting from the incident or any of the incident proceedings may, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on us, our customers, the rail industry, or the markets we serve. we also face risks from requirements that may be imposed by the government in resolution of government actions, including, for example, restrictions on our methods of operations. our inability to comply with the requirements of any new or additional laws, regulations or operating protocols resulting from or related to the incident or the incident proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or operations.
regulatory and legislative risks governmental legislation, regulation, and executive orders over commercial, operational, tax, safety, security, or cybersecurity matters could negatively affect us, our customers, the rail industry or the markets we serve. congress can enact laws, agencies can promulgate regulations, and executive orders can be issued that increase or alter regulation in a way that negatively affects us, our customers, the rail industry or the markets we serve. railroads presently are subject to commercial and operational regulation by the stb, which has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates, routes, customer access provisions, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.
the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers. additional or updated regulation of the rail industry by congress or the stb, whether under new, existing or amended laws or regulations, could have a significant negative impact on our ability to negotiate prices for rail services, on our railway operating revenues, and on the efficiency, conduct, or complexity of our operations. such additional or updated industry regulation, as well as enactment of any new or updated tax laws, could also negatively impact cash flows from our operating activities and, therefore, result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines.
railroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by congress and regulation by the dot (including the fra) and the dhs (including the tsa), which regulate many aspects of our operations related to safety, security and cybersecurity. additional or updated safety, security, or cybersecurity regulation by congress, the dot or dhs could have a negative impact on our business and the efficiency, conduct, or complexity of our operations including (but not limited to) increased operating costs, capital expenditures, claims and litigation.
our inability to comply with the requirements of existing or updated laws, regulations, or executive orders that govern our operations or the rail industry, including but not limited to those pertaining to commercial, operational, tax, safety, security, or cybersecurity matters, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
we are addressing multiple governmental actions as a result of the incident, as noted in "incident risks" above.
k12
federal and state environmental laws and regulations could negatively impact us and our operations. our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things: emissions to the air; discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and, the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases. the risk of incurring environmental liability, for acts and omissions, past, present, and future, is inherent in the railroad business. this risk includes property owned by us, whether currently or in the past, that is or has been subject to a variety of uses, including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants.
environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time, with respect to one or more of these properties. moreover, lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time.
our inability to comply with the extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in significant liabilities or otherwise adversely impact our operations.
as noted in "incident risks" above, in connection with the incident, we are experiencing negative impacts related to environmental matters, including extensive cleanup costs and litigation related to alleged environmental impacts of the incident.
operational risks a significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our business operations. to conduct business, we extensively rely on information and operational technology systems, and improvements in those technologies, in all aspects of our business. the threat landscape is vast and includes hobbyists, cybercriminals, nation-states and state-sponsored activities. attacks from these entities include, but is not limited to, denial of service, unauthorized access, theft of money, and data and extortion. system upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. regardless of the cause, significant disruption or failure of one or more of information or operational technology systems operated by us or under control of third parties, including computer hardware, software, cloud services and communications equipment, can result in us experiencing a service interruption, data breach, or other operational difficulties. such failures or disruptions can adversely impact our business by, among other things, preventing intercompany communications and disrupting operations that may result in direct or indirect monetary losses, damage to equipment or property, or loss of confidence in corporate competency. these events could have a materially adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. although we maintain comprehensive security programs designed to protect our information technology systems, including our risk-based approach to cybersecurity, our reliance on the framework for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity drafted by the u.s department of commerce's national institute of standards and technology (nist csf) and our layered defense system, we are continually targeted by threat actors attempting to access our networks and we may be unable to detect or prevent a breach of our systems or disruption to our service in the future. while we have previously experienced technology outages and cybersecurity events that have impacted our systems and service, future events may result in more significant impacts to our operations, reputation or financial results. these potentially impactful future events could include service disruptions, unauthorized access to our systems, viruses, ransomware, and/or compromise, acquisition, or destruction of our data. we also could be impacted by cybersecurity events targeting third parties that we rely on for business operations, including third party vendors that have access to our systems or data and third parties who provide services and are in our supply chain. such a direct or indirect cybersecurity incident could interrupt our service, cause safety failures or operational difficulties, decrease revenues, increase operating costs, impact our efficiency, damage our corporate reputation, and/or expose us to litigation or government action or increased regulation, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments. in addition, our failure to comply with or adhere to privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in government investigations and proceedings against us, or litigation, resulting in adverse reputational impacts, penalties, and legal liability.
k13
our business may be seriously harmed if we fail to develop, implement, maintain, upgrade, enhance, protect and integrate our information technology systems. if we fail to develop, acquire or implement new technology, or otherwise fail to maintain, protect or integrate our information technology systems, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing alternative modes of transportation service.
as a common carrier by rail, we must offer to transport hazardous materials, which exposes us to significant costs and claims. transportation of certain hazardous materials or third party-owned equipment (typically used to transport such materials) creates risks of significant losses in terms of personal injury and property (including environmental) damage and compromise critical parts of our rail network. the costs of a catastrophic rail accident involving hazardous materials or third party-owned equipment could exceed our insurance coverage. we have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages (see note 17 in item 8 "notes to consolidated financial statements"); however, insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us. any future legislation preventing the transportation of hazardous materials through specific cities could have negative impacts including increased network congestion and operating costs, reduced operating efficiency, and increased risk of an accident involving hazardous materials.
with regard to the risks arising from the transportation of hazardous materials, the incident and the incident proceedings have given rise to significant costs to us and impacts on our rail network, as noted in "incident risks" above. with respect to third party-owned equipment, the primary risk arises from the potential for a latent defect we are unable to identify despite robust safety inspection protocols.
we face competition from other transportation providers. we are subject to competition from motor carriers, railroads and, to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines, on the basis of transit time, pricing, and quality and reliability of service. while we have primarily used internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks and barges have been able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. any future improvements, expenditures, legislation, or regulation changing or materially increasing the efficiency or reducing the cost of one or more alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate (such as granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations or adoption and utilization of autonomous commercial vehicles) could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete with other modes of transportation.
capacity constraints could negatively impact our service and operating efficiency. we have experienced and may again experience capacity constraints on our rail network related to employee or equipment shortages, increased demand for rail services, severe weather, congestion on other railroads, including passenger activities, or impacts from changes to our network structure or composition. such constraints could result in operational inefficiencies or adversely affect our operations.
significant increases in demand for rail services could result in the unavailability of qualified personnel and resources like locomotives. changes in workforce demographics, training requirements, and availability of qualified personnel, particularly for engineers and conductors, have negatively impacted and may again negatively impact our ability to meet short-term demand for rail service. unpredicted increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks and could negatively impact our operational efficiency.
constraints on the supply chain or the operations of carriers with which we interchange may adversely affect our operations.  our ability to provide rail service to our customers depends in large part upon a functioning global supply chain and our ability to maintain collaborative relationships with connecting carriers (including shortlines and regional railroads) with respect to, among other matters, freight rates, revenue division, car supply and locomotive availability, data exchange and communications, reciprocal switching, interchange, and trackage rights. deterioration in the supply chain or service provided by connecting carriers, or in our relationship with those connecting carriers, could result in our inability to meet our customers' demands or require us to use alternate train k14
routes, which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies. additionally, any significant consolidations, mergers or operational changes among other railroads may alter our market access and reach.
we may be negatively affected by terrorism or war. any terrorist attack, or other similar event, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption. because we play a critical role in the nation's transportation system, we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government's preemptive approach or response to an attack or war.
although we currently maintain insurance coverage for third-party liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism, we maintain only limited insurance coverage for first-party property damage and damage to property in our care, custody, or control caused by certain acts of terrorism. in addition, premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically, or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future.
we may be negatively affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets. we consumed approximately 377 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2023. fuel availability could be affected by limitation in the fuel supply or by imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations. a severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments, increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or other factors could impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies.
due to the capital-intensive nature, as well as the industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items, such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment. additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of locomotives and certain track and rolling stock materials. changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited supplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials.
pandemics, epidemics or endemic diseases could further negatively impact us, our customers, our supply chain and our operations. the magnitude and duration of a pandemic, epidemic or endemic disease, and its impact on our customers and general economic conditions can influence the demand for our services and affect our revenues. in addition, such outbreaks could affect our operations and business continuity if a significant number of our essential employees, overall or in a key location, are unable to work from contraction of or exposure to the disease or if governmental orders prevent our employees or critical suppliers from working. to the extent such diseases adversely affect our business and financial results, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors included herein, or may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us.
litigation risks we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, commercial disputes, freight loss and other property damage, and other matters. job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employer's liability act (fela), which is applicable only to railroads. fela's fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker's compensation system. the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded.
a catastrophic rail accident, whether on our lines or another carrier's, involving any or all of release of hazardous materials, freight loss, property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could compromise critical parts of our rail network. losses associated with such an accident involving us could exceed our insurance coverage, resulting in a material adverse effect on our liquidity. any material changes to current litigation trends could also have a material adverse effect on our liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance.
k15
we have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages; however, insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us.
we are incurring significant expenditures as a result of claims and lawsuits arising from the incident and the related incident proceedings, as described in "incident risks" above.
human capital risks failure to attract and retain key executive officers, or skilled professional or technical employees could adversely impact our business and operations.  our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees, including a sufficient number of craft employees to enable us to efficiently conduct our operations. difficulties in recruiting and retaining skilled employees, including train and engine workers, key executives, and other skilled professional and technical employees; the unexpected loss of such individuals; and/or our inability to successfully transition key roles could each have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.
the vast majority of our employees belong to labor unions, and the renegotiation of labor agreements or any provisions thereof, or any strikes or work stoppages (including any entered into in connection with any such negotiations), could adversely affect our operations. approximately 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. we entered into updated labor agreements with these labor unions in december 2022 and future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could significantly increase our costs for health care, wages, and other benefits. additionally, if our craft employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, including in connection with the renegotiation of any such agreements or any provisions thereof, we could experience a significant disruption in our operations, thereby adversely impacting our results of operations.
climate change risks severe weather and disasters have caused, and could again cause, significant business interruptions and expenditures. severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena resulting from changing weather patterns and rising sea levels or other causes, including hurricanes, floods, fires, landslides, extreme temperatures, significant precipitation, and earthquakes, have caused, and may again cause damage to our network, our workforce to be unavailable and us to be unable to use our equipment. additionally, shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency, severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions, which could cause more significant business interruptions that result in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues.
concern over climate change has led to significant federal, state, and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions. restrictions, caps, taxes, or other legislative or regulatory controls on ghg emissions, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs and decrease the amount of traffic we handle.
in addition, legislation and regulation related to climate change or ghg emissions could negatively affect the markets we serve and our customers. even without legislation or regulation, government incentives and adverse publicity relating to climate change or ghg emissions could negatively affect the markets for certain of the commodities we carry, or our customers that use commodities we carry to produce energy (including coal), use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy associated with ghg emissions.
k16
macroeconomic and market risks we may be negatively impacted by changes in general economic conditions. negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions, including reduced import and export volumes, could affect the producers and consumers of the freight we carry. economic conditions could also result in bankruptcies of one or more large customers.
we may be negatively affected by energy prices. volatility in energy prices could have a significant effect on a variety of items including, but not limited to: the economy; demand for transportation services; business related to the energy sector, including crude oil, natural gas, and coal; fuel prices; and, fuel surcharges.
the state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity. we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements, including the issuance of debt instruments and the sale of certain receivables. significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration of our financial position due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to, and/or significantly increase the cost of, various financing sources, including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds. instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial position, alone or in combination, could also result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade, which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short- and long-term debt financing and/or significantly increase the associated costs.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes. refer to item 8 "notes to consolidated financial statements" for all "note" references.
overview we are one of the nation's premier transportation companies, moving goods and materials that help drive the u.s. economy. we connect customers to markets and communities to economic opportunity with safe, reliable, and cost-effective shipping solutions. our norfolk southern railway company subsidiary operates in 22 states and the district of columbia. we are a major transporter of industrial products, including agriculture, forest and consumer products, chemicals, and metals and construction materials. in addition, in the east we serve every major container port and operate the most extensive intermodal network. we are also a principal carrier of coal, automobiles, and automotive parts.
our 2023 financial results were impacted by a february 2023 derailment in eastern ohio. the derailment of 38 railcars resulted in the release of certain chemicals that were being transported for our customers. following the incident (as defined and as further described in note 17) and throughout the remainder of the year, we have worked to clean the derailment site safely and thoroughly and to monitor for any impact on public health and the environment. as a result of the incident, we incurred $1.1 billion of expenses primarily related to our environmental cleanup and remediation efforts at and around the site, related legal proceedings, and other incident-related costs. as a result, income from railway operations, net income, and diluted earnings per share declined compared to 2022, most significantly as a result of the direct costs from the incident. our financial results were further impacted by lower revenues and higher non-incident-related operating expenses.

income from railway operations, net income and diluted earnings per share declined in 2023 compared to 2022, driven by expenses incurred with our response efforts to the incident (note 17), lower railway operating revenues, and higher non-incident-related railway operating expenses. railway operating revenues declined 5% due to lower average revenue per unit, the result of lower fuel surcharge revenue and decreased intermodal storage service revenues partially offset by favorable pricing and mix. additionally, lower volumes contributed to the decline in revenues. expenses associated with the incident for the year were $1.1 billion. in addition to costs resulting from the incident, railway operating expenses increased due to inflationary pressures, investments in operational resiliency, and higher service-related costs, offset partially by lower fuel prices. the decline in net income and diluted earnings per share also reflects the absence of a prior year $136 million deferred tax benefit, a result of an enactment of a change in the corporate income tax rate in the commonwealth of pennsylvania in 2022. railway operating ratio (a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses) deteriorated to 76.5 percent.
k23
income from railway operations increased in 2022 compared to 2021, driven by higher railway operating revenues. revenue growth was the result of higher fuel surcharge revenues and pricing gains, which more than offset the impact of volume declines. the rise in revenues was partly offset by increased railway operating expenses, driven by higher fuel prices, other inflationary pressures, service-related costs, increased labor-related costs primarily resulting from labor union negotiations, and higher claims-related expenses. incremental expenses incurred in 2022 that resulted from finalized labor agreements for wages earned in 2021 and prior periods lowered diluted earnings per share by $0.18. additionally, net income included a $136 million deferred tax benefit resulting from a state corporate income tax rate change, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.58. our share repurchase activity resulted in the percentage increase in diluted earnings per share that exceeded that of net income. railway operating ratio deteriorated to 62.3 percent.
the following table adjusts our 2023 u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) financial results to exclude the effects of the incident. the income tax effects of this non-gaap adjustment were calculated based on the applicable tax rates to which the non-gaap adjustment related. we use these non-gaap financial measures internally and believe this information provides useful supplemental information to investors to facilitate making period-to-period comparisons by excluding the 2023 costs arising from the incident. while we believe that these non-gaap financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, these non-gaap financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.

on a non-gaap basis excluding the impact of direct costs resulting from the incident, income from railway operations decreased in 2023 due to lower railway operating revenues and higher railway operating expenses. railway operating revenues declined due to decreased fuel surcharge revenue, decreased intermodal storage revenues, and lower volume, partially offset by increased pricing and favorable mix compared to the prior year. railway operating expenses increased due to inflationary pressures, investments in operational resiliency, and higher service-related costs, partially offset by lower fuel prices.

approximately 95% of our revenue base is covered by contracts that include negotiated fuel surcharges. fuel surcharge revenues totaled $1.2 billion, $1.6 billion, and $622 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. the change in fuel surcharge revenues in each period was primarily driven by fluctuations in fuel commodity prices.
for 2024, we expect that revenue will increase modestly driven by higher volumes.
merchandise revenues increased in both 2023 and 2022 compared with the prior years. in 2023, revenues were slightly higher as pricing and volume gains were nearly offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue and unfavorable mix. increased volumes in automotive and agriculture, forest and consumer shipments were partially offset by decreased chemicals shipments. in 2022, revenues rose due to higher average revenue per unit, driven by higher fuel surcharge revenue and increased pricing, partially offset by lower volume. decreased volumes in metal and construction and automotive shipments more than offset higher chemical shipments.
agriculture, forest and consumer products revenues increased in both 2023 and 2022 compared with the prior years. in 2023, the rise was the result of increased volume. average revenue per unit was flat, the result of lower fuel surcharge revenue offset by pricing gains. increases in ethanol and fertilizer shipments more than offset declines in shipments of wood chips and graphic paper. increased market demand led to volume gains in ethanol and fertilizer. volume declines in wood chips were due to customer mill closures, while lower market demand led to the decline in graphic paper. in 2022, the rise was the result of increased average revenue per unit, the result of higher fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains, while volumes were nearly flat. declines in pulpboard, fertilizer, and pulp, were offset by increases in soybeans, feed, and corn. pulpboard and pulp shipments declined due to decreased demand, equipment availability, service disruptions, and production down time. lower fertilizer shipments were driven by high fertilizer prices causing customers to draw down on existing inventories or delay purchases as well as production disruptions. soybean volumes were higher due to increased opportunity for exports. feed shipments were higher due to increased customer demand. increased corn shipments were due to improved equipment cycle times.
chemicals revenues decreased in 2023 but increased in 2022 compared with the prior years. in 2023, the decrease was as a result of volume declines. reduced shipments of crude oil, organic chemicals, and natural gas liquids, more than offset the increases in solid waste and other petroleum products. volume declines for crude oil were driven by soft demand in the energy markets. organic chemicals and natural gas liquids volume declined as a result k27
of lower demand. volume gains in solid waste were due to growth with existing customers, while the gains in petroleum products were due to growth with existing customers and new business opportunities. in 2022, the increase was the result of higher average revenue per unit, driven by fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains, and volume growth. increases in sand and solid waste shipments were partially offset by declines in plastics, inorganic chemicals, organic chemicals, and natural gas liquids. the increase in sand was due to greater demand resulting from sustained high natural gas prices. solid waste shipments increased due to growth with existing customers. plastics shipments decreased due to softening of the housing market. declines in inorganic chemicals, organic chemicals, and natural gas liquids shipments were due to decreased demand and reduced production.
metals and construction revenues were lower in 2023 but higher in 2022 compared with the prior years. in 2023, the decline in revenue was driven by lower average revenue per unit, the result of decreased fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by increased price. volumes were nearly unchanged as reduced shipments of kaolin and construction materials were offset by volume gains in coil steel and scrap metal. the volume declines in kaolin were largely driven by lower demand, while the declines in construction materials were due to lower demand, extended cycle times and service challenges. gains in coil steel volume were due to increased equipment available to handle demand, while scrap metal volume increased due to higher demand. in 2022, revenue growth was driven by higher average revenue per unit, the result of higher fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains, partially offset by lower volume. volumes fell largely as a result of decreased shipments of coil steel, iron and steel, and scrap metal driven by service disruptions and slower equipment cycle times.
automotive revenues rose in both 2023 and 2022 compared with the prior years. the increase in revenues in 2023 was driven by increased volume and higher average revenue per unit, driven by favorable price. volume increases were due to higher finished vehicle inventory levels available for rail transportation and improved equipment cycle times. the increase in revenues in 2022 was driven by higher average revenue per unit, due to higher fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains, partially offset by volume declines. volume declines were the result of slower equipment cycle times partially offset by fewer parts supply issues due to easing supply chain congestion when compared to the prior year.
intermodal revenues decreased in 2023 but increased in 2022 compared with the prior years. the decrease in 2023 was the result of lower average revenue per unit, driven by reduced storage service charges and lower fuel surcharge revenue, and decreased volume. the increase in 2022 was the result of higher average revenue per unit, due to higher fuel surcharge revenue, pricing gains, and increased storage service charges, partially offset by decreased volume.
intermodal units by market were as follows:

domestic volume decreased in both 2023 and 2022 compared with the prior years. in 2023, volume declined due to a decrease in freight demand as a result of reduced consumer consumption combined with high inventories, and increased truck competition. in 2022, volume declined due to service disruptions, terminal congestion, strong over-the-road competition, and increased truck availability.
international volume increased in 2023 but decreased in 2022. the increase in 2023 was driven by ocean carriers favoring inland point intermodal traffic, partially offset by a decrease in imports. the decline in 2022 was the result of supply chain constraints, chassis shortages, and excess retail inventory.

coal revenues decreased in 2023 but increased in 2022 compared with the prior years. the decrease in 2023 was a result of decreased volumes. average revenue per unit was flat as lower fuel surcharge revenue and pricing declines were offset by positive mix. the increase in 2022 was due to higher average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue, and increased volumes.
as shown in the following table, total tonnage decreased in 2023 but increased 2022.

utility coal tonnage decreased in 2023 but increased in 2022 compared with the prior years. the decrease in 2023 was due to low natural gas prices, high stockpiles, and unplanned customer outages. the increase in 2022 was due to increased demand and service improvements.
export coal tonnage increased in both periods compared with prior years. the increases in both years were a result of increased demand and coal supply.
domestic metallurgical coal tonnage decreased in both 2023 and 2022 compared with the prior years. the decrease in 2023 was due to reduced coke shipments resulting from idled customer facilities. the decrease in 2022 was the result of reduced coke shipments related to customer sourcing changes and idled customer facilities.

in 2023, expenses increased as we incurred $1.1 billion of costs related to environmental matters and legal proceedings resulting from the incident (note 17). additionally, railway operating expenses reflected higher costs due to inflationary pressures, investments in operational resiliency, and higher service-related costs. partially offsetting these increases were the impacts of lower fuel prices and the absence of retroactive wage increases recorded in 2022. in 2022, expenses increased primarily as a result of higher fuel prices, other inflationary pressures, service-related costs, increased labor-related costs resulting from labor union negotiations, and higher claims expense.
compensation and benefits increased in 2023, reflecting changes in:
•employee activity levels (up $138 million),
•pay rates (up $86 million),
•overtime (up $9 million),
•incentive and stock-based compensation (down $30 million), and
•other (down $5 million).
in 2022, compensation and benefits increased, a result of changes in:
•pay rates (up $188 million),
•employee activity levels (up $51 million),
•overtime (up $18 million),
•incentive and stock-based compensation (down $79 million), and
•other (up $1 million).
pay rates in 2022 were impacted by the outcome of completed labor negotiations, which resulted in retroactive wage increases and other benefits pertaining to prior years. these wage increases and benefits increased compensation and benefits by $54 million.
our employment averaged 20,300 in 2023, compared with 18,900 in 2022, and 18,500 in 2021.

the increase in purchased services in 2023 was due to higher technology-related costs, increased operational and transportation expenses, and higher engineering activity. the increase in purchased services in 2022 was due to inflationary pressures which resulted in higher intermodal-related expenses, and increased operational and transportation expenses, as well as higher technology-related costs.
equipment rents, which includes our cost of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment, increased in both periods. in 2023, the increase was due to increased intermodal equipment expenses, higher freight car lease costs, and decreased equity in ttx company's (ttx) earnings. in 2022, the increase was the result of lower network fluidity which led to greater time-and-mileage expenses, increased automotive and intermodal equipment expenses, and higher short-term locomotive resource costs.
fuel expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations, decreased in 2023 but increased in 2022. the decrease in 2023 was due to lower locomotive fuel prices (down 20%), which decreased fuel expense by $275 million. the increase in 2022 was due to higher locomotive fuel prices (up 87%) which increased expenses by $634 million. locomotive fuel consumption was nearly flat in 2023 and decreased 2% in 2022. we consumed 377 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2023, compared with 376 million gallons in 2022 and 384 million gallons in 2021.
depreciation expense increased in both periods. in both periods, the increase was a reflection of reinvestment in our infrastructure, rolling stock, and technology. the increase in 2023 also reflects the impact of changes in group depreciable lives as a result of our periodic roadway study.

claims expense includes costs related to personal injury, property damage, and environmental matters. the decrease in 2023 was primarily the result of lower personal injury case development, lower costs related to environmental remediation matters unrelated to the incident, and a claims-related recovery. the increase in 2022 was primarily the result of higher costs associated with unfavorable personal injury case development, increased environmental remediation expenses, and higher lading and property damage costs.
other expense increased in 2023 primarily due to lower gains from operating property sales and increased travel-related expenses. in 2022, other expense increased primarily due to higher travel-related expenses, increased non-income-based taxes, and lower gains from sales of operating property, partially offset by lower relocation expenses. gains from operating property sales amounted to $43 million, $76 million, and $82 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
eastern ohio incident during 2023, we recorded $1.1 billion for costs primarily associated with environmental matters and legal proceedings. we recorded $101 million of recoveries from claims made under our insurance policies, which are included in the total amount recorded in 2023. for further details regarding the incident, see note 17 in item 8 "notes to consolidated financial statements."
other income - net other income - net increased in 2023 but decreased in 2022. the increase in 2023 was the result of higher net returns on corporate-owned life insurance (coli) and increased interest income, partially offset by lower gains from non-operating property sales. the decrease in 2022 was driven by lower net returns on coli partially offset by a higher net pension benefit and increased interest income.
income taxes the effective income tax rate was 21.3% in 2023, compared with 20.8% in 2022 and 22.5% in 2021.  the current year benefited from tax credits and higher coli returns offset by reduced benefits from stock-based compensation. the effective income tax rate in 2022 and 2021 reflects favorable benefits associated with stock-based compensation and various state law changes (note 4), while 2021 also benefited from higher coli returns.
for 2024, we expect an effective income tax rate between 23% and 24%.
financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources cash provided by operating activities, our principal source of liquidity, was $3.2 billion in 2023, $4.2 billion in 2022, and $4.3 billion in 2021. the decrease in 2023 reflects lower operating results, offset in part by changes in working capital. the decrease in 2022 reflected changes in working capital, offset in part by improved operating results. we had working capital of $639 million at december 31, 2023 and negative working capital of $642 million at december 31, 2022. cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.6 billion and $456 million at december 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. we expect that cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations. in addition, we believe our currently-available borrowing capacity, access to additional financing, ability to reduce shareholder distributions, including share repurchases, and ability to moderate or defer property additions provide additional flexibility to meet our ongoing obligations in the short- and long-term.

off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of unrecognized obligations, including future interest payments on fixed-rate long-term debt, the pending purchase of the assets of csr, and unconditional purchase obligations which are included in the table above.
cash used in investing activities was $2.2 billion in 2023, $1.6 billion in 2022, and $1.2 billion in 2021.  the increase in 2023 was primarily driven by higher property additions and lower proceeds from property sales. in 2022, the increase is due to higher property additions partially offset by increased proceeds from property sales.
capital spending and track and equipment statistics can be found within the "railway property" section of part i of this report on form 10-k. for 2024, we expect property additions, excluding the purchase of the csr, to approximate $2.3 billion.
in november 2022, we entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement with the board of trustees of the csr, which was amended and restated in june 2023, to purchase approximately 337 miles of railway line that extends from cincinnati, ohio to chattanooga, tennessee. we currently operate this railway line under a lease agreement. following the june 2023 amendment, the total purchase price for the line and other associated real and personal property included in the transaction is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion. the agreement was conditioned upon the following, among other items: (i) cincinnati voter approval, which was obtained in november 2023, and (ii) the receipt of regulatory approval from the stb, which occurred in september 2023. the transaction is scheduled to close on march 15, 2024.
cash provided by financing activities was $115 million in 2023, while cash used in financing activities was $3.0 billion in 2022 and $3.3 billion in 2021. the increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2023 reflects lower repurchases of common stock and increased proceeds from borrowings, partially offset by higher debt repayments. in 2022, the decrease in cash used in financing activities reflects lower repurchases of common stock and increased proceeds from borrowings, partially offset by higher dividends.
k33
share repurchases of $622 million in 2023, $3.1 billion in 2022, and $3.4 billion in 2021 resulted in the retirement of 2.8 million, 12.6 million, and 12.7 million shares, respectively. as of december 31, 2023, $6.9 billion remains authorized by our board of directors for repurchase. the timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors. repurchases may be executed in the open market, through derivatives, accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with rule 10b5-1(c) and rule 10b-18 under the securities and exchange act of 1934. any near-term purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally-generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings.
in november 2023, we issued $400 million of 5.55% senior notes due 2034 and $600 million of 5.95% senior notes due 2064.
in august 2023, we issued $600 million of 5.05% senior notes due 2030 and $1.0 billion of 5.35% senior notes due 2054.
in february 2023, we issued $500 million of 4.45% senior notes due 2033.
in may 2023, we renewed our accounts receivable securitization program with a maximum borrowing capacity of $400 million. amounts under our accounts receivable securitization program are borrowed and repaid from time to time in the ordinary course for general corporate and cash management purposes. the term of our accounts receivable securitization program expires in may 2024. we had no amounts outstanding under this program at december 31, 2023 and $100 million outstanding at december 31, 2022. our available borrowing capacity was $400 million at december 31, 2023 and $300 million at december 31, 2022.
in january 2024, we renewed and amended our $800 million credit agreement. the amended agreement expires in january 2029, and provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants. we had no amounts outstanding under this facility at either december 31, 2023 or december 31, 2022, and we are in compliance with all of its covenants.
in january 2024, we also entered into a term loan credit agreement that established a 364-day, $1.0 billion, unsecured delayed draw term loan facility under which we can borrow for general corporate purposes. the term loan credit agreement provides for borrowing at prevailing rates and includes covenants that align with the $800 million credit agreement.
in addition, we have investments in general purpose coli policies and had the ability to borrow against these policies up to $640 million and $610 million at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively.
our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 57.3% at december 31, 2023, compared with 54.4% at december 31, 2022. we discuss our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program in note 9. upcoming annual debt maturities are also disclosed in note 9.  overall, our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  these estimates and assumptions may require judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions.  accordingly, we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.

incident contingencies we are currently involved in certain environmental response and remediation activities and subject to numerous legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and investigations relating to the incident. we have accrued estimates of the probable and reasonably estimable costs for the resolution of these matters. our environmental estimates are based upon types of remediation efforts currently anticipated, the volume of contaminants in the impacted areas, and governmental oversight and other costs, amongst other factors. estimates associated with the legal proceedings to which we are subject are based on information that is currently available, including but not limited to an assessment of the proceedings and the potential and likely results of such proceedings.
our current estimates of future environmental cleanup and remediation liabilities related to the incident may change over time due to various factors, including but not limited to, the nature and extent of required future cleanup and removal activities (including those resulting from soil, water, sediment, and air assessment and investigative activities that are and will continue to be conducted at the site), and the extent and duration of governmental oversight, amongst other factors. additionally, the final outcome of any of the legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, and developments related to the progress of such legal proceedings, inquiries, or investigations or other unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional costs or new or additionally accrued amounts that could be material to our results of operations in any particular year. furthermore, certain costs may be recoverable under our insurance policies in effect at the date of the incident or from third parties. any amounts that are recoverable under our insurance policies or from third parties will be reflected in the period in which recovery is considered probable.
see note 17 for more detailed information as it pertains to these contingencies.
pensions and other postretirement benefits accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions (note 12).  these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans' assets and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality.  in addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value.  we make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information we deem pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance).  we utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm's studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities.
for 2023, we assumed a long-term investment rate of return of 8.0%, which was supported by our long-term total rate of return on pension plan assets since inception, as well as our expectation of future returns. a one-percentage point decrease to this rate of return assumption would result in a $25 million increase in annual pension expense. we review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually, and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings, and mortality, they are not expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future. the net pension liability is recorded at net present value using discount rates that are based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments.  we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds.  we use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans. a one-percentage point decrease to this discount rate assumption would result in a $15 million increase in annual pension expense.
properties and depreciation most of our assets are long-lived railway properties (note 7). "properties" are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using the group method whereby assets with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped k35
together in asset classes and depreciated using a composite depreciation rate. see note 1 for a more detailed discussion of assumptions and estimates.
expenditures, including those on leased assets, that extend an asset's useful life or increase its utility are capitalized. expenditures capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include materials, labor, and other direct costs, in addition to an allocable portion of indirect costs that relate to a capital project. a significant portion of our annual capital spending relates to self-constructed assets. costs related to repairs and maintenance activities that, in our judgment, do not extend an asset's useful life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed.
depreciation expense for 2023 totaled $1.3 billion.  our composite depreciation rates for 2023 are disclosed in note 7; a one-year increase (or decrease) in the estimated average useful lives of depreciable assets would have resulted in an approximate $47 million decrease (or increase) to annual depreciation expense.
personal injury claims expense, included in "materials and other" in the consolidated statements of income, includes our estimate of costs for personal injuries.
to aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year, we utilize studies prepared by an independent actuarial consulting firm. the actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences. we adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study. the accuracy of our estimate of the liability is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and, as such, the ultimate loss sustained may vary from the estimated liability recorded.
see note 17 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates we use for personal injury.
income taxes our net deferred tax liability totaled $7.2 billion at december 31, 2023 (note 4).  this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements.  after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns.  for state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. we have a $31 million valuation allowance on $570 million of deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2023, reflecting the expectation that substantially all of these assets will be realized.
other matters labor agreements approximately 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. pursuant to the railway labor act, these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached, or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the railway labor act are completed. moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements. we largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads, represented by the national carriers' conference committee.
the latest round of national bargaining concluded in december 2022, when agreements were either ratified or enacted through legislative action for all twelve of our unions. with the conclusion of national bargaining, neither party can compel mandatory bargaining around any new proposals until november 1, 2024.
k36
in addition, we understand the imperative to continue improving quality of life for our craft employees and remain actively engaged with our unions in voluntary local discussions (none of which carry the risk of a work stoppage) on this important issue.
market risks we manage overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating- rate debt instruments. at december 31, 2023, we have no outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations. market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a one-percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31, 2023 and amounts to an increase of approximately $1.7 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31, 2023. we consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
new accounting pronouncements for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see note 1.
inflation in preparing financial statements, gaap requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property.  as a capital-intensive company, we have most of our capital invested in long-lived assets.  the replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.
forward-looking statements certain statements in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, as amended.  these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or our achievements or those of our industry to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.  in some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as "may," "will," "could," "would," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "project," "consider," "predict," "potential," "feel," or other comparable terminology.  we have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates, beliefs, and projections.  while we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates, beliefs, and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control.  these and other important factors, including those discussed in item 1a "risk factors," may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  the forward-looking statements herein are made only as of the date they were first issued, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to provide information to the reader in understanding our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements between select periods, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. in addition, we discuss certain accounting principles, policies, and critical estimates that affect our financial statements. our discussion also contains some additional context regarding our business, including industry considerations and the business environment, as well as certain forward-looking statements related to future events and expectations. this md&a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this form 10-k, including item 1a. "risk factors."
business overview we are a global premier systems provider of high technology products and services to the aerospace and defense industries. effective july 17, 2023, we changed our legal name from raytheon technologies corporation to rtx corporation. effective july 1, 2023, we streamlined the structure of our core businesses to three principal business segments: collins aerospace (collins), pratt & whitney, and raytheon. all segment information included in this form 10-k is reflective of this new structure and prior period information has been recast to conform to our current period presentation. unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "our," "us," "the company," and "rtx" mean rtx corporation and its subsidiaries.
industry considerations our worldwide operations can be affected by industrial, economic, and political factors on both a regional and global level. our operations include original equipment manufacturer (oem) and extensive related aftermarket parts and services related to our aerospace operations. our defense business serves both domestic and international customers primarily as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for government customers. our business mix also reflects the combination of shorter cycles in our commercial aerospace spares contracts and certain service contracts in our defense business, and longer cycles in our aerospace oem and aftermarket maintenance contracts and on our defense contracts to design, develop, manufacture, or modify complex equipment. our customers are in the public and private sectors, and our businesses reflect an extensive geographic diversification that has evolved with continued globalization.
government legislation, policies, and regulations can impact our business and operations. changes in environmental and climate change-related laws or regulations, including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing, and energy taxes, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and facility upgrades and could increase our operational and environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs and costs associated with manufacturing changes. in addition, government and industry-driven safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions, government imposed travel restrictions, and government procurement practices can impact our businesses. collins and pratt & whitney serve both commercial and government aerospace customers. revenue passenger miles (rpms), available seat miles, and the general economic health of airline carriers are key barometers for our commercial aerospace operations. performance in the general aviation sector is closely tied to the overall health of the economy and is positively correlated to corporate profits. many of our aerospace customers are covered under long-term aftermarket service agreements at both collins and pratt & whitney, which are inclusive of both spare parts and services.
our defense operations are affected by u.s. department of defense (dod) budget and spending levels, changes in demand, changes in policy positions or priorities, the domestic and global political and economic environment, and the evolving nature of the global and national security threat environment. in addition, our defense businesses engage in both direct commercial sales, which generally require u.s. government licenses and approvals, as well as foreign military sales, which are government-to-government transactions initiated by, and carried out at the direction of, the u.s. government. changes in these budget and spending levels, policies, or priorities, which are subject to u.s. domestic and foreign geopolitical risks and threats, may impact our defense businesses, including the timing of and delays in u.s. government licenses and approvals for sales, the risk of sanctions, or other restrictions.
other matters global economic and political conditions, changes in raw material and commodity prices and supply, labor availability and costs, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical conflicts and strained intercountry relations, u.s. and non u.s. tax law changes, foreign currency exchange rates, energy costs and supply, levels of air travel, the financial condition of commercial airlines, and the impact from natural disasters and weather conditions create uncertainties that could impact our businesses.
pratt & whitney powder metal matter. as described further in "note 17: commitments and contingencies" within item 8 of this form 10-k, pratt & whitney has determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the pw1100g-jm (pw1100) geared turbofan (gtf) fleet, which powers the a320neo table of contents family of aircraft (a320neo) (herein referred to as the "powder metal matter").
global supply chain. we are dependent on a global supply chain and in recent years have experienced supply chain disruptions that resulted in delays and increased costs and adversely affected our performance. these disruptions impacted our ability to procure raw materials, microelectronics, and certain commodities on a timely basis and/or at expected prices, and are driven by supply chain market constraints and macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and labor market shortages. current geopolitical conditions, including conflicts and other causes of strained intercountry relations, as well as sanctions and other trade restrictive activities, are contributing to these issues. furthermore, our suppliers and subcontractors have been impacted by these same issues. we have implemented actions and programs to mitigate some of the impacts but anticipate supply chain disruptions to continue into 2024.
economic environment. current high inflation levels have increased material and component prices, labor rates, and supplier costs and have negatively impacted our operating profit and margin, including impact on productivity expectations. due to the nature of our government and commercial aerospace businesses, and their respective customer and supplier contracts, we are not always able to offset cost increases by increasing our contract value or pricing, in particular on our fixed-price contracts. increasing material, component, and labor prices could subject us to losses in our fixed price contracts in the event of cost overruns. in addition, higher interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing and tightened the availability of capital. among other things, these effects can constrain our customers' purchasing power and decrease orders for our products and services and impact the ability of our customers to make payments and our suppliers to perform. moreover, volatility in interest rates and financial markets can lead to economic uncertainty, an economic downturn or recession and impact the demand for our products and services as well as our supply chain. we continue to pursue strategic and operational initiatives to help address these macroeconomic pressures, including our digital transformation, operational modernization, cost reduction, and advanced technology programs, and we apply our customer oriented results excellence (core) operating platform to the execution of these initiatives. however, the impact of these pressures and corresponding initiatives is uncertain and subject to a range of factors and future developments.
u.s. government's budget. since the end of its fiscal year 2023, the u.s. government has been operating under a series of continuing resolutions to keep the government funded while congress works to enact full year fiscal year 2024 (fy24) appropriation bills. on january 7, 2024, congressional leaders announced an overall funding agreement enabling congress to complete action on the fy24 appropriations bills. the current continuing resolution, signed on january 19, 2024, funds certain agencies through march 1 and others through march 8. under a continuing resolution, federal agencies continue to operate generally at the same funding levels as the prior year, but typically new spending initiatives cannot be executed during this period. while we expect congress to complete the full year fy24 appropriations bills before the current continuing resolution expires and for the fy24 defense appropriations bill to provide increased spending consistent with the overall funding agreement, if congress is unable to complete the fy24 appropriation bills (or pass another continuing resolution), then the u.s. government would shut down during which federal agencies would cease all non-essential functions.
geopolitical matters. in response to russia's invasion of ukraine, the u.s. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, have imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in russia. the russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in the u.s. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, including certain members of the company's management team and board of directors. these government measures, among other limitations, restrict transactions involving various russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software, and technologies to and from russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. these measures have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers; however, based on information available to date, we do not currently expect these issues will have a material adverse effect on our financial results. we will continue to monitor future developments, including additional sanctions and other measures, that could adversely affect the company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers.
in february 2023, china announced sanctions against raytheon missiles & defense (rmd) (a former rtx corporation (rtx) business segment which became part of raytheon as a result of the july 1, 2023 rtx segment realignment), and previously announced it may take measures against rtx, in connection with certain foreign military sales to taiwan. the chinese sanctions against rmd included a fine equal to twice the value of the arms that rmd sold to taiwan since september 2020. in addition, in september 2022, china indicated that it decided to sanction our chairman and chief executive officer, gregory hayes, in connection with another foreign military sale to taiwan involving rtx products and services. if china were to impose additional sanctions, enforce announced sanctions, or take other regulatory action against rtx, our suppliers, affiliates, or partners, it could potentially disrupt our business operations. any impact of these or other potential sanctions or other actions by china is uncertain.
table of contents we have direct commercial sales contracts for products and services to certain foreign customers, for which u.s. government review and approval have been pending. the u.s. government's approval of these sales is subject to a range of factors, including its foreign policies related to these customers, which are subject to continuing review and potential changes. likewise, regulatory approvals previously granted for prior sales can be paused or revoked if the products and services have not yet been delivered to the customer. in addition, certain programs require approvals by foreign governments, and those approvals may not be obtained on a timely basis or at all or may be revoked. if we ultimately do not receive all of the regulatory approvals, or those approvals are revoked, it could have a material effect on our financial results. in particular, as of december 31, 2023, our contract liabilities include approximately $405 million of advance payments received from a middle east customer on contracts for which we no longer believe we will be able to execute on or obtain required regulatory approvals. these advance payments may become refundable to the customer if the contracts are ultimately terminated.
we continue to closely monitor developments in the war between israel and hamas that began on october 7, 2023, including potential impacts to rtx's business, customers, suppliers, employees, and operations in israel, the middle east, and elsewhere. at this time, impacts to rtx are minimal. rtx's commercial manufacturing facilities in israel remain open and operational and have continued exporting products and importing critical items and raw materials. the war has also not impacted our defense programs' ability to receive components from israel. for some products, there could be future delivery delays because of the ongoing war. the potential impacts to rtx are subject to change given the volatile nature of the situation.
see item 1a. "risk factors" within part i of this form 10-k for further discussion.
financial summary we use the following key financial performance measures to manage our business on a consolidated basis and by business segment, and to monitor and assess our results of operations:
•net sales: a growth metric that measures our revenue for the current year;
•operating profit: a measure of our profit for the year, before non-operating expenses, net and income taxes;
•operating profit margin: a measure of our operating profit as a percentage of total net sales; and
•operating cash flow from continuing operations: a measure of the amount of cash generated by our business operations.

total net sales                                         $68,920                  $67,074                  $64,388

operating profit margins                                    5.2   %                  8.2   %                  8.0   %
operating cash flow from continuing operations           $7,883                   $7,168                   $7,142
in order to better assess the underlying performance of our business, we also focus on the change in organic net sales on both a consolidated basis and business segment basis, and the change in organic operating profit on a business segment basis, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. see results of operations below for our definition of the organic change in net sales and operating profit, which are not defined measures under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and may be calculated differently by other companies.
we also focus on backlog as a key financial performance measure of our forward-looking sales growth. total backlog was $196 billion and $175 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations (rpo) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (idiq) type contracts). backlog generally increases with bookings and/or orders and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations, and cost underruns on cost-type contracts.
in addition, we maintain a strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments in order to maximize operating income and cash. we focus on adjusted earnings per share (eps) and measures to assess our cash generation and the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital, such as free cash flow, both of which are not defined measures under u.s. gaap and may be calculated differently by other companies.
considered together, we believe these metrics are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareowner value. we also use these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes.
a discussion of our results of operations and financial condition follows below in results of operations, segment review, and liquidity and financial condition.
table of contents results of operations as described in our "cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results" of this form 10-k, our period-to-period comparisons of our results, particularly at a segment level, may not be indicative of our future operating results. the following discussions of comparative results among periods, including the discussion of segment results, should be viewed in this context.
we provide the organic change in net sales and cost of sales for our consolidated results of operations as well as the organic change in net sales and operating profit for our segments. we believe that these non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-gaap) measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. the organic change in net sales, cost of sales, and operating profit excludes acquisitions and divestitures, net, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate translation fluctuations, and other significant non-operational items and/or significant operational items that may occur at irregular intervals (other). additionally, the organic change in cost of sales and operating profit excludes restructuring costs, the fas/cas operating adjustment, and costs related to certain acquisition accounting adjustments. restructuring costs generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions and facility exit costs. we are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive. the fas/cas operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (prb) expense under the financial accounting standards (fas) requirements of u.s. gaap and our pension and prb expense under u.s. government cost accounting standards (cas), primarily related to our raytheon segment. acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment, if applicable.

(1)    see "results of operations" for definition of organic. a reconciliation of this measure to reported u.s. gaap amounts is provided in the table above.
net sales increased $7.3 billion organically in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to higher organic sales of $3.2 billion at collins, $3.1 billion at pratt & whitney, and $1.3 billion at raytheon. the $0.1 billion decrease in net sales related to acquisitions and divestitures, net in 2023 compared to 2022, was primarily driven by the divestiture of a small non-core naval power business in the fourth quarter of 2022. the decrease in other net sales of $5.4 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, was primarily driven by the net sales charge of $5.4 billion associated with the powder metal matter recognized in the third quarter of 2023.
net sales increased $3.7 billion organically in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher organic sales of $2.5 billion at pratt & whitney and $2.1 billion at collins, partially offset by lower organic sales of $0.7 billion at raytheon. the $0.7 billion decrease in net sales related to acquisitions and divestitures, net in 2022 compared to 2021, was primarily driven by the sale of our global training and services business within our raytheon segment in the fourth quarter of 2021. the decrease in other net sales of $0.3 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 represents the impact of foreign exchange.

the organic increase in total cost of sales in 2023 compared to 2022 of $5.7 billion was primarily due to the organic sales increases at pratt & whitney, collins, and raytheon noted above. the $0.1 billion decrease in cost of sales related to acquisitions and divestitures, net in 2023 compared to 2022, was primarily driven by the divestiture of a small non-core naval power business in the fourth quarter of 2022. the decrease in other cost of sales of $2.6 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was
37
table of contents primarily driven by a net reduction in cost of sales of $2.5 billion primarily reflecting our partners' share of the powder metal matter.
the organic increase in total cost of sales in 2022 compared to 2021 of $2.4 billion was primarily due to the organic sales increases at pratt & whitney and collins noted above. the decrease related to acquisitions and divestitures, net of $0.6 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the sale of our global training and services business within our raytheon segment in the fourth quarter of 2021. the decrease in other cost of sales of $0.2 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by charges recorded during the first quarter of 2022 at pratt & whitney and collins related to impairment of customer financing assets for products under lease, inventory reserves, purchase order obligations, and the impairment of contract fulfillment costs that are no longer recoverable, all due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to russia. see "note 1: basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles" within item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information.
restructuring actions relate to ongoing cost reduction efforts including workforce reductions and the consolidation of facilities.

research and development spending is subject to the variable nature of program development schedules and, therefore, year-over-year fluctuations in spending levels are expected.
the increase in company-funded research and development of $0.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, was primarily driven by increased spending on commercial program development at pratt & whitney and higher program expenses at collins, partially offset by decreased spend on other development programs. company-funded research and development in 2022 was relatively consistent with 2021.
the increase in customer-funded research and development of $0.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, was primarily driven by higher expenses on various commercial and military programs at collins and increased spending at pratt & whitney on military programs, partially offset by lower expenses on various programs at raytheon. the decrease in customer-funded research and

selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $0.2 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by a $0.1 billion charge at pratt & whitney related to a customer insolvency in the second quarter of 2023, costs related to our segment realignment and recently announced divestitures in 2023, and increased employee-related costs, partially offset by the absence of $0.1 billion of charges recorded in the first quarter of 2022 related to increased estimates for credit losses due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to russia. see "note 1: basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles" within item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information on russia sanctions.
selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $0.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by higher information technology-related costs at corporate, collins, and pratt & whitney, and higher combined expenses at collins and pratt & whitney, principally driven by higher employee-related costs and $0.1 billion of charges related to increased estimates for credit losses due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to russia.
we are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive. therefore, the amounts reflected above include the beneficial impact of previous restructuring actions on selling, general, and administrative expenses.

other income, net includes equity earnings in unconsolidated entities, royalty income, foreign exchange gains and losses, and other ongoing and non-recurring items.
the decrease in other income, net of $34 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the net unfavorable year-over-year impact of foreign exchange gains and losses of $79 million, which was more than offset by the absence of $111 million of charges associated with the disposition of three businesses in 2022, and a $68 million gain on sale of land during the first quarter of 2023. the remaining decrease was spread across individually less significant items.
the decrease in other income, net of $303 million in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to the absence of a $269 million gain on sale of raytheon's global training and services business recorded in 2021, $111 million of charges associated with the disposition of three businesses in 2022 including two non-core businesses at collins and a non-core naval power business at raytheon, and the absence of foreign government wage subsidies related to coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) at pratt & whitney of $41 million in 2021. the above items were partially offset by an accrual of $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the ongoing department of justice (doj) investigation into contract pricing matters at raytheon. see "note 2: acquisitions and dispositions" within item 8 of this form 10-k for further discussion on business dispositions.

the decrease in operating profit of $1.9 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by a decrease at pratt & whitney primarily driven by the $2.9 billion charge associated with the powder metal matter and a decrease in the change in our fas/cas operating adjustment, partially offset by an increase in operating profit at collins and raytheon, all of which are described below in "segment review."
the increase in operating profit of $0.4 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by a decrease in acquisition accounting adjustments, the operating performance at our operating segments, and a decrease in corporate and eliminations and other, partially offset by the change in our fas/cas operating adjustment, all of which are described below in "segment review."

the change in non-service pension income of $0.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by an increase in interest rates during 2022 and prior years' pension asset returns performing below our expected return on plan assets (eroa) assumption, partially offset by an increase in our 2023 eroa assumption.
the change in non-service pension income of $0.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the impact of an increase in interest rates, partially offset by prior years' pension asset returns exceeding our eroa assumption.

interest expense, net increased $0.2 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase in interest expense of $0.4 billion was primarily due to the long-term debt issuances in the first and the fourth quarters of 2023, interest and fees on short term loans related to an accelerated share repurchase (asr), and the increase in commercial paper activity in 2023. for additional discussion of the asr and associated funding, see "liquidity and financial condition" below. the change in other non-operating expense (income) of $0.1 billion was primarily driven by a change in the mark-to-market fair value of marketable securities held in trusts associated with certain of our nonqualified deferred compensation and employee benefit plans and an increase in dividend income.
interest expense, net in 2022 was relatively consistent with 2021.
income taxes

effective income tax rate           11.9   %           12.9   %           18.9   %
the lower 2023 effective tax rate compared to 2022 is primarily driven by a favorable impact related to the $2.9 billion charge associated with the powder metal matter driving lower pretax income in 2023 resulting in an approximate 4% benefit to the rate in 2023, and the absence of a 3.4% reduction in the 2022 effective tax rate associated with the $207 million of tax benefits recorded in 2022 related to legal entity and operational reorganizations.
the lower 2022 effective tax rate compared to 2021 is primarily driven by the absence of a net $108 million charge, a 2.2% tax rate increase in 2021, associated with the disposition of the forcepoint business and the global training and services business, and the absence of a $73 million charge, a 1.5% tax rate increase in 2021, for the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from the increase in the u.k. corporate tax rate to 25% enacted in 2021. additionally, the benefits associated with legal entity and operational reorganizations were lower in 2022 at $207 million, a 3.4% tax benefit in 2022, and $244 million, a 4.8% tax benefit, in 2021. the 2021 effective tax rate also includes higher net state income taxes as compared to 2022.

table of contents segment review as previously announced, effective july 1, 2023, we streamlined the structure of our core businesses to three principal business segments: collins aerospace (collins), pratt & whitney, and raytheon. all segment information is reflective of this new structure and prior period information has been recast to conform to our current period presentation.
for a detailed description of our businesses, see "business segments" within item 1 of this form 10-k.
segments are generally based on the management structure of the businesses and the grouping of similar operations, based on capabilities and technologies, where each management organization has general operating autonomy over diversified products and services. segment total net sales and operating profit (loss) include intercompany sales and profit, which are ultimately eliminated within eliminations and other, which also includes certain smaller non-reportable segments. segment results exclude certain acquisition accounting adjustments, the fas/cas operating adjustment, and certain corporate expenses, as further discussed below.
we present a fas/cas operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (prb) expense under the financial accounting standards (fas) requirements of u.s. gaap and our pension and prb expense under u.s. government cost accounting standards (cas) primarily related to our raytheon segment. while the ultimate liability for pension and prb costs under fas and cas is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. over time, we generally expect to recover the related raytheon pension and prb liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the u.s. government. collins and pratt & whitney generally record pension and prb expense on a fas basis. in connection with the segment realignment, prior period results were recast in order to maintain the segment cost recognition patterns described above.
we provide the organic change in net sales and operating profit (loss) for our segments as discussed above in "results of operations." we believe that these non-gaap measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. for pratt & whitney only, other also includes the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging at pratt & whitney canada due to its significance to pratt & whitney's overall operating results.
given the nature of our business, we believe that total net sales and operating profit (loss) (and the related operating profit (loss) margin percentage), which we disclose and discuss at the segment level, are most relevant to an understanding of management's view of our segment performance, as described below.
total net sales. total net sales by segment were as follows:

table of contents included in segment operating profit (loss) are estimate at completion (eac) adjustments, which relate to changes in operating profit and margin due to revisions to total estimated revenues and costs at completion. these changes may reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance, as well as changes in facts and assumptions related to contract options, contract modifications, incentive and award fees associated with program performance, customer activity levels, and other customer-directed changes. for a full description of our eac process, refer to "note 1: basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles" within item 8 of this form 10-k. given that we have thousands of individual contracts, and given the types and complexity of the assumptions and estimates we must make on an on-going basis and the nature of the work required to be performed under our contracts, we have both favorable and unfavorable eac adjustments in the ordinary course.
we had the following aggregate eac adjustments for the periods presented:

the change in net eac adjustments of $611 million in 2023 compared 2022 was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net eac adjustments at pratt & whitney and to a lesser extent at collins and raytheon. included in the change at pratt & whitney was the unfavorable impact of $133 million recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost to our aftermarket contracts resulting from the powder metal matter and an unfavorable impact of approximately $60 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost on a military program. the change in net eac adjustments at pratt & whitney also includes the absence of a $50 million favorable contract adjustment resulting from a contract modification on a commercial aftermarket program in the second quarter of 2022. the change at collins was spread across numerous individual programs, with no individual or common significant driver. the change at raytheon was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net eac adjustments related to certain fixed price development contracts and $51 million of unfavorable eac adjustments related to significant contract options exercised in 2023.
the change in net eac adjustments of $147 million in 2022 compared 2021 was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net eac adjustments at raytheon, including the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, spread across numerous individual programs, with no individual or common significant driver, and includes the impact of continued supply chain and labor market constraints. this unfavorable change was partially offset by a favorable change in net eac adjustments at collins, spread across numerous individual programs with no individual or common significant driver, and a favorable change in net eac adjustments at pratt & whitney primarily due to a $50 million favorable contract adjustment resulting from a contract modification on a commercial aftermarket program in the second quarter of 2022.
significant eac adjustments, when they occur, are discussed in each business segment's discussion below.
backlog and defense bookings. total backlog was approximately $196 billion and $175 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. our backlog by segment, which excludes intercompany backlog, was as follows at december 31:

total backlog                    $196                   $175
included in total backlog is defense backlog of $78 billion and $69 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. our defense operations consist primarily of our raytheon business and operations in the defense businesses within our collins and pratt & whitney segments. defense bookings were approximately $51 billion, $47 billion, and $40 billion for 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively.
backlog, which is equivalent to our rpo for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., idiq type contracts). backlog generally increases with bookings and/or orders and
43
table of contents generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations, and cost underruns on cost-type contracts as discussed further below.
we believe defense bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense operations and are an indicator of potential future changes in these operations' total net sales, because we cannot recognize revenues under a new contract without first having a booking in the current or a preceding period. defense bookings generally represent the dollar value of new external defense contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated.
defense bookings exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., idiq type contracts). we reflect contract cancellations and terminations, as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, directly as an adjustment to backlog in the period in which the cancellation or termination occurs and the impact is determinable. contract cancellations and terminations also include contract underruns on cost-type programs.

2023 compared with 2022
the organic sales increase of $3.2 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily relates to higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of $2.1 billion, including increases across all aftermarket sales channels. these increases were principally driven by the continued recovery of commercial air traffic which has resulted in an increase in flight hours. commercial aerospace oem sales increased $1.1 billion due to increased production rates in narrow-body, wide-body, and business jets. military sales were relatively consistent in 2023 compared to 2022.
the increase in other net sales of $0.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to net favorable customer settlements in 2023, including a $112 million favorable customer settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by a $57 million charge related to a customer litigation matter recorded in the third quarter 2023.
the organic operating profit increase of $0.9 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to higher commercial aftermarket volume and favorable mix, partially offset by lower commercial aerospace oem as drop through on volume was more than offset by higher production costs. this increase in commercial aerospace operating profit was partially offset by $0.2 billion of higher selling, general and administrative expenses and research and developments costs primarily due to increased employee-related costs. military operating profit decreased $0.1 billion primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher production costs.
the increase in other operating profit of $0.2 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the absence of $141 million of pretax charges related to global sanctions and export controls with respect to russia recorded in 2022, the absence of $69 million of charges associated with the disposition of two non-core businesses in 2022, and the net favorable customer

table of contents settlements discussed above. the above items were partially offset by $62 million of divestiture costs related to the pending sale of our actuation and flight control business. see "note 2: acquisitions and dispositions" within item 8 of this form 10-k for further discussion on business dispositions.
restructuring actions relate to ongoing cost reduction efforts driven by various workforce reductions.
2022 compared with 2021
the organic sales increase of $2.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily relates to higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of $1.7 billion, including increases across all aftermarket sales channels, and higher commercial aerospace oem sales of $1.0 billion, both principally driven by the recovery of commercial air traffic which has resulted in an increase in flight hours, aircraft fleet utilization, and narrow-body commercial oem volume growth. these increases were partially offset by lower military sales of $0.6 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower material receipts and decreased volume.
the organic operating profit increase of $0.6 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $1.2 billion, principally driven by the higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales discussed above, partially offset by the absence of a favorable $52 million impact from a contract-related matter in 2021. the increase in commercial aerospace operating profit was partially offset by lower military operating profit of $0.4 billion, principally driven by the lower military sales discussed above, and higher selling, general, and administrative expenses of $0.2 billion, which includes the benefits of cost reduction initiatives.
the decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the disposition of two non-core businesses in the second quarter of 2022.
the decrease in other operating profit of $0.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily relates to $141 million of pretax charges recorded in the first quarter of 2022 related to increased estimates for credit losses, inventory reserves, recognition of purchase order obligations, and a loss resulting from the exit of our investment in a russia-based joint venture, all due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to russia. in addition, we recognized $69 million of charges associated with the disposition of two non-core businesses in the second quarter of 2022. see "note 1: basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles" within item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information on russia sanctions.

2023 compared with 2022
the organic sales increase of $3.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily reflects higher commercial aftermarket sales of $1.9 billion, primarily due to an increase in volume, content, and favorable mix as the commercial aerospace environment continues to recover. the increase also includes higher commercial oem sales of $0.9 billion, primarily driven by higher volume and favorable mix. military sales increased $0.3 billion, primarily due to higher f135 sustainment volume.
the other net sales decrease of $5.4 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the charge recognized in the third quarter of 2023 related to the powder metal matter.
the organic operating profit increase of $0.4 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $0.6 billion, principally due to the aftermarket sales increase discussed above, partially offset by lower commercial oem operating profit as the oem volume increase combined with higher production costs more than offset the benefit from favorable mix. commercial aerospace operating profit in 2023 also benefited from two favorable contract matters totaling approximately $120 million, which was partially offset by the absence of a prior year $50 million favorable contract adjustment resulting from a contract modification on a commercial aftermarket contract. military operating profit was relatively consistent compared to 2022. the increase from the military sales volume was more than offset by higher production costs and an unfavorable eac adjustment of approximately $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. higher research and development expenses were partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses.
the change in other operating profit (loss) of $2.9 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the charge recognized in the third quarter of 2023 related to the powder metal matter of $2.9 billion and a $181 million charge related to a customer insolvency during the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by the absence of $155 million of pretax charges recorded in the first quarter of 2022 related to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to russia. see "note 1: basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles" within item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information on russia sanctions.
restructuring actions relate to ongoing cost reduction efforts including the consolidation of facilities and workforce reductions.
2022 compared with 2021
the organic sales increase of $2.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily reflects higher commercial aftermarket sales of $1.8 billion primarily due to an increase in shop visits and related spare part sales as the commercial aerospace environment continues to recover. the increase also includes higher commercial oem sales of $0.9 billion driven by favorable mix and higher volume on commercial engine shipments. these increases were partially offset by lower military sales of $0.2 billion primarily due to lower sales on f135 production volume and lower volume on legacy aftermarket programs, partially offset by higher f135 sustainment volume.
the organic operating profit increase of $0.8 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $1.1 billion principally due to the aftermarket sales volume increase and favorable oem mix. the organic profit increase also includes slightly higher military operating profit primarily driven by favorable mix. these increases were partially offset by a combined increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses and research and development costs of $0.3 billion. the year over year increase in commercial aerospace operating profit includes a $50 million favorable contract adjustment on a commercial aftermarket program in the second quarter of 2022. in 2021, organic profit included approximately $50 million related to foreign government wage subsidies due to covid-19.
the decrease in other operating profit of $0.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to $155 million of pretax charges recorded in the first quarter of 2022 related to impairment of customer financing assets for products under lease, increased estimates for credit losses, inventory reserves, and recognition of purchase order obligations, all due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to russia. see "note 1: basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles" within item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information on russia sanctions.
defense bookings - in addition to a number of smaller bookings, in 2023 pratt & whitney booked $2.5 billion for f135 production, $2.2 billion for f135 sustainment, $1.7 billion for f117 sustainment, $751 million for f119 sustainment, $355

2023 compared with 2022
the organic sales increase of $1.3 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to higher net sales of $0.5 billion from advanced technology programs, $0.3 billion from naval power programs, $0.3 billion from air power programs, and $0.2 billion from cybersecurity, intelligence and services programs. the increase in advanced technology programs includes higher net sales on an advanced development program awarded in the third quarter of 2022, and higher net sales on certain classified programs awarded in 2022. the increase in naval power programs was due to higher volumes on naval strike missile (nsm) and aim-9x programs. the increase in air power programs includes higher net sales on the stormbreaker program, driven by awards in the first and fourth quarters of 2023 and higher net sales on the advanced medium range air-to-air missile (amraam) program, driven by an award in the second quarter of 2023. the increase in cybersecurity, intelligence and services programs was driven by certain classified programs as well as federal and civil programs.
the organic operating profit decrease of $0.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to an unfavorable change in mix and other performance of $0.1 billion, and an unfavorable net change in eac adjustments of $0.1 billion, partially offset by higher volume of $0.2 billion. the unfavorable change in mix and other performance was primarily driven by an expected decline in certain higher margin international programs and higher volume on various lower margin programs including early production phase programs. the net change in eac adjustments was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net eac adjustments related to certain fixed price development contracts and $51 million of unfavorable eac adjustments related to significant contract options exercised in 2023. the increase in volume was principally driven by the higher net sales discussed above.
the increase in other operating profit in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by the absence of a $42 million charge in 2022 associated with a divestiture of a small non-core naval power business, with the remaining change spread across multiple items.
the decrease in net sales due to acquisitions / divestitures, net in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily relates to the divestiture of a small non-core naval power business in the fourth quarter of 2022.
restructuring actions relate to ongoing cost reduction efforts including workforce reductions.
2022 compared with 2021
table of contents the organic sales decrease of $0.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to lower net sales of $0.6 billion from our land warfare and air defense programs and lower net sales of $0.2 billion from our air power programs, partially offset by higher net sales of $0.3 billion from our strategic missile defense programs. the decrease in land warfare and air defense programs was primarily due to lower sales on certain international air and missile defense programs primarily driven by lower material receipts as a result of supply chain constraints and anticipated decreases in production. the decrease in air power programs included lower net sales on paveway programs and amraam programs. the increase in strategic missile defense programs included higher net sales from the next generation interceptor (ngi) program.
the organic operating profit decrease of $0.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to an unfavorable change in mix and other performance of $0.3 billion, due to unfavorable program mix, and an unfavorable net change in eac adjustments of $0.3 billion. the net unfavorable change in eac adjustments was driven by numerous programs and included the impact of continued supply chain and labor market constraints.
the decrease in other operating profit in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by a $239 million gain, net of transaction costs, in 2021 on the sale of the global training and services business, as further discussed in "note 2: acquisitions and dispositions" within item 8 of this form 10-k, and a $42 million charge in 2022 associated with a divestiture of a small non-core naval power business.
the decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily relates to the sale of the global training and services business in the fourth quarter of 2021.
backlog and bookings- backlog was $52 billion at december 31, 2023 compared to $47 billion at december 31, 2022. in addition to a number of smaller bookings, in 2023, raytheon booked $7.8 billion on a number of classified contracts, $2.8 billion to provide guidance enhanced missiles (gem-t) for nato support and procurement agency (nspa), $1.2 billion for amraam for the u.s. air force and navy and international customers, $1.2 billion to provide patriot air defense systems to switzerland, $663 million on stormbreaker for the u.s. air force and navy, $650 million on next generation jammer mid-band (ngj-mb) for the u.s. navy and the government of australia, $619 million on the spy-6 hardware production and sustainment contract for the u.s. navy, $489 million on excalibur for the u.s. army and international customers, $412 million on next generation short range interceptor (ngsri) for the u.s. army, $408 million for hypersonic attack cruise missile (hacm) for the u.s. air force, $383 million to provide training and technical support for hawk and patriot air defense systems for an international customer, $368 million for tube-launched, optically-tracked, wireless-guided (tow) missiles for the u.s. army, u.s. marine corps, and international customers, $332 million on cyber defense services contracts for certain federal and civil customers, $321 million for silent knight radars to u.s. special operations command (ussocom), $297 million to provide national advanced surface-to-air missile system (nasams) to ukraine, $266 million to deliver airborne radars to an international customer, $265 million for javelin for the u.s. army and international customers, $251 million for aim-9x sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles for the u.s. navy and air force and international customers, $237 million for cleavar, an integrated u.s. army counter- unmanned aircraft systems (c-uas) defense system, $234 million on nsm for the u.s. navy, and $206 million for the air and missile defense radar (amdr) program for the u.s. navy.

the increase in eliminations and other net sales of $295 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to an increase in intersegment eliminations, principally driven by collins. eliminations and other operating profit in 2023 was relatively consistent with 2022.
table of contents the increase in eliminations and other net sales of $159 million in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to an increase in intersegment eliminations, principally driven by collins. eliminations and other operating profit in 2022 was relatively consistent with 2021.
the change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $43 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to the ltamds program, which are included in the raytheon segment beginning in 2023, partially offset by an increase in costs related to the segment realignment, with the remaining change spread across multiple items.
the change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $234 million in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by an accrual of $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the ongoing doj investigation into contract pricing matters at raytheon, a decrease in expenses related to the ltamds program and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by an increase in information technology-related costs.
fas/cas operating adjustment the segment results of raytheon include pension and prb expense as determined under u.s. government cas, which we generally recover through the pricing of our products and services to the u.s. government. the difference between our cas expense and the fas service cost attributable to these segments under u.s. gaap is the fas/cas operating adjustment. the fas/cas operating adjustment results in consolidated pension expense in operating profit equal to the service cost component of fas expense under u.s. gaap. the segment results of collins and pratt & whitney generally include fas service cost. in connection with the segment realignment, prior period results were recast in order to maintain the segment cost recognition patterns described above.
the cas expense calculation is different from the fas requirements and calculation methodology. while the ultimate liability for pension costs under fas and cas is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. our cas pension expense is comprised primarily of cas service cost and amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected, changes in assumptions, or changes in plan provisions. unlike fas, cas expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded on a cas basis. consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under cas due to our asset or liability experience, our cas expense will change accordingly.
the components of the fas/cas operating adjustment were as follows:

the change in our fas/cas operating adjustment of $272 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was driven by a $463 million decrease in cas expense, partially offset by a $191 million decrease in fas service cost. the decrease in cas expense was primarily due to changes to the raytheon company domestic pension plans announced in december 2020 that were effective december 31, 2022, and the recognition of historical cas gain/loss experience. similarly, the decrease in fas service cost was primarily due to changes to the raytheon company domestic pension plans announced in december 2020 that were effective december 31, 2022. refer to "note 10: employee benefit plans" within item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information on the raytheon company domestic pension plan change.
the change in our fas/cas operating adjustment of $255 million in 2022 compared to 2021 was driven by a $292 million decrease in cas expense, partially offset by a $37 million decrease in fas service cost. the decrease in cas expense was primarily due to an increase in applicable discount rates as a result of u.s. qualified pension plan funding relief included in the american rescue plan act of 2021 (arpa).
acquisition accounting adjustments acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment, if applicable. these adjustments are not considered part of management's evaluation of segment results.

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities and the timing of such activities. our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. in addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, customer financing requirements, investments in and divestitures of businesses, dividends, common stock repurchases, pension funding, access to the commercial paper markets, adequacy of available bank lines of credit, redemptions of debt, and the ability to attract long-term capital at satisfactory terms.
at december 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.6 billion, of which approximately 32% was held by rtx's foreign subsidiaries. we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. the company intends to repatriate certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the u.s. taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings have been recorded. for the remainder of the company's undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, rtx will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings.
our ability to access global debt markets and the related cost of these borrowings depends on the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. as previously disclosed, in august 2023, s&p global downgraded our credit rating from a-/negative to bbb+/stable, and our credit rating with moody's investors service remained at baa1/stable. subsequently, in october 2023, both s&p global and moody's investors service outlook changed from stable to negative when we entered into the asr transactions. though the company expects to continue having adequate access to funds, further declines in our credit ratings or company outlook could result in higher borrowing costs.

table of contents as of december 31, 2023, we had a revolving credit agreement with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $5.0 billion. this agreement was renewed in august 2023 and expires in august 2028. as of december 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement. the company's $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement scheduled to expire in september 2023, was terminated in august 2023, and there were no outstanding borrowings at the time of termination. in addition, at december 31, 2023, approximately $0.7 billion was available under short-term lines of credit with local banks primarily at our international subsidiaries.
from time to time, we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions, pension contributions, debt refinancing, dividend payments, and repurchases of our common stock. the commercial paper notes have original maturities of not more than 364 days from the date of issuance. as of december 31, 2023, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $5.0 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement. we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at december 31, 2023.
on october 24, 2023, we entered into a bridge loan with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $10.0 billion, to fund an asr and pay related fees and expenses. the $10.0 billion bridge loan was paid in full and terminated in the fourth quarter of 2023 upon receipt of proceeds from the $4.0 billion term loan facilities and the $6.0 billion of long-term debt issuances as described below and cash on hand.

(1)    the net proceeds received from these debt issuances and term loans, along with cash on hand, were used to fund the repayment of the bridge loan, which was used to fund the asr.
(2)    the net proceeds from the issuances were used to fund repayment of the 3.650% notes due august 16, 2023 and the 3.700% notes due december 15, 2023, with the remaining proceeds used for general corporate purposes.
during 2023, we made the following repayments of long-term debt:

we have an existing universal shelf registration statement, which we filed with the securities and exchange commission (sec) on september 22, 2022, for an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future issuance, subject to our internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement.
the company offers voluntary supply chain finance (scf) programs with global financial institutions which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the company to the financial institutions at a rate that leverages our credit rating, which might be beneficial to them. our suppliers' participation in the scf programs does not impact or change our terms and conditions with those suppliers, and therefore, we have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the programs. in addition, we do not pay for any of the costs of the programs incurred by those suppliers that choose to participate, and have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to sales of receivables made by those suppliers. as such, the scf programs do not impact our working capital, cash flows, or overall liquidity.
we believe our cash on hand and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. further, we continue to have access to the commercial paper markets and our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain debt or table of contents equity financing, as well as the availability under committed credit lines, provides additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required or appropriate.
cash flow - operating activities
(dollars in millions)                                                                     2023                    2022                    2021
net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations          $7,883                   $7,168                  $7,142
2023 compared with 2022 operating activities net income from continuing operations in 2023 included a $2.9 billion charge related to the powder metal matter, which had no effect on cash flow in the period. this charge also had the effect of increasing accrued liabilities by $2.8 billion in 2023. excluding the impact of this charge, the $0.7 billion favorable change in cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2023 compared to 2022, is primarily driven by higher net income from continuing operations after adjustments for depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax benefit, stock compensation cost, and net periodic pension and other postretirement income. also contributing to the change in cash flows is a net favorable impact of net contract assets and liabilities due to the timing of collections, a net decrease in tax payments further discussed below, and lower inventory receipts compared to 2022. these favorable changes were partially offset by higher accounts receivable as a result of increased sales volume and timing of collections and a decrease in factoring.
the company enters into various factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its receivables. factoring activity resulted in a decrease of approximately $0.8 billion in cash provided by operating activities during 2023, compared to an increase of approximately $2.3 billion in cash provided by operating activities during 2022. factoring activity includes amounts factored on certain aerospace receivables at the customers' request for which we may be compensated by the customer.
2022 compared with 2021 operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities in 2022 were relatively consistent with 2021 and benefited from an improvement in working capital, which was more than offset by the net increase in tax payments resulting from a change in tax law discussed below. included in the change in working capital was a favorable impact from accounts receivable driven by higher collections resulting from increased sales volume and a related increase in factoring as discussed below. the change in working capital also included a favorable impact from contract assets in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the timing of billings and collections, and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily driven by higher inventory receipts, deferred revenue, and advanced payments. this impact was largely offset by an unfavorable impact from inventory principally due to increases to support sales volume growth.
higher sales volume in 2022 supported increased factoring activity that resulted in approximately $2.3 billion of increased cash flows provided by operating activities during 2022, compared to a decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities of approximately $0.2 billion in cash provided by operating activities during 2021.
operating activities we made pension and prb contributions to trusts of $157 million, $94 million, and $59 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. included in the 2023 contribution of $157 million is a discretionary noncash contribution of $50 million made in rtx common stock to our u.s. qualified pension plans.
we make both required and discretionary contributions to our pension plans. required contributions are primarily determined by employee retirement income security act of 1974 (erisa) funding rules, which require us to fully fund our u.s qualified pension plans over a rolling seven-year period as determined annually based on the pension protection act of 2006 (ppa) calculated funded status at the beginning of each year. the funding requirements are primarily based on the year's expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities, which are dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and actuarial assumptions.
global pension and prb cash funding requirements are expected to be approximately $0.3 billion in 2024, which includes benefit payments to be paid directly by the company. we can contribute cash or rtx shares to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations. as of december 31, 2023, the total investment by the u.s. qualified pension plans in rtx shares was less than 1% of total plan assets.
we made net income tax payments of $1.5 billion, $2.4 billion, and $1.1 billion in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. a provision enacted in the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 related to the capitalization of research and experimental expenditures for tax purposes became effective on january 1, 2022. as such, we made incremental income tax payments of $1.6 billion in table of contents
2022. in september and december 2023, the internal revenue service issued interim guidance, retroactive to 2022, clarifying the capitalization requirements for certain types of research and experimental expenditures. the company's analysis indicates the guidance provided in the notices will result in fewer costs being subject to capitalization, and as such, costs previously required to be capitalized are now deductible in the year incurred. these notices resulted in the company making lower income tax payments in 2023 compared to 2022.
included in cash flows from operating activities are payments related to our operating lease obligations. see "note 11: leases" within item 8 of this form 10-k for actual and expected payments on operating lease obligations.
in addition, the majority of our cash flows for purchase obligations are classified as cash flows from operating activities. we expect future payments related to our purchase obligations to be $30.6 billion, of which $20.1 billion is payable in 2024. purchase obligations include current amounts committed for the purchase of goods and services under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders, and do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future. approximately 50% of our purchase obligations described above represent purchase orders for products to be delivered under firm contracts with the u.s. government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses.
while the timing of cash flows relating to the powder metal matter are subject to a number of variables, we estimate the $2.8 billion of other accrued liabilities, which principally relates to our 51% share of an accrual for expected customer compensation, to be utilized consistent with the timing of execution of the fleet management plan and period of increased aircraft on ground levels. we currently estimate cash outflows related to the powder metal matter of approximately $1.3 billion in 2024.

our investing activities primarily include capital expenditures, cash investments in customer financing assets, investments in and dispositions of businesses, payments related to our collaboration intangible assets and contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms, and settlements of derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments.
2023 compared with 2022 investing activities the $0.2 billion change in cash flows used in investing activities in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily related to an increase in payments for intangible assets and capital expenditures, both of which are described below, partially offset by the timing of our derivative contract settlements.
2022 compared with 2021 investing activities the $1.5 billion change in cash flows used in investing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily relates to the absence of 2021 investments in and dispositions of businesses, as discussed below.
investing activities there were no significant acquisitions in 2023 or 2022. investments in businesses in 2021 of $1.1 billion primarily related to the acquisitions of flightaware at collins and seakr engineering inc. at raytheon. for additional detail, see "note 2: acquisitions and dispositions" within item 8 of this form 10-k.
there were no significant dispositions of businesses in 2023 or 2022. dispositions of businesses in 2021 of $1.9 billion, net of cash transferred, primarily related to the sale of our forcepoint business and the sale of our global training and services business within raytheon. for additional detail, see "note 2: acquisitions and dispositions" within item 8 of this form 10-k.
capital expenditures were $2.4 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.1 billion in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. capital expenditures increased $127 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to investments in production facilities at pratt & whitney and raytheon. capital expenditures increased $154 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to investments in production facilities at pratt & whitney.
payments on customer financing assets were $117 million, $150 million, and $231 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. the decrease in payments in 2023 compared to 2022 and 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to fewer engines added to our leased asset pool. receipts from customer financing assets were $212 million, $179 million, and $389 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. the decrease in receipts in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the absence of the 2021 sale and leaseback transaction. refer to "note 11: leases" within item 8 of this form 10-k for additional discussion of this transaction.
table of contents in 2023, 2022, and 2021 we increased other intangible assets by approximately $751 million, $487 million, $308 million, respectively, primarily related to collaboration payment commitments made under our 2012 agreement to acquire rolls-royce's collaboration interests in international aero engines ag (iae) and exclusivity payments made on contractual commitments included within intangible assets. at december 31, 2023, we had commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments, including exclusivity and collaboration payment commitments, of approximately $14.6 billion, on a gross basis before reduction for our collaboration partners' share. refer to "note 17: commitments and contingencies" within item 8 of this form 10-k for further details on our commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments.
as discussed in "note 13: financial instruments" within item 8 of this form 10-k, we enter into derivative instruments primarily for risk management purposes, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments and those utilized as economic hedges. we operate internationally and in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices. these fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing, and operating the business. we have used derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts, and options, to manage certain foreign currency, interest rate, and commodity price exposures. during 2023 we had net cash receipts of $14 million, and during 2022 and 2021 we had net cash payments of $205 million and $16 million, respectively, from the settlement of these derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments.

our financing activities primarily include the issuance and repayment of commercial paper and other short-term and long-term debt, payment of dividends, and stock repurchases.
2023 compared with 2022 financing activities the $1.3 billion change in cash flows used in financing activities in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by long-term debt proceeds of $12.9 billion, partially offset by higher share repurchases of $10.1 billion as discussed below, an increase in repayment of commercial paper borrowings, net of $1.0 billion, and repayments of long-term debt of $0.6 billion.
2022 compared with 2021 financing activities the $0.9 billion change in cash flows used in financing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the absence of 2021 repayments of long-term debt, including debt extinguishment costs, net of issuances of $0.8 billion and an increase in commercial paper borrowings, net of $0.7 billion, partially offset by an increase in share repurchases of $0.5 billion, as discussed below.
financing activities included in cash flows from financing activities are payments related to our long-term debt, including both interest and principal payments. a summary of our long-term debt commitments as of december 31, 2023 was as follows:

table of contents at december 31, 2023, management had remaining authority to repurchase approximately $1.0 billion of our common stock. on october 21, 2023, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $11 billion of our common stock, replacing the previous program announced on december 12, 2022. under the 2023 program, shares may be purchased on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, under accelerated share repurchase programs, and under plans complying with rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. we may also reacquire shares outside of the program in connection with the surrender of shares to cover taxes on vesting of restricted stock, and as required under our employee savings plan. our ability to repurchase shares is subject to applicable law.
on october 24, 2023, we entered into accelerated share repurchase (asr) agreements with certain financial institution counterparties to repurchase shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10 billion. pursuant to the asr agreements, we made aggregate payments of $10 billion on october 26, 2023, and received initial deliveries of approximately 108.4 million shares of our common stock at a price of $78.38 per share, representing approximately 85% of the shares expected to be repurchased. see "note 18: equity" within item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information.
our board of directors authorized the following cash dividends for the years ended december 31:

on february 2, 2024, the board of directors declared a dividend of $0.59 per share payable march 21, 2024 to shareowners of record at the close of business on february 23, 2024.
critical accounting estimates preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates.
long-term contract accounting. we recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace aftermarket contracts. we measure progress toward completion of these contracts on a percentage of completion basis, generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management's judgment. we review our estimates at completion (eacs) at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. for significant contracts, we review our eacs more frequently. due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the company's performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many inputs, and requires significant judgment by management on a contract-by-contract basis. as part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. the risks and opportunities relate to management's judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials including any impact from changing costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. in particular, fixed-price development programs involve significant management judgment, as development contracts by nature have elements that have not been done before and thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost changes. cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (icip) agreements, required under certain contracts. these obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature. if cash is paid to a customer to satisfy our offset obligations it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price. changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation's percentage-of-completion in the current period. a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. our eac adjustments also include the establishment of, and changes to, loss provisions for our contracts accounted for on a percentage-of-completion basis.
table of contents net eac adjustments had the following impact on our operating results:
(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)                                                             2023                    2022                                   2021

(1)    amounts reflect a u.s. statutory tax rate of 21%, which approximates our tax rate on our eac adjustments.
costs incurred for engineering and development of certain aerospace products under contracts with customers are capitalized as contract fulfillment costs, to the extent recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding, and subsequently amortized as the products are delivered to the customer. the estimation of contract costs, and margin, considered as part of this recoverability assessment requires significant judgment. see "note 1: basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles" within item 8 of this form 10-k for further discussion.
income taxes. management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits, which may be realized over an extended period of time. for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided.
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, projections of future taxable income, the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards. our projections of future taxable income include estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing, and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. conversely, if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made.
in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. significant judgment is required when assessing our income tax positions and in determining our tax expense and benefits. management assesses our tax positions based on an evaluation of the facts, circumstances, applicable tax laws, including regulations, case law, and other interpretive guidance, as well as any other relevant information. adjustments to our tax positions are made as new information becomes available or when our assessments change. in addition, we have entered into certain internal legal entity restructuring transactions necessary to effectuate the separation of carrier global corporation (carrier) and otis worldwide corporation (otis). we have accrued tax on these transactions based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and our determination of appropriate entity valuations. see "note 1: basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles" and "note 12: income taxes" within item 8 of this form 10-k for further discussion.
management has determined that the distributions of carrier and otis on april 3, 2020, and certain related internal business separation transactions, qualified as tax-free under applicable law. in making these determinations, we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdictions to our facts and circumstances and obtained tax rulings from the relevant taxing authorities, tax opinions, and/or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. if the completed distributions of carrier or otis, in each case, or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the company's business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity in future reporting periods.
goodwill and intangible assets. the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist of patents, trademarks/tradenames, developed technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. the fair value for acquired customer relationship intangibles is determined as of the acquisition date based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the future after-tax cash flows arising from the follow-on revenue from customer relationships that existed on the acquisition date over their estimated lives, including the probability of expected future contract renewals and revenue, less a contributory assets charge, all of which is discounted to present value. the fair value of the trademark and tradename intangible assets are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. under this method, a table of contents royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. see "note 1: basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles" within item 8 of this form 10-k for further details.
also included within intangible assets are exclusivity assets, which are payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide products on new commercial aerospace platforms. at december 31, 2023, our exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $3.1 billion, and our remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, were approximately $5.7 billion. we assess the recoverability of these intangibles, which is dependent upon our assumptions around the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platforms, including the associated aftermarket revenue streams, and the related future cash flows.
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. the impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair values. if the carrying value exceeds the fair value, then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. in testing our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments. for the quantitative assessments that are performed for goodwill, we primarily utilize a combination of discounted cash flows (dcf) and market-based valuation methodologies. for the quantitative assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets, fair value is primarily based on the relief from royalty method. these quantitative assessments incorporate significant assumptions that include sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates, royalty rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions.
effective july 1, 2023, we implemented a new organizational structure resulting in a change from four principal business segments to three principal business segments. as a result, we reassigned goodwill and customer relationship intangibles to our new segment structure. goodwill was reassigned on a relative fair value basis, and we tested goodwill related to the impacted reporting units immediately before and after the reassignment and determined that no impairment existed.
we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of october 1, 2023 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. we assessed all of our reporting units using qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that any individual reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value (step 0) and determined that no further testing was required.
the company continuously monitors and evaluates relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact our significant assumptions used in testing goodwill, including changes to u.s. treasury rates and equity risk premiums, tax rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the company's market capitalization, and general industry, market, and macro-economic conditions. it is possible that future changes in such circumstances, or in the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units, could require the company to record a non-cash impairment charge.
we also completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing as of october 1, 2023 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of these assets were necessary. as noted above, our indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analysis involves significant assumptions that are subject to variability. material changes in these assumptions could occur and result in impairments in future periods.
contingent liabilities. as described in "note 17: commitments and contingencies" within item 8 of this form 10-k, contractual, regulatory, and other matters in the normal course of business may arise that subject us to claims or litigation, including with respect to matters relating to technical issues on programs, government contracts, performance and operating cost guarantees, employee benefit plans, legal, and environmental, health and safety matters. in particular, the design, development, production, and support of aerospace technologies is inherently complex and subject to risk. technical issues associated with these technologies may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. these impacts could be material to the company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. additionally, we have significant contracts with the u.s. government, subject to government oversight and audit, which may require significant adjustment of contract prices. we accrue for liabilities associated with these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. estimating our liability based on both the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes, and the costs associated with these matters, requires significant judgment. the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters could result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution.
pratt & whitney has determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the pw1100 gtf fleet, which powers the a320neo. this determination was made pursuant to pratt &
table of contents whitney's safety management system.
on august 4, 2023, pratt & whitney issued a special instruction (si), to operators of pw1100 gtf powered a320neo aircraft, which required accelerated inspections and engine removals covering an initial subset of operational engines, no later than september 15, 2023. during the third quarter of 2023, through its safety management system, pratt & whitney continued its engineering and industrial assessment which resulted in an updated fleet management plan for the remaining pw1100 fleet. this updated plan requires a combination of part inspections and retirements for some high pressure turbine and high pressure compressor parts made from affected raw material. guidance to affected operators was released via service bulletins (sb) and si in november 2023 and this guidance is expected to be reflected in one or more airworthiness directives issued by the federal aviation administration (faa). consistent with previous information, the actions are expected to result in significant incremental shop visits through the end of 2026. as a result, pratt & whitney expects a significant increase in aircraft on ground levels for the pw1100 powered a320neo fleet through 2026.
as a result of anticipated increased aircraft on ground levels and expected compensation to customers for this disruption, as well as incremental maintenance costs resulting from increased inspections and shop visits, pratt & whitney recorded a pre-tax operating profit charge in the third quarter of 2023 of $2.9 billion, reflecting pratt & whitney's net 51% program share of the pw1100 program. this reflects our current best estimate of expected customer compensation for the estimated duration of the disruption as well as the eac adjustment impact of this matter to pratt & whitney's long-term maintenance contracts. the incremental costs to the business's long-term maintenance contracts include the estimated cost of additional inspections, replacement of parts, and other related impacts.
the $2.9 billion charge is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a reduction of sales of $5.4 billion which was partially offset by a net reduction of cost of sales of $2.5 billion primarily representing our partners' 49% share of this charge. this resulted in a net increase in other accrued liabilities of $2.8 billion, which principally relates to our 51% share of an accrual for expected customer compensation. while the timing of settlement is subject to a number of variables, we expect the $2.8 billion of other accrued liabilities to be utilized consistent with the timing of execution of the fleet management plan and period of increased aircraft on ground levels referenced above. there was no utilization of the accrual during the fourth quarter of 2023.
other engine models within pratt & whitney's fleet contain parts manufactured with affected powder metal, and while pratt & whitney continues to evaluate the impact of this powder metal issue on other engine models within its fleet, we do not currently believe there will be any significant financial impact with respect to these other engine models. the financial impact of the powder metal issue is based on historical experience and is subject to various assumptions and judgments, most notably, the number and expected timing of shop visits, inspection results and scope of work to be performed, turnaround time, availability of parts, available capacity at overhaul facilities and outcomes of negotiations with impacted customers. while these assumptions reflect our best estimates at this time, they are subject to variability. potential changes to these assumptions and actual incurred costs could significantly affect the estimates inherent in our financial statements and could have a material effect on the company's results of operations for the periods in which they are recognized.
employee benefit plans. we sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and prb plans. assumptions used to calculate our funded status are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators. they are evaluated annually at december 31 and when significant events require a mid-year remeasurement. a change in any of these assumptions or actual experience that differs from these assumptions are subject to recognition in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit (income) expense reported in the consolidated financial statements.
assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans require judgement. major assumptions include the discount rate and eroa. other assumptions include mortality rates, demographic assumptions (such as retirement age), rate of increase in employee compensation levels, and health care cost increase projections.
the weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension and prb liabilities are generally based on yield curves developed using high-quality corporate bonds, which are subject to macroeconomic factors, as well as plan specific expected cash flows. for our significant plans, we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost table of contents components of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows.
the following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and prb plan liabilities and net periodic benefit income to a 25 basis point change in the discount rates for benefit obligations, interest cost, and service cost as of december 31, 2023:
(dollars in millions)                                    increase in discount                    decrease in discount rate of 25 bps                                rate of 25 bps projected benefit obligation increase (decrease)         $(1,173)                                     $1,226
net periodic benefit income increase (decrease)          (13)                       12
the discount rate sensitivities assume no change in the shape of the yield curve that will be applied to the projected cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost. a flattening of the yield curve results in a narrowing of the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would decrease our net periodic benefit income. conversely, a steepening of the yield curve would result in an increase in the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would increase our net periodic benefit income.
the eroa is the average rate of earnings expected over the long-term on assets invested to fund anticipated future benefit payment obligations. in determining the eroa assumption, we consider the target asset allocation of plan assets, as well as economic and other indicators of future performance. we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in determining the appropriate capital market assumptions. return projections are validated using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves, credit spreads, and risk premiums to project long-term prospective returns. differences between actual asset returns in a given year and the eroa do not necessarily indicate a change in the assumption is required, as the eroa represents the expected average returns over a long-term horizon.
net periodic benefit income is also sensitive to changes in the eroa. an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the eroa would have increased or decreased our 2023 net periodic benefit income by approximately $133 million.

government matters as described above in "critical accounting estimates-contingent liabilities," our contracts with the u.s. government are subject to audits. such audits may recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations, or that certain payments be delayed or withheld. we are also the subject of one or more investigations and legal proceedings initiated by the u.s. government with respect to government contract matters. see "note 17: commitments and contingencies" within item 8 of this form 10-k for further discussion of these and other government matters.

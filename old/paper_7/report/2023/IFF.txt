overview company background on february 1, 2021, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries merged with and into the n&b business (the "merger"), pursuant to a merger agreement with dupont. the shares issued in the merger represented approximately 55.4% of the common stock of iff on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the merger, as of february 1, 2021. the n&b business is an innovation-driven and customer-focused business that provides solutions for the global food and beverage, dietary supplements, home and personal care, energy, animal nutrition and pharma markets. the transaction was made in order to strengthen iff's customer base and market presence, with an enhanced position in the food & beverage, home & personal care and health & wellness markets. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the n&b transaction.
as a result of the n&b transaction, and following our prior 2018 acquisition of frutarom industries ltd., we have expanded our global leadership positions, which now include high-value ingredients and solutions in the food & beverage, home & personal care and health & wellness markets, and across key taste, texture, scent, nutrition, enzymes, cultures, soy proteins, pharmaceutical excipients and probiotics categories.
33
we are organized into four segments: nourish, health & biosciences, scent and pharma solutions. our consolidated financial information for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 reflects the results of n&b for the full twelve months of 2023 and 2022, whereas the year ended december 31, 2021 only reflects the results of n&b for eleven months of 2021.

impairment of goodwill during 2023, we determined that the carrying value of the nourish reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment charge of $2.623 billion in the consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2023.
during 2022, we determined that the carrying value of the health & biosciences reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.250 billion in the consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2022.
see "critical accounting policies and use of estimates" and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. for more detailed information about risks related to impairment of goodwill, refer to item 1a, "risk factors" - "any impairment of our tangible or intangible long-lived assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our profitability."
impact related to the israel-hamas war we maintain operations in israel and, additionally, export products to customers in israel from operations outside the region. we will continue to evaluate the current events and any potential impacts related to this matter, but we do not expect there to be a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.
in 2023, total sales to israeli customers were approximately 1% of total sales.
impact related to the russia-ukraine war we maintain operations in both russia and ukraine and, additionally, export products to customers in russia and ukraine from operations outside the region. in response to the events in ukraine, we have limited the production and supply of ingredients in and to russia to only those that meet the essential needs of people, including food, hygiene and medicine.
34
in 2023, total sales to russian customers were approximately 1% of total sales. in 2022, total sales to russian customers were approximately 2% of total sales.
in 2023 and 2022, total sales to ukrainian customers were both less than 1% of total sales.
we have a reserve of approximately $3 million related to expected credit losses on receivables from customers located in russia and ukraine. during the second quarter of 2022, we also recorded a charge of $120 million related to the impairment of certain long-lived assets in russia. see note 1, note 5 and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
for more detailed information about risks related to the russia-ukraine war and the israel-hamas war, refer to item 1a, "risk factors" - international conflicts (such as the russia-ukraine war and israel-hamas war), geopolitical events, natural disasters, public health crises (such as the covid-19 pandemic), trade wars, terrorist acts, labor strikes, political or economic crises (such as uncertainty related to protracted u.s. federal government funding negotiations), accidents and other events could adversely affect our business and financial results, including by disrupting development, manufacturing, distribution or sale of our products.
impact of covid-19 pandemic on march 11, 2020, the world health organization designated covid-19 as a global pandemic. as a result of disruptions or uncertainty relating to the covid-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased costs, delays or limited availability related to raw materials, strain on shipping and transportation resources, and higher energy prices, which have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our margins and operating results. we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of these potential impacts to our business, consolidated results of operations, segment results, liquidity and capital resources.
for more detailed information about risks related to covid-19 pandemic, refer to item 1a, "risk factors" - international conflicts (such as the russia-ukraine war and israel-hamas war), geopolitical events, natural disasters, public health crises (such as the covid-19 pandemic), trade wars, terrorist acts, labor strikes, political or economic crises (such as uncertainty related to protracted u.s. federal government funding negotiations), accidents and other events could adversely affect our business and financial results, including by disrupting development, manufacturing, distribution or sale of our products.
2023 financial performance overview for a reconciliation between reported and adjusted figures, please refer to the "non-gaap financial measures" section.
sales sales in 2023 decreased $961 million, or 8% on a reported basis, to $11.479 billion compared to $12.440 billion in the 2022 period. on a currency neutral basis, sales in 2023 decreased 6% compared to the 2022 period. exchange rate variations had an unfavorable impact on net sales in 2023 of 2%. the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region, depending upon the mix of sales priced in u.s. dollars as compared to other currencies. in addition, the decrease in sales was primarily driven by volume decreases across various businesses and the net impact of the divestitures of the microbial control business unit, the portion of the savory solutions business, and flavor specialty ingredients ("fsi") business and the acquisition of health wright products, inc. (collectively, the "net impact of the change in business portfolio mix"), which was approximately $572 million, offset in part by price increases across all businesses.
our 25 largest customers accounted for approximately 32% of total sales in 2023. in 2023, no customer accounted for more than 10% of sales. a key factor for commercial success is our inclusion on strategic customers' core supplier lists, which provides opportunities to expand and win new business. we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers.
gross profit gross profit in 2023 decreased $470 million, or 11% on a reported basis, to $3.681 billion (32.1% of sales) compared to $4.151 billion (33.4% of sales) in the 2022 period. the decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by volume decreases, the net impact of the change in business portfolio mix and unfavorable manufacturing absorption primarily related to our inventory reduction program, offset in part by favorable net pricing and productivity gains.

health & biosciences health & biosciences sales in 2023 decreased $258 million, or 11% on a reported basis, to $2.081 billion compared to $2.339 billion in the 2022 period. on a currency neutral basis, health & biosciences sales decreased 10% in 2023 compared to the 2022 period as exchange rate variations had an unfavorable impact. in addition, performance in the health & biosciences operating segment was driven by the net impact of the divestiture of the microbial control business unit and acquisition of health wright products, inc., which was approximately $228 million, and volume decreases across various business units, offset in part by price increases across all business units.
scent scent sales in 2023 increased $92 million, or 4% on a reported basis, to $2.393 billion compared to $2.301 billion in the 2022 period. on a currency neutral basis, scent sales increased 6% in 2023 compared to the 2022 period as exchange rate variations had an unfavorable impact. in addition, performance in the scent operating segment was driven by price increases, primarily in fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients, and volume increases, offset in part by the divestiture of the fsi business, with an impact of approximately $34 million.
pharma solutions pharma solutions sales in 2023 decreased $26 million, or 3% on a reported basis, to $945 million compared to $971 million in the 2022 period. on a currency neutral basis, pharma solutions sales also decreased 3% in 2023 compared to the 2022 period as the impact of exchange rate variations was flat. in addition, performance in the pharma solutions operating segment was driven by volume decreases, offset in part by price increases.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold decreased $491 million to $7.798 billion (67.9% of sales) in 2023 compared to $8.289 billion (66.6% of sales) in 2022. the decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by volume decreases in sales and the net impact of the change in business portfolio mix, which was approximately $405 million, offset in part by unfavorable manufacturing absorption primarily related to our inventory reduction program and a write-down of inventory related to locust bean kernel ("lbk") in nourish, which was approximately $72 million.
research and development (r&d) expenses r&d expenses increased $33 million to $636 million (5.5% of sales) in 2023 compared to $603 million (4.8% of sales) in 2022. the increase in r&d expenses was primarily driven by higher operating expenses for r&d related activities, offset in part by the net impact of the change in business portfolio mix.
37
selling and administrative (s&a) expenses s&a expenses increased $19 million to $1.787 billion (15.6% of sales) in 2023 compared to $1.768 billion (14.2% of sales) in 2022. the increase in s&a expenses was primarily driven by higher operating expenses for s&a related activities and legal fees incurred for the ongoing investigations of the fragrance businesses, offset in part by lower professional fees, including consulting costs, and the net impact of the change in business portfolio mix.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges increased to $68 million in 2023 compared to $12 million in 2022. the increase was driven by higher severance costs incurred as part of the 2023 restructuring program, net of reversals of prior severance cost accruals. see note 2 for additional information.
amortization of acquisition-related intangibles amortization expenses decreased to $680 million in 2023 compared to $727 million in 2022. the decrease in amortization expense was primarily driven by the reduction in intangible assets as a result of the divestitures of the microbial control business unit in 2022, the portion of the savory solutions business and fsi business in 2023, an impairment of intangible assets of an asset group that operates primarily in russia during 2022 and intangible assets of the portion of the savory solutions business, fsi business and cosmetic ingredients business being classified as "held for sale," and therefore no longer recognizing amortization expense on those intangible assets. the portion of the savory solutions business and fsi business were classified as held for sale up until may 31, 2023 and august 1, 2023, respectively, when we completed the divestiture of the businesses (see note 4, note 6 and note 21 for additional information). the decrease in amortization expense was offset in part by the impact of acquisitions of intangible assets from health wright products, inc.
impairment of goodwill the impairment of goodwill was $2.623 billion in 2023 compared to $2.250 billion in 2022, which was related to the nourish and health & biosciences reporting units, respectively. see note 1 and note 6 for additional information.
impairment of long-lived assets there was no impairment of long-lived assets in 2023. impairment of long-lived assets was $120 million in 2022. the impairment charge was due to the uncertainties related to our operations in russia and ukraine and was allocated on a pro rata basis to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. see note 1, note 5 and note 6 for additional information.
interest expense interest expense increased $44 million to $380 million in 2023 compared to $336 million in 2022. the increase in interest expense was due to higher interest rates on our cash pooling arrangements, commercial paper borrowings, outstanding term loan facilities (see note 9 for additional information) and factoring programs (see note 1 for additional information).
other expense (income), net other expense (income), net, decreased $65 million to an expense of $28 million in 2023 compared to income of $37 million in 2022. the change was primarily due to higher foreign exchange losses and losses incurred from business divestitures, such as the liquidation of a business in russia for the sale of the portion of the savory solutions business and divestitures of the portion of the savory solutions business and fsi business (see note 4 for additional information), compared to gains incurred from the divestiture of the microbial control business unit in 2022, offset in part by the gain resulting from the completion of the china facility relocation (see note 19 for additional information) and higher pension-related benefits.
income taxes the effective tax rate in 2023 was (1.8)% compared to (14.7)% in 2022. the year-over-year change was primarily driven by book to tax differences related to impairment of goodwill, lower tax charges on business divestitures and the recognition of a deferred tax benefit related to an internal restructuring.
segment adjusted operating ebitda results by business unit we use segment adjusted operating ebitda for internal reporting and performance measurement purposes. segment adjusted operating ebitda is defined as (loss) income before taxes before depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, restructuring and other charges and certain items that are not related to recurring operations. our determination of reportable segments was made on the basis of our strategic priorities within each segment and corresponds to the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews and evaluates operating performance to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment. in addition to our strategic priorities, segment reporting is also based on differences in the products and services we provide.

2022 in comparison to 2021
for a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, see "part ii, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022, filed with the sec on february 27, 2023.
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $729 million, inclusive of $26 million currently in assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets, at december 31, 2023 compared to $535 million, inclusive of $52 million in assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets, at december 31, 2022 and of this balance, a portion was held outside the united states. cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are, in most circumstances, available to be repatriated to the united states.
effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our strategy. we regularly repatriate cash from our non-u.s. subsidiaries to fund financial obligations in the u.s. as we repatriate these funds to the u.s. we will be required to pay income taxes in certain u.s. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes during the period when such repatriation occurs. accordingly, as of december 31, 2023, we had a deferred tax liability of approximately $155 million for the effect of repatriating the funds to the u.s., attributable to various non-u.s. subsidiaries. there is no deferred tax liability associated with non-u.s. subsidiaries where we intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings to fund local operations and/or capital projects.
cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities in 2023 were $1.439 billion, or 12.5% of sales, compared to $397 million, or 3.2% of sales, in 2022 and $1.437 billion, or 12.3% of sales, in 2021. the increase in cash flows from operating activities from 2022 to 2023 was primarily driven by the decrease in working capital, largely related to inventories and accounts receivable, offset in part by lower cash earnings, excluding the impact of non-cash adjustments. the decrease in cash flows from operating activities from 2021 to 2022 was primarily driven by the increase in working capital, largely related to inventories and accounts payable.
cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities cash flows provided by investing activities in 2023 were $574 million compared to $745 million in 2022 and cash flows used in investing activities of $18 million in 2021. the decrease in cash flows from investing activities from 2022 to 2023 was primarily driven by the net impact of the change in net proceeds received from business divestitures and unwinding of derivative instruments, offset by the change in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received and higher proceeds from disposal of assets. the increase in cash flows from investing activities from 2021 to 2022 was primarily driven by the change in net proceeds received from business divestiture and unwinding of derivative instruments, offset in part by the change in cash provided by the merger with n&b, higher spending on property, plant and equipment and cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received in 2022.
we have evaluated and re-prioritized our capital projects and expect that capital spending in 2024 will be approximately 4.9% of sales (net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities).
cash flows used in financing activities cash flows used in financing activities in 2023 were $1.851 billion compared to $1.229 billion and $1.304 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase in cash flows used in financing activities from 2022 to 2023 was primarily driven by higher repayments of long-term and short-term debts, compared to lower net repayments of long-term and short-term debts in 2022, and higher net repayments of commercial paper. the decrease in cash flows used in financing activities from 2021 to 2022 was primarily driven by lower repayments of long-term debt and an increase in revolving credit facility and short-term borrowings, offset in part by net repayments of commercial paper, compared to proceeds from issuance of commercial paper in 2021, higher cash dividend payments and higher purchases of redeemable non-controlling interests.
40
we paid dividends totaling $826 million, $810 million and $667 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the cash dividend declared per share in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $3.24, $3.20 and $3.12, respectively.
our capital allocation strategy is primarily focused on debt repayment to maintain our investment grade rating. we will also prioritize capital investment in our businesses to support the strategic long-term plans. we are also committed to maintaining our history of paying a dividend to investors determined by our board of directors at its discretion based on various factors.
capital resources operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs, dividends paid to shareholders and debt service repayments. we anticipate that cash flows from operations, cash proceeds generated from planned business divestitures and availability under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs, including our debt service requirements. we regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long-term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios. see note 9 for additional information.
transaction with nutrition & biosciences, inc.
on february 1, 2021, the n&b term loan facility was funded, which provided for a senior unsecured term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.250 billion, comprised of a $625 million three-year tranche ("2024 term loan facility") and a $625 million five-year tranche ("2026 term loan facility"). following the merger, we assumed the indebtedness incurred by n&b in the debt financings, which included (i) the 2024 term loan facility and 2026 term loan facility and (ii) a series of senior notes in the aggregate amount of $6.250 billion with maturities ranging from 2 to 30 years. n&b's indebtedness raised prior to the merger was used to finance the special cash payment (as defined below) to dupont, which has been paid, and for the satisfaction of the related transaction fees and expenses. see note 3 and note 9 for additional information.
in connection with the n&b transaction, a wholly owned subsidiary of iff merged with and into n&b in exchange for 141,740,461 shares of iff common stock, par value $0.125 per share ("iff common stock"), which had been approved in the special shareholder meeting that occurred on august 27, 2020 where iff shareholders voted to approve the issuance of shares of iff common stock in connection with the n&b transaction pursuant to the merger agreement. in connection with the n&b transaction, dupont received a one-time $7.359 billion special cash payment (the "special cash payment"). the shares issued in the merger represented approximately 55.4% of the common stock of iff on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the merger, as of february 1, 2021. see note 3 for additional information.
term loans and revolving credit facility our credit agreements contain various covenants, limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers, including the requirement for us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to credit adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12-month period. on march 23, 2023, we entered into term loan amendment no. 3, term loan amendment no. 4, revolver amendment no. 2 and revolver amendment no. 3. on september 19, 2023, we entered into term loan amendment no. 5 and revolver amendment no. 4.
term loan amendment no. 3 and revolver amendment no. 2, among other things, extended the period during which certain relief was provided with respect to the financial covenant contained in the existing term loan credit agreement and the existing revolving credit agreement, respectively, which have been superseded by term loan amendment no. 5 and revolver amendment no. 4, respectively.
additionally, the reference rate for u.s. dollar-denominated loans was updated from libor to term sofr. from march 23, 2023, the term loans and revolving credit facility now bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to term sofr plus an adjustment of 0.10% per annum or, in the case of euro-denominated loans, the euro interbank offered rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on our public debt rating. loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.
term loan amendment no. 5 and revolver amendment no. 4, among other things, extend the period during which a term loan covenant relief period and revolver covenant relief period are provided with respect to the financial covenant contained in the existing term loan credit agreement and the existing revolving credit agreement, respectively, through december 31, 2025, or such earlier date on which the company elects to terminate such period, by providing that during the term loan covenant relief period and revolver covenant relief period, our consolidated leverage ratio shall not exceed as of the end of the fiscal quarter for the period of the four fiscal quarters then ended: (i) 5.25x for any fiscal quarter ending on or before march 31, 2024, (ii) 4.75x for the fiscal quarter ending june 30, 2024, (iii) 4.50x for the fiscal quarter ending september 30, 2024, (iv) 4.25x for any subsequent fiscal quarter ending on or before march 31, 2025, (v) 4.00x for any subsequent fiscal quarter ending on or before september 30, 2025 and (vi) 3.75x for the fiscal quarter ending december 31, 2025.
41
during the term loan covenant relief period and the revolver covenant relief period, the amendments prohibit us from (i) effecting share repurchases, (ii) declaring and paying dividends in cash on common stock in excess of $0.81 per share per fiscal quarter (for an aggregate amount of $3.24 per fiscal year) and (iii) creating liens to secure debt in excess of the greater of $300 million and 3.65% of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the term loan credit agreement and revolving credit agreement), in each case subject to certain exceptions set forth therein. see note 9 for additional information on the amendments to the credit agreements.
as of december 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under our $2.000 billion revolving credit facility. the amount that we are able to draw down under the revolving credit facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below. as of december 31, 2023, our borrowing capacity was approximately $1.548 billion under the revolving credit facility.
see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our credit agreements.
debt covenants at december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit agreements, including the net debt to credit adjusted ebitda(1) ratio. at december 31, 2023 our net debt to credit adjusted ebitda(1) ratio was 4.51 to 1.0 as defined by the credit facility agreements, which is below the relevant level provided by our financial covenants of existing outstanding debt. the most comparable gaap measure is the total debt to net loss ratio, which was (3.93) to 1.0 at december 31, 2023.
_______________________
(1)credit adjusted ebitda and net debt, which are non-gaap measures used for these covenants, are calculated in accordance with the definition in the debt agreements. in this context, these measures are used solely to provide information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and may not be comparable to credit adjusted ebitda and net debt used by other companies. reconciliations of credit adjusted ebitda to net loss and net debt to total debt are as follows:

critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. as disclosed in note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. these estimates are based on management's best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future. actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.
those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve:
business combinations from time to time we enter into strategic acquisitions in an effort to better service existing customers and to attain new customers. when we acquire a controlling financial interest in an entity or group of assets that are determined to meet the definition of a business, we apply the acquisition method described in asc topic 805, business combinations. in accordance with gaap, the results of the acquisitions we have completed are reflected in our financial statements from the date of acquisition forward.
we allocate the purchase consideration paid to acquire the business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. if during the measurement period (a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date) we receive additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at the time of the original allocation described above was unknown to us, we make the appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation in the reporting period in which the amounts are determined.
significant judgment is required to estimate the intangibles and fair value of fixed assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. accordingly, we typically engage third-party valuation specialists, who work under the direction of management, to assist in valuing significant tangible and intangible assets acquired.
the fair value estimates are based on available historical information, future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.
we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates, discount rates and profitability), royalty rates used in the relief of royalty method, customer attrition rates, product obsolescence factors, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires significant judgment. all of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., trademarks, product formulas, non-compete agreements and customer relationships) are expected to have finite useful lives. our estimates of the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets are based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the regions in which the brands are sold.
the costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized through expense over their estimated lives. the value of residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment as described in the following note. for acquired intangible assets, the remaining useful life of the trade names and trademarks, product formulas, and customer relationships was estimated at the point at which substantially all of the present value of cumulative cash flows have been earned.
the periodic assessment of potential impairment of goodwill as of december 31, 2023, we have goodwill of approximately $10.635 billion. we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of november 30 every year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded.
44
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components. components within a segment that have similar economic characteristics have been aggregated as a single reporting unit. we determined that we have six reporting units under the nourish, health & biosciences, scent and pharma solutions segments: (1) nourish, (2) fragrance compounds, (3) fragrance ingredients, (4) cosmetic ingredients, (5) health & biosciences and (6) pharma solutions.
for the annual impairment test as of november 30, 2023, we first utilized step 0 of the guidance in asc topic 350, intangibles - goodwill and other, which allows for the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if, based on a review of qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. based on a review of qualitative factors, we determined that for one of the reporting units, cosmetic ingredients, a quantitative (step 1) impairment analysis was not necessary to determine if the carrying values of the reporting unit exceeded its fair values. for the other five reporting units, we determined that a step 1 test was necessary.
we assessed the fair value of the reporting units using an income approach. under the income approach, we determined the fair value by using a discounted cash flow method at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the projected future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value. we used the most current actual and forecasted operating data available. key estimates and assumptions used in these valuations include revenue growth rates, gross margins, adjusted operating ebitda margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates.
in performing the quantitative impairment test, we determined that the fair value of four of the five reporting units exceeded their carrying values and determined that there was no further impairment of goodwill in these reporting units as of november 30, 2023. we determined that the carrying value of the nourish reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment charge of $2.623 billion in the consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2023. the primary drivers of the impairment charge was a decrease in fair value due to declines in projections of the reporting unit, impacts of continued inflation and increases in interest rates. based on the quantitative impairment test performed, we determined that the health & biosciences, fragrance ingredients and pharma solutions reporting units had excess fair value over carrying value of less than 25%. the health & biosciences, fragrance ingredients and pharma solutions reporting units had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 8%, 18% and 8%, respectively. while we believe that the assumptions used in the impairment test were reasonable, changes in key assumptions, including lower revenue growth, operating margin, terminal growth rates or increase in discount rates could result in a future impairment. such charge could have a material effect on our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets.
during 2022, based on the quantitative impairment test using the income approach, we determined that the carrying value of the health & biosciences reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.250 billion in the consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2022.
see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the periodic assessment of potential impairment of long-lived assets we review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered. an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by an asset or group of assets is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. if assets are determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on an estimate of fair value using various valuation techniques, including a discounted estimate of future cash flows.
due to the uncertainties related to our operations in russia and ukraine, we recorded a charge of approximately $120 million related to the impairment of certain long-lived assets in russia in the consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2022. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
new accounting standards see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
non-gaap financial measures we use non-gaap financial measures in this form 10-k, including: (i) currency neutral metrics and (ii) adjusted operating ebitda and adjusted operating ebitda margin. we also provide the non-gaap measure net debt solely for the purpose of providing information on the extent to which the company is in compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements. our non-gaap financial measures are defined below.
45
these non-gaap financial measures are intended to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap. in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period-to-period comparable basis, financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. these non-gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the company's results under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies' calculation of such metrics.
adjusted operating ebitda and adjusted operating ebitda margin exclude depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, other income (expense), net, restructuring and other charges and certain items unrelated to recurring operations such as impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition, divestiture and integration related costs, strategic initiatives costs, regulatory costs, n&b inventory step-up costs and other costs that are not related to recurring operations.
net debt to credit adjusted ebitda is the leverage ratio used in our credit agreement and defined as net debt divided by credit adjusted ebitda. however, as credit adjusted ebitda for these purposes was calculated in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement, it may differ from the calculation used for adjusted operating ebitda.

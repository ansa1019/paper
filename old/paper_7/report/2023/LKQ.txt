overview we are a global distributor of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and specialty aftermarket products and accessories to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles.
buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources: new products produced by oems; new products produced by companies other than the oems, which are referred to as aftermarket products; recycled products obtained from salvage and total loss vehicles; recycled products that have been refurbished; and recycled products that have been remanufactured. we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops, including aftermarket collision and mechanical products; recycled collision and mechanical products; refurbished collision products such as wheels, bumper covers and lights; and remanufactured engines and transmissions. collectively, we refer to the four sources that are not new oem products as alternative parts.
we are organized into four operating segments: wholesale - north america; europe; specialty; and self service, each of which is presented as a reportable segment.
our wholesale - north america segment is a leading provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products, paint and related products, and alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products, with our sales, processing, and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the united states and canada. our europe segment is a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in germany, the u.k., the benelux region, italy, czech republic, austria, slovakia, poland, and various other european countries. our specialty segment is a leading distributor of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories reaching most major markets in the u.s. and canada. our self service segment operates self service retail facilities across the u.s. that sell recycled automotive products from end-of-life-vehicles.
our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. please refer to the factors referred to in special note on forward-looking statements and risk factors above. due to these factors and others, which may be unknown to us at this time, our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate. accordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance.
acquisitions and investments since our inception in 1998, we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. through 2018, our acquisition strategy was focused on consolidation to build scale in fragmented markets across north america and europe. we targeted companies that were market leaders, expanded our geographic presence and enhanced our ability to provide a wide array of vehicle products through our distribution network. in the last few years, we have shifted our focus to acquisitions that target high synergies and/or add critical capabilities, including the acquisition of uni-select, completed in august 2023, that complements our existing north american paint distribution operations and provides a scaled position in the canadian mechanical parts space, with opportunity for future consolidation and growth. additionally, we have made investments in various businesses to advance our strategic objectives. see note 3, "business combinations" and note 11, "equity method investments" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information related to our acquisitions and investments.
sources of revenue we report our revenue in two categories: (i) parts and services and (ii) other. our parts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and specialty products and accessories used to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles. our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of service-type warranties, fees for admission to our self service yards, and diagnostic and repair services. during the year ended december 31, 2023, parts and services revenue represented 95.0% of our consolidated revenue. revenue from other sources includes scrap and other metals (including precious metals - platinum, palladium and rhodium - contained in recycled parts such as catalytic converters) sales, bulk sales to mechanical manufacturers (including cores) and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from our furnace operations. other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold. see note 13, "revenue recognition" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information related to our sources of revenue.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap") requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. historically, we have not made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates as our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates. we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future; however, actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.
critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and which require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. for additional information related to significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, see note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
goodwill impairment description goodwill is obtained through business acquisitions and recorded at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment annually or sooner if events indicate that an impairment may exist. in performing this test, we compare the carrying value of the asset to its fair value. to derive the fair value for our reporting units which carry goodwill, we consider the use of various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach via a discounted cash flow method and another being a market approach via a guideline public company method. if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value, the asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recognized. in performing the test for impairment of goodwill, goodwill is allocated to the reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination.
judgments and uncertainties determining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating fair values as part of impairment testing require significant judgment. estimating the fair values of our reporting units which have goodwill requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. as part of applying the discounted cash flow method and guideline public company method, we use significant assumptions which include sales growth, operating margins, discount rates, perpetual growth rates and valuation multiples which consider our budgets, business plans, economic projections and marketplace data.
sensitivity of estimate to change the balance of our goodwill was $5,600 million and $4,319 million as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively. we have not made material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill during the last three years. the assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends, macroeconomic conditions, and projections consistent with the company's operating strategy. changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses. during fiscal year 2023, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for our goodwill. no impairment charges were recorded as a result of the testing as the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit exceeded the calculated carrying value. a 10% decline in projected cash flows or a 10% increase in the discount rate would not have resulted in an impairment to goodwill.
business combinations description we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, including purchased intangible assets, and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
judgments and uncertainties accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in relation to the acquisitions are appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, information obtained from management of the acquired companies and information obtained from independent third party valuation firms and are inherently uncertain. critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows including revenue growth rate assumptions from product sales and customer contracts, estimated royalty rates used in valuing related intangible assets, customer attrition rates and discount rates. the discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
sensitivity of estimate to change the amount of goodwill recorded from our 2023 acquisitions was $1,221 million as of december 31, 2023. while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. changes in the estimates applied or values of acquired assets and liabilities could have a material impact on our financial statements. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the originally assigned values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.

financial information by geographic area see note 13, "revenue recognition" and note 25, "segment and geographic information" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information related to our revenue and long-lived assets by geographic region.
1 lkq europe plan we have undertaken the 1 lkq europe plan to create structural centralization and standardization of key functions to facilitate the operation of the europe segment as a single business. under this multi-year plan, we expect to recognize the following:
•restructuring expenses - non-recurring costs resulting directly from the implementation of the 1 lkq europe plan from which the business will derive no ongoing benefit. see note 14, "restructuring and transaction related expenses" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further details.
•transformation expenses - period costs incurred to execute the 1 lkq europe plan that are expected to contribute to ongoing benefits to the business (e.g., non-capitalizable implementation costs related to a common erp platform). these expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses.
•transformation capital expenditures - capitalizable costs for long-lived assets, such as software and facilities, that directly relate to the execution of the 1 lkq europe plan.
costs related to the 1 lkq europe plan are reflected in sg&a expenses, restructuring and transaction related expenses and purchases of property, plant and equipment in our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we are executing on the various projects associated with the 1 lkq europe plan and expect to be completed by the end of 2027. in the second quarter of 2023, we extended the completion date from 2025 to 2027 based on a detailed project review, after which we concluded that the common erp system implementation would require additional time to allow for operational process reengineering to support further standardization across the segment. the extended implementation schedule and incremental process reengineering work will help to minimize potential business disruptions but increased the overall cost estimate by $85 million. we expect to achieve additional cost benefits through expanded application of shared services and productivity improvements along with working capital reductions related to inventory rationalization. we are currently realizing a portion of the benefits of the 1 lkq europe plan, and we expect to grow segment ebitda margin in the future as further actions in the plan are implemented. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we incurred $27 million in costs across all three categories noted above. we expect that costs of the plan, reflecting all three categories noted above, will range between $125 million to $155 million for 2024 through the projected plan completion date in 2027. in the future, we may also identify additional initiatives and projects under the 1 lkq europe plan that may result in additional expenditures, although we are currently unable to estimate the range of charges for such potential future initiatives and projects. we expect the plan to continue to enable trade working capital and productivity initiatives that will help fund the plan cost.
ukraine/russia conflict the russian invasion of ukraine and resulting global governmental response impacted our business in 2022 and 2023, and are expected to continue to impact our business in 2024. governmental sanctions imposed on russia have restricted our ability to sell to and collect from customers based in russia and belarus, and russian military activity in ukrainian territory has temporarily changed the way in which we operate in ukraine. many of our branches in ukraine have remained open, although operating at less than full capacity, during the conflict, while others have closed temporarily. we expect to continue operating in this manner unless conditions change. we currently do not expect the conflict to have a material impact on our ongoing results of operations or cash flows. our operations in ukraine represented approximately 1% of both our total annual revenue and total annual operating profit for fiscal year 2023 and comprised approximately $69 million of total assets as of december 31, 2023. in addition, lkq revenue from customers in russia and belarus represented less than 0.3% of our total revenue in 2021 (the last full year before we stopped selling to customers in these countries). as future developments in the conflict are difficult to predict and outside of our control, it is possible that estimates underlying our financial statements may change significantly in future periods.
key performance indicators we believe that organic revenue growth, segment ebitda and free cash flow are key performance indicators for our business. segment ebitda is our key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. free cash flow is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-gaap").
•organic revenue growth - we define organic revenue growth as total revenue growth from continuing operations excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures (i.e., revenue generated from the date of acquisition to the first anniversary of that acquisition, net of reduced revenue due to the disposal of businesses) and foreign currency movements (i.e., impact of translating revenue at different exchange rates). organic revenue growth includes incremental sales from both existing and new (i.e., opened within the last twelve months) locations and is derived from expanding business with existing customers, securing new customers and offering additional products and services. we believe that organic revenue growth is a key performance indicator as this statistic measures our ability to serve and grow our customer base successfully.
•segment ebitda - see note 25, "segment and geographic information" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a description of the calculation of segment ebitda. we believe that segment ebitda provides useful information to evaluate our segment profitability by focusing on the indicators of ongoing operational results.
•free cash flow - we calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property, plant and equipment. free cash flow provides insight into our liquidity and provides useful information to management and investors concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase stock, and pay dividends.
these three key performance indicators are used as targets in determining incentive compensation at various levels of the organization, including senior management. by using these performance measures, we attempt to motivate a balanced approach to the business that rewards growth, profitability and cash flow generation in a manner that enhances our long-term prospects.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
the increase in parts and services revenue of 10.4% represented increases in segment revenue of 18.2% in wholesale - north america, 10.4% in europe, and 2.4% in self service, partially offset by a decrease of 6.9% in specialty. this overall increase was driven by organic parts and services revenue growth of 4.7%, a 4.8% increase due to the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and a 0.9% increase due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. the decrease in other revenue of 19.6% was primarily driven by a decrease in organic revenue of $138 million due to unfavorable movements in precious metals and scrap steel prices compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to a $93 million decrease in our self service segment and a $41 million decrease in our wholesale - north america segment. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in revenue by segment for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased to 59.8% for the year ended december 31, 2023 from 59.2% for the year ended december 31, 2022. cost of goods sold reflects increases of 0.4% from our specialty segment, and 0.3% from our wholesale - north america segment (including a 0.5% dilutive effect related to our acquisition of uni-select), partially offset by a decrease of 0.2% attributable to mix primarily due to a decline in revenue in our specialty segment. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022.
selling, general and administrative expenses our sg&a expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 27.9% for the year ended december 31, 2023 from 27.7% for the year ended december 31, 2022. the year over year change in sg&a expense was mostly impacted by offsetting factors including an unfavorable mix effect, and a reduction in our wholesale - north america segment, which benefited from the uni-select acquisition. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in sg&a expenses as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022.

(1)interest expense increased primarily due to (i) a $63 million increase from higher interest rates for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, (ii) a $58 million increase from higher outstanding debt primarily related to the permanent financing for the uni-select acquisition, (iii) a $9 million increase related to amortization of pre-acquisition bridge loan financing costs related to the uni-select acquisition, and (iv) a $6 million increase from foreign exchange translation, primarily related to an increase in the euro exchange rate.
(2)related to the uni-select acquisition. see note 3, "business combinations" and note 20, "derivative instruments and hedging activities" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
(3)the increase in interest income and other income, net is primarily comprised of (i) a $20 million increase related to interest income, mostly related to the proceeds from the u.s. notes (2028/33) that were invested in money market funds between the bond issuance date and the uni-select acquisition date, (ii) a $5 million increase from funds received to settle an eminent domain matter in 2023, (iii) a $3 million increase related to fair value adjustments for equity investments not accounted for under the equity method compared to the prior year, and (iv) a $2 million increase from the change in foreign currency gains and losses, partially offset by (v) individually insignificant decreases that had a $1 million impact in the aggregate.
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2023 was 24.8%, compared to 25.3% for the year ended december 31, 2022. the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022, is primarily attributable to greater benefits from discrete items in 2023 than 2022. discrete items had favorable effects in both years, with a 2% rate benefit in the current year, mostly related to the uni-select acquisition foreign exchange forward contract gain, and a 1% rate benefit in the prior year, primarily related to the sale of pgw in the second quarter of 2022. unfavorable rate effects in 2023 from non-deductible transaction costs and negative impacts on foreign tax credit availability caused by uni-select related transaction activity partially offset the benefit from discrete items.
see note 24, "income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by $4 million primarily related to an increase in year over year results in an immaterial investment in our wholesale - north america segment.
foreign currency impact we translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period. relative to the rates used for the year ended december 31, 2022, the czech koruna, euro and the pound sterling rate used to translate the 2023 statements of income increased by 5.1%, 2.7% and 0.6%, respectively, while the canadian dollar rate decreased by 3.6%. realized and unrealized currency gains and losses (including the effects of hedge instruments) combined with the translation effect of the change in foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar had a net positive effect of $0.20 on diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2023, mostly related to the $49 million pretax gain on the foreign exchange forward contract related to the uni-select acquisition.
net (loss) income from discontinued operations discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2023 reflected the gsf car parts business, which was acquired with the uni-select acquisition in august and was sold in october. the loss of $6 million represents the net of the operating results prior to the sale and the loss on disposal. income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 of $6 million primarily relates to adjustments to tax reserves on our glass manufacturing business. see note 4, "discontinued operations and divestitures" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on these businesses.
results of operations-segment reporting we have four reportable segments: wholesale - north america; europe; specialty; and self service.
we have presented the growth of our revenue and profitability in our operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. the constant currency presentation, which is a non-gaap measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth and profitability, consistent with how we evaluate our performance, as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational performance. constant currency revenue and segment ebitda results are calculated by translating prior year revenue and segment ebitda in local currency using the current year's currency conversion rate. this non-gaap financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap. our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by other issuers due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. in addition, not all companies that report revenue or profitability on a constant currency basis calculate such measures in the same manner as we do, and accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.

note: in the table above, the percentages of total segment revenue may not recalculate due to rounding.
the key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker, our chief executive officer, is segment ebitda. we use segment ebitda to compare profitability among the segments and evaluate business strategies. segment ebitda includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. corporate general and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue. we calculate segment ebitda as net income attributable to lkq stockholders excluding discontinued operations; depreciation, amortization; interest; gains and losses on debt extinguishment; income tax expense; restructuring and transaction related expenses (which includes restructuring expenses recorded in cost of goods sold); change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; other gains and losses related to acquisitions, equity method investments, or divestitures; equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries; equity investment fair value adjustments; impairment charges; and direct impacts of the ukraine/russia conflict and related sanctions (including provisions for and subsequent adjustments to reserves for asset recoverability and expenditures to support our employees and their families). see note 25, "segment and geographic information" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a reconciliation of total segment ebitda to net income.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)parts and services organic revenue increased 8.2% (8.6% on a per day basis) for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by pricing initiatives which focused on offsetting inflation on input costs and a net volume increase. aftermarket collision parts volumes increased year over year due to reduced pressures on our supply chain. aftermarket collision parts volumes also grew as a result of the continued rollout of state farm's aftermarket parts program, which began on a trial basis in june 2022 and has subsequently been expanded.
(2)other organic revenue decreased 11.8%, or $41 million, year over year primarily related to (i) a $46 million decrease in revenue from precious metals (platinum, palladium, and rhodium) due to lower prices, partially offset by higher volumes, partially offset by (ii) a $5 million increase in revenue from other scrap (e.g., aluminum) and cores due to higher volumes, partially offset by lower prices.
(3)acquisition and divestiture parts and services revenue was a net increase of $432 million, or 10.3%, primarily due to the acquisition of uni-select in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by the divestiture of our pgw aftermarket glass business in the second quarter of 2022. see note 3, "business combinations" and "other divestitures (not classified in discontinued operations)" in note 4, "discontinued operations and divestitures" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the acquisition of uni-select and the divestiture of pgw, respectively.
segment ebitda segment ebitda increased $123 million, or 14.5%, for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, which includes a $46 million positive impact related to the acquisition of uni-select in the third quarter of 2023 (uni-select increases segment ebitda dollars but dilutes the segment ebitda percentage) and a $19 million negative year over year effect related to the pgw business, which we divested in the second quarter of 2022. the remaining increase is primarily attributable to lower freight costs, higher selling prices on parts, improved aftermarket volumes, and productivity initiatives helping to offset inflationary pressures related to product cost. we estimate that precious metals and scrap steel pricing had a net unfavorable effect of $28 million, or 0.4%, on segment ebitda margin relative to the prior year.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)the unfavorable impact related to the acquisition of uni-select in the third quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by (i) a 2.1% decrease in gross margin due to product mix as the paint, body, and equipment and maintenance parts lines have a lower gross margin structure than other wholesale product lines, partially offset by (ii) a favorable impact of 0.9% related to a decrease in overhead expenses as uni-select operates with lower overhead expenses than our other wholesale product lines.
(2)the increase in gross margin of 0.7% was primarily driven by (i) a 0.5% benefit from lower inbound freight costs and (ii) a 0.2% mix benefit resulting from the pgw divestiture in the second quarter of 2022.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)parts and services organic revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by 6.9% (7.4% on a per day basis), primarily driven by pricing initiatives across all geographies to offset increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures and to a lesser extent, higher volumes.
(2)acquisition and divestiture revenue was a net increase of $76 million, or 1.3%, primarily related to our acquisition of seven wholesale businesses from the beginning of 2022 through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition dates.
(3)exchange rates increased our revenue growth by $121 million, or 2.1%, primarily due to the weaker u.s. dollar against the euro, czech koruna and pound sterling for the year ended december 31, 2023 relative to the prior year.
segment ebitda segment ebitda increased $29 million, or 5.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. on a constant currency basis (i.e., excluding the translation impact), segment ebitda increased by $18 million, or 3.0%, compared to the prior year. the increase in dollar terms is attributable to organic revenue growth of $391 million and benefits from productivity initiatives. europe's results were negatively impacted by an $11 million charge to settle a value-added tax issue in italy related to prior years and a loss of revenue and associated margin in our german operations caused by labor strikes, which we estimate resulted in lower segment ebitda of $17 million. refer to the foreign currency impact discussion within the results of operations-consolidated section above for further detail regarding foreign currency impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2023.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)gross margin was flat on a year to date basis, as favorable impacts from price increases were offset by inflationary pressures and difficult macro-economic conditions causing consumer price sensitivity, most notably in our central and eastern european regions.
(2)the increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue primarily reflects the unfavorable impacts of (i) 0.2% due to the settlement of a value-added tax issue in italy and (ii) leverage effects of 0.2% caused by strike activity in germany.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)parts and services organic revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023, decreased by 10.1% primarily due to demand softness in the rv product line, as rv unit retail sales and wholesale shipments have declined year over year.
(2)acquisition and divestiture revenue was a net increase of $64 million, or 3.6%, primarily related to our acquisition of one specialty business in 2023.
segment ebitda segment ebitda decreased $65 million, or 32.7%, for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to the organic revenue decline and the negative effect of inflation on overhead expenses.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)the decrease in gross margin primarily was driven by (i) product channel mix toward lower margin auto and marine products and (ii) increased competitive pricing due to broader availability of inventory among competitors in the market.
(2)segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased despite the negative leverage effect from the 10.1% organic revenue decline. this was primarily due to a 0.2% decrease in personnel costs, mainly driven by decreased workers compensation and health insurance expenses, as well as restructuring activities.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)parts and services organic revenue increased 2.4% for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by pricing initiatives which focused on offsetting inflation on input costs resulting from greater competition for vehicles.
(2)other organic revenue decreased 19.1%, or $93 million, year over year due to (i) a $79 million decrease in revenue from precious metals (platinum, palladium, and rhodium) due to lower prices, (ii) a $20 million decrease in revenue from scrap steel related to lower prices and lower volumes, partially offset by (iii) a $6 million increase in revenue from other scrap (including aluminum) and cores primarily related to higher volumes, partially offset by lower prices.
(3)acquisition and divestiture revenue was a net decrease of $30 million, or 4.2% due to the divestiture of a business in the third quarter of 2022. see "other divestitures (not classified in discontinued operations)" in note 4, "discontinued operations and divestitures" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the divestiture.
segment ebitda segment ebitda decreased $47 million, or 57.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. the decrease is driven by the decline in revenue due to unfavorable movements in commodity prices compared to the prior year and gross margin compression as vehicle procurement costs have decreased at a lesser rate than commodity prices. decreases in precious metals prices contributed an estimated $60 million decline in segment ebitda relative to the year ended december 31, 2022. net sequential changes in scrap steel prices partially offset the impact of the decline in precious metals prices. during the year ended december 31, 2023, scrap steel prices had a $5 million favorable impact on segment ebitda, compared to an $15 million unfavorable impact during the year ended december 31, 2022. the favorable impacts for the year ended december 31, 2023 resulted from the increase in scrap steel prices between the date we purchased a vehicle, which influences the price we pay for a vehicle, and the date we scrapped a vehicle, which influences the price we receive for scrapping a vehicle.

liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions. our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facilities. we utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures, with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions, paying down outstanding debt, paying dividends or repurchasing our common stock. as we have pursued acquisitions as part of our historical growth strategy, our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities. to fund our acquisitions, we have accessed various forms of debt financing, including revolving credit facilities and senior notes. we currently believe we have sufficient access to capital markets to support our future growth objectives.

(1)    interest rate derived via a weighted average we had approximately $976 million available under our revolving credit facilities in place as of december 31, 2023. combined with $299 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2023, we had approximately $1,275 million in available liquidity, a decrease of $298 million from our available liquidity as of december 31, 2022, primarily as a result of reducing our overall revolving credit facility capacity by $650 million after entering into the senior unsecured credit agreement.
the enterprise value for the uni-select acquisition at the time of the acquisition was approximately cad 2.8 billion ($2.1 billion), which was financed with the gross proceeds from the issuance of unsecured senior notes of $1,400 million, senior unsecured term loan agreement ("cad note") of cad 700 million, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand of approximately $150 million and $50 million, respectively.
we believe that our current liquidity, cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods and access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements. however, as noted, we accessed additional financing sources to fund the uni-select transaction. our capital allocation strategy includes spending to support growth driven capital projects, complete synergistic acquisitions, and return stockholder value through the payment of dividends and repurchasing shares of our common stock.
see part ii, item 5 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on a summary of the dividend activity for our common stock for the year ended december 31, 2023.
on february 20, 2024, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock, payable on march 28, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 14, 2024.
we believe that our future cash flow generation will permit us to continue paying dividends in future periods; however, the timing, amount and frequency of such future dividends will be subject to approval by our board, and based on considerations of capital availability, and various other factors, many of which are outside of our control.
with $1,275 million of total liquidity as of december 31, 2023 and $596 million of current maturities, we have access to funds to meet our near term commitments. our current maturities include the 3.875% €500 million euro notes (2024) due april 2024, which we intend to refinance on or before the scheduled maturity. we have a surplus of current assets over current liabilities, which further reduces the risk of short-term cash shortfalls.
our senior unsecured credit agreement and our cad note both include two financial maintenance covenants: a maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio. the terms maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio are specifically calculated per both the senior unsecured credit agreement and cad note, and differ in specified ways from comparable gaap or common usage terms. we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under both our senior unsecured credit agreement and cad note as of december 31, 2023. the required debt covenants per both the senior unsecured credit agreement and cad note and our actual ratios with respect to those covenants are as follows as of december 31, 2023:
covenant level                ratio achieved as of december 31, 2023
maximum total leverage ratio                  4.00 : 1.00                                                   2.3
minimum interest coverage ratio               3.00 : 1.00                                                   7.5
the total leverage ratio increased from 1.5 as of december 31, 2022 as we added debt from the u.s. notes (2028/33) and the cad note in the second and third quarters of 2023. the spread applied to the interest rate on our credit facility borrowings increased in the third quarter and remained the same through the fourth quarter as a result of the total leverage ratio rising above 2.0.
the indentures relating to our u.s. notes and euro notes do not include financial maintenance covenants, and the indentures will not restrict our ability to draw funds under the senior unsecured credit agreement. the indentures do not prohibit amendments to the financial covenants under the senior unsecured credit agreement and cad note as needed.
while we believe that we have adequate capacity under our existing revolving credit facilities to finance our current operations, from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or modification of our existing senior unsecured credit agreement to finance additional investments or to refinance existing debt obligations. there can be no assurance that additional funding, or refinancing of our senior unsecured credit agreement, if needed, will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs. our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
as part of our effort to improve our operating cash flows, we may negotiate payment term extensions with suppliers. these efforts are supported by our supply chain finance programs. see note 18, "supply chain financing" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information related to our supply chain financing arrangements.
we hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings. after giving effect to these contracts outstanding, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured credit agreement was 6.0% at december 31, 2023. including our senior notes and cad note, our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 5.7% at december 31, 2023. under the senior unsecured credit agreement, our borrowings bear interest at secured overnight financing rate (i.e. sofr) plus the applicable spread or other risk-free interest rates that are applicable for the specified currency plus a spread. under the cad note, the interest rate may be (i) a forward-looking term rate based on the canadian dollar offer rate for an interest period chosen by the company of one or three months or (ii) the canadian prime rate (as defined in the cad note), plus in each case a spread based on the company's debt rating and total leverage ratio. see note 19, "long-term obligations" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information related to our borrowings and related interest. the interest rate swaps are described in note 20, "derivative instruments and hedging activities" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and the term loans payable of $1,943 million and $1,786 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. of these amounts, there were no current maturities at december 31, 2023 or 2022.
the scheduled maturities of long-term obligations outstanding at december 31, 2023 are as follows (in millions):

total debt (2)               $4,281
(1)long-term obligations maturing by december 31, 2024 include $16 million of short-term debt that may be extended beyond the current year ending december 31, 2024.
(2)the total debt amounts presented above reflect the gross values to be repaid (excluding debt issuance costs and unamortized bond discount of $30 million as of december 31, 2023).
as of december 31, 2023, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $299 million, of which $232 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. in general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. we believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the u.s. without repatriating our foreign earnings. we may, from time to time, choose to selectively repatriate foreign earnings if doing so supports our financing or liquidity objectives. distributions of dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, if any, would be generally exempt from further u.s. taxation, either as a result of the 100% participation exemption under the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in 2017, or due to the previous taxation of foreign earnings under the transition tax and the global intangible low-taxed income regime ("gilti").
the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds. we normally pay for aftermarket product purchases on standard payment terms or at the time of shipment, depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms. we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles.
the following table sets forth a summary of our aftermarket and manufactured inventory procurement for the years ended december 31, 2023, and 2022 (in millions):

(1)inventory purchases across the wholesale - north america segment increased for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to a $393 million increase attributable to inventory purchases at uni-select from the date of acquisition through december 31, 2023, partially offset by higher purchasing levels in the prior year due to restocking efforts to rebuild inventory levels.
(2)the increase in inventory purchases in our europe segment included an increase of $70 million attributable to the increase in the value of the euro, and to a lesser extent, the pound sterling for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. on a constant currency basis, inventory purchases increased compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased sales and prices for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year.
(3)the decrease in inventory purchases in the specialty segment compared to the prior year was primarily due to matching inventory levels with demand.

wholesale - north america salvage purchases in 2023 increased relative to the prior year due to improved availability of vehicles at auctions. self service salvage purchases in 2023 decreased relative to the prior year due to a focus on reducing car cost as car costs rose faster than commodity prices in late 2022 and early 2023.

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2023              $1,356
(1)    cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases, payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period.
•receivables was a $21 million incremental cash inflow in 2023 primarily at our wholesale - north america and europe segments as a result of collections and timing of sales.
•inventories represented $413 million in incremental cash inflows for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022, including $294 million in our europe segment primarily due to improved inventory management, $93 million in our wholesale - north america segment primarily due to higher purchasing levels in 2022 due to restocking efforts to rebuild inventory levels, and $26 million in our specialty segment inventory due to decreasing inventory purchasing levels to align with softening demand.
•accounts payable produced $274 million in incremental cash outflows for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022 on a consolidated basis. this was primarily attributable to incremental cash outflows in our wholesale - north america segment of $295 million (partly related to accelerated vendor payments in late 2021 to ensure priority access to inventory), partially offset by our specialty segment which contributed a $16 million lower cash outflow. europe was roughly flat primarily attributable to higher payments in 2023, resulting from increased inventory purchases in 2022 that were in accounts payable at the end of december 2022, offset by an increase in its accounts payable under its supply chain financing program, which has longer payment terms.
(2)    primarily reflects the aggregate effect of higher interest payments (primarily due to higher interest rates and additional borrowings for the uni-select acquisition), partially offset by lower cash paid for taxes during the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,442 million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $172 million for the same period of 2022. we invested $2,225 million and $4 million of cash in business acquisitions during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. proceeds from the disposal of businesses were $110 million for the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily related to gsf car parts, compared to $399 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily related to pgw. property, plant and equipment purchases were $358 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to $222 million in the prior year. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we settled our foreign exchange forward contracts related to the uni-select purchase price with the counterparties and received $49 million due primarily to strengthening in the canadian exchange rate relative to the contract rates.

for the year ended december 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $1,102 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1,394 million for the same period of 2022. the increase is primarily due to proceeds (net of unamortized bond discount) of $1,394 million from the issuance of the u.s. notes (2028/33) in 2023, decreases in repurchases of common stock of $1,002 million, and net borrowings of $111 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 (including proceeds from the cad note of $531 million) compared to net repayments on our debt of $48 million for the same period of 2022.
we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers, processing and sales facilities, and warehouses, through further integration of our facilities, and through selected business acquisitions. our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts.
we have various contractual obligations and commitments arising in the normal course of business. the following represent our anticipated material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of december 31, 2023.
•long-term debt of $4,281 million and related interest totaling $1,021 million, of which $596 million and $232 million, respectively, is expected to be paid within twelve months. current maturities include the 3.875% €500 million euro notes (2024) due on april 1, 2024, which we intend to refinance on or before the scheduled maturity. see note 19, "long-term obligations" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information related to debt amounts outstanding at december 31, 2023.

•net pension obligations of $83 million, of which $8 million is expected to be paid within twelve months. benefit payments for our funded plans will be made from plan assets, whereas benefit payments for our unfunded plans are made from cash flows from operating activities. see note 23, "employee benefit plans" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information related to net pension obligations at december 31, 2023.
•self-insurance reserves of $136 million, of which $73 million is expected to be paid within twelve months. see note 7, "self-insurance reserves" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information relates to self-insurance reserves at december 31, 2023.
summarized guarantor financial information on may 24, 2023, we completed an offering of $1,400 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. this offering is guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by certain of our subsidiaries (each, a "subsidiary guarantor" and, together with lkq, the "obligor group"), which are listed in exhibit 22.1 on the company's registration statement on form s-4 filed with the sec on september 1, 2023. the guarantees are full and unconditional, joint and several, and subject to certain conditions for release. see note 19, "long-term obligations" in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information related to this offering.

raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index introduction the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition. this md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. where "nm" is used in various percentage change computations, the computed percentage change has been determined to be not meaningful.
we operate as a financial holding company and bank holding company. results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to general economic conditions and, more specifically, to the direction of the u.s. equity and fixed income markets, changes in interest rates, market volatility, corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends.  overall market conditions, economic, political and regulatory trends, and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control.  these factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants, including investors, borrowers, and competitors, impacting their level of participation in the financial markets. these factors also impact the level of investment banking activity and asset valuations, which ultimately affect our business results.
executive overview year ended september 30, 2023 compared with the year ended september 30, 2022
for the year ended september 30, 2023, we generated net revenues of $11.62 billion and pre-tax income of $2.28 billion, up 6% and 13% compared with the prior year. our net income available to common shareholders of $1.73 billion was 15% higher than the prior year and our earnings per diluted share of $7.97 reflected a 14% increase. our return on common equity ("roce") was 17.7%, compared with 17.0% for the prior year, and our return on tangible common equity ("rotce") was 21.7%(1), compared with 19.8%(1) for the prior year.
the year ended september 30, 2023 included $98 million of net expenses related to acquisitions completed in prior years and the favorable impact of an insurance settlement received during the year related to a previously-settled legal matter. excluding these items, our adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $1.81 billion(1), an increase of 12% compared with the prior year, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share were $8.30(1), an increase of 11%. adjusted roce for the year was 18.4%(1), compared with 18.2%(1) in the prior year, and adjusted rotce was 22.5%(1), compared with 21.1%(1) in the prior year.
the increase in net revenues compared with the prior year was driven by the benefit of significantly higher short-term interest rates in the current year on both net interest income and rjbdp fees from third-party banks, as well as incremental revenues arising from our prior-year acquisitions of charles stanley group plc ("charles stanley"), tristate capital holdings, inc. ("tristate capital"), and sumridge partners. these increases were offset by lower investment banking and brokerage revenues, primarily due to a more challenging market environment during the current year, and a decline in asset management and related administrative fees, primarily attributable to lower pcg client assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of each of the current-year quarterly billing periods.
compensation, commissions and benefits expense was flat with the prior year, as the impact of the decrease in compensable revenues compared with the prior year was offset by incremental expenses arising from our prior-year acquisitions of charles stanley, tristate capital, and sumridge partners, as well as an increase in compensation costs to support our growth and annual salary increases. our compensation ratio was 62.8%, compared with 66.6% for the prior year. excluding acquisition-related compensation expenses, our adjusted compensation ratio was 62.1%(1), compared with 66.1%(1) for the prior year. the decline in the compensation ratio from the prior year primarily resulted from changes in our revenue mix due to higher net interest income and rjbdp fees from third-party banks, which have little associated direct compensation.
(1)    rotce, adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted roce, adjusted rotce, and adjusted compensation ratio are non-gaap financial measures. please see the "reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap financial measures" in this md&a for a reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures, and for other important disclosures.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index non-compensation expenses increased $388 million, or 23%. this increase resulted from multiple items, including elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters during the current year for a number of matters totaling approximately $175 million, a portion of which related to the sec industry sweep on off-platform communications, as well as incremental expenses arising from our prior-year acquisitions of charles stanley, tristate capital, and sumridge partners, and increases in communications and information processing expenses, business development expenses, and the bank loan provision for credit losses. partially offsetting these increases was the aforementioned favorable insurance settlement received. the bank loan provision for credit losses was $132 million for the current year, compared with a provision of $100 million for the prior year, which included an initial provision for credit losses of $26 million on loans acquired as part of the tristate capital acquisition. the bank loan provision for credit losses for the current year primarily reflected the impacts of a weakened macroeconomic outlook for certain loan portfolios, including a weakened outlook for commercial real estate prices compared with the prior year, charge-offs of certain loans, and loan downgrades during the year. these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of loan repayments and sales, which had a larger impact on the current fiscal year expense than provisions on new loans.
our effective income tax rate was 23.7% for fiscal 2023, a decrease from 25.4% for the prior year. the decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to the impact on our provision for income taxes of nontaxable valuation gains associated with our company-owned life insurance policies in the current year compared with nondeductible valuation losses in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in our effective income tax rate arising from nondeductible fines and penalties.
in december 2022, the board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend on common shares to $0.42 per share and authorized common stock repurchases of up to $1.5 billion. during the twelve months ended september 30, 2023, we repurchased 8.35 million shares of our common stock under the board of directors' common stock repurchase authorization for $788 million at an average price of $94 per share. after the effect of those repurchases, $750 million remained under our board of directors' common stock repurchase authorization. we currently expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in fiscal 2024 to offset the impact of shares issued with the acquisition of tristate capital as well as to offset dilution from share-based compensation; however, we will continue to monitor market conditions and other capital needs as we consider these repurchases.
as of september 30, 2023, our tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.9% and total capital ratio of 22.8% were both more than double the regulatory requirement to be considered well-capitalized. we also continued to have substantial liquidity with $2.08 billion(1) of rjf corporate cash as of september 30, 2023, which includes parent cash loaned to rj&a to invest on its behalf. we believe our capital and funding position provide us the opportunity to manage our balance sheet prudently and to continue to be opportunistic and invest in growth. we also have access to significant sources of funding for our business activities should the need arise, including borrowings against the $750 million balance available on our revolving credit facility, which was renewed and increased from $500 million in april 2023, as well as nearly $9.3 billion of fhlb borrowing capacity in the bank segment.
as we look ahead, in spite of our expectation for economic uncertainty in the near term, we believe we are well-positioned for long-term growth, with our strong capital position and total client assets under administration of $1.26 trillion. our financial advisor recruiting activity increased in the latter half of fiscal 2023, and our recruiting pipeline remains strong across our affiliation options. we expect our fiscal first quarter of 2024 asset management and related administrative fee revenues to be negatively impacted by the 2% decrease in fee-based account balances from june 30, 2023 to september 30, 2023, as well as an estimated 5% decline in our combined net interest income and rjbdp fees from third-party banks, reflecting the impact from higher-cost diversified funding sources including our esp, which was launched to pcg clients in march 2023. while we have a healthy investment banking pipeline and saw improvement in investment banking activity in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, we anticipate that market uncertainty may continue to adversely impact the pace and timing of closings early in fiscal 2024, impacting our investment banking revenues. we also expect to continue to experience headwinds for fixed income brokerage revenues due to the decline in cash balances at many of our depository institution clients. finally, although we have proactively taken steps to manage our credit risk in our loan portfolio, including selling approximately $670 million of par value of corporate loans during fiscal 2023, future economic deterioration or changes in our macroeconomic outlook could result in increased bank loan provisions for credit losses in future periods.

raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap financial measures we utilize certain non-gaap financial measures as additional measures to aid in, and enhance, the understanding of our financial results and related measures. these non-gaap financial measures have been separately identified in this document. we believe certain of these non-gaap financial measures provide useful information to management and investors by excluding certain material items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. we utilize these non-gaap financial measures in assessing the financial performance of the business, as they facilitate a comparison of current- and prior-period results. we believe that rotce is meaningful to investors as it facilitates comparisons of our results to the results of other companies. in the following tables, the tax effect of non-gaap adjustments reflects the statutory rate associated with each non-gaap item. these non-gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, our non-gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-gaap financial measures of other companies. the following tables provide a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures.

given the relationship between our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities (primarily held in our pcg, bank, and other segments) and the nature of fees we earn from third-party banks on client cash balances swept to such banks as part of the rjbdp (included in account and service fees), our financial results are sensitive to changes in interest rates. increases in short-term interest rates generally result in an increase in our net earnings, although the magnitude of the impact to our net interest income and net interest margin depends on the yields on interest-earning assets relative to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, including deposit rates paid to clients on their cash balances. our domestic client cash sweep balances continue to represent a relatively low-cost funding source. in fiscal 2023, we introduced the enhanced savings program to our clients and increased our certificates of deposit balances as part of our strategy to diversify our funding sources, albeit at a higher relative cost than other alternatives.
as a result of our diverse funding sources and high concentration of floating-rate assets, we benefited from the increases in short-term interest rates during the second half of fiscal 2022 and continuing into our fiscal 2023, with combined net interest income and rjbdp fees from third-party banks increasing $1.47 billion, or 104%, compared with the prior year. however, despite recent increases in short-term interest rates, our net interest income and net interest margin decreased during the second half of our fiscal 2023 compared with the first half of our fiscal 2023 due to a more rapid increase in deposit costs than in recent periods primarily due to growth in the enhanced savings program.

raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. the following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. the effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year's average rate. similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average rate by the previous year's volume. changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately.

raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index results of operations - private client group through our pcg segment, we provide financial planning, investment advisory and securities transaction services for which we generally charge either asset-based fees (presented in "asset management and related administrative fees") or sales commissions (presented in "brokerage revenues"). we also earn revenues for distribution and related support services performed primarily related to mutual and other funds, as well as fixed and variable annuities and insurance products. asset management and related administrative fees and brokerage revenues in this segment are typically correlated with the level of pcg client aua, including those in fee-based accounts, as well as the overall u.s. equity markets. in periods where equity markets improve, aua and client activity generally increase, thereby having a favorable impact on net revenues. in periods of rising interest rates, we may also see increased interest in fixed income and fixed annuity products.
we also earn servicing fees, such as omnibus and education and marketing support fees, from mutual fund, annuity, and exchange-traded product companies whose products we distribute. servicing fees earned from mutual fund and annuity companies are based on the level of assets, a flat fee or number of positions in such programs. our pcg segment also earns fees from banks to which we sweep clients' cash in the rjbdp, including both third-party banks and our bank segment. such fees, which generally fluctuate based on average balances in the program and short-term interest rates, are included in "account and service fees." see "clients' domestic cash sweep balances" in the "selected key metrics" section for further information about fees earned from the rjbdp.
net interest income in the pcg segment is primarily generated by interest earnings on assets segregated for regulatory purposes and on margin loans provided to clients, less interest paid on client cash balances in the cip. amounts are impacted by client cash balances in the cip and short-term interest rates. higher client cash balances generally lead to increased net interest income, depending on interest rate spreads realized in the cip (i.e., between interest received on assets segregated for regulatory purposes and interest paid on cip balances). for more information on client cash balances, see "clients' domestic cash sweep balances" in the "selected key metrics" section.

pcg aua and pcg assets in fee-based accounts as of september 30, 2023 increased 16% and 17%, respectively, compared with september 30, 2022, due to net equity market appreciation and strong net inflows of client assets during the year, primarily due to the favorable impact of our recruiting. pcg assets in fee-based accounts continued to be a significant percentage of overall pcg aua due to many clients' preference for fee-based alternatives versus transaction-based accounts and, as a result, a significant portion of our pcg revenues is more directly impacted by market movements.
fee-based accounts within our pcg segment are comprised of a wide array of products and programs that we offer our clients. the majority of assets in fee-based accounts within our pcg segment are invested in programs for which our financial advisors provide investment advisory services, either on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. administrative services for such accounts (e.g., record-keeping) are generally performed by our asset management segment and, as a result, a portion of the related revenue is shared with the asset management segment.
we also offer our clients fee-based accounts that are invested in "managed programs" overseen by ams, which is part of our asset management segment. fee-billable assets invested in managed programs are included in both "assets in fee-based accounts" in the preceding table and "financial assets under management" in the asset management segment. revenues related to managed programs are shared by our pcg and asset management segments. the asset management segment receives a higher portion of the revenues related to accounts invested in managed programs, as compared to the portion received for non-managed programs, as it is performing portfolio management services in addition to administrative services.
the vast majority of the revenues we earn from fee-based accounts is recorded in "asset management and related administrative fees" on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. fees received from such accounts are based on the value of client assets in fee-based accounts and vary based on the specific account types in which the client invests and the level of assets in the client relationship. as fees for the majority of such accounts are billed based on balances as of the beginning of the quarter, revenues from fee-based accounts may not be immediately affected by changes in asset values, but rather the impacts are seen in the following quarter.

(1)    includes the impacts of the transfer of one firm with 166 financial advisors previously affiliated as independent contractors to our rcs division during our fiscal third quarter of 2022 and the departure of approximately 60 financial advisors, representing the portion of advisors previously associated through a single relationship in our independent contractors division whose affiliation with the firm ended in the fiscal third quarter of 2023.
the number of financial advisors as of september 30, 2023 increased compared to the prior year, as the number of new recruits and trainees that were moved into production roles exceeded the number of financial advisors who left the firm, including planned retirements where assets are generally retained at the firm pursuant to advisor succession plans. we may experience transfers to our rcs division in fiscal 2024; however, consistent with our experience in fiscal 2023, we would not expect these financial advisor transfers to significantly impact our results of operations. advisors in our rcs division are not included in our financial advisor metric although their client assets are included in pcg aua.

a significant portion of our domestic clients' cash is included in the rjbdp, a multi-bank sweep program in which clients' cash deposits in their accounts are swept into interest-bearing deposit accounts at either raymond james bank or tristate capital bank, which are included in our bank segment, or various third-party banks. such balances swept to third-party banks are not reflected on our consolidated statements of financial condition. our pcg segment earns servicing fees for the administrative services we provide related to our clients' deposits that are swept to such banks as part of the rjbdp. these servicing fees are variable in nature and fluctuate based on client cash balances in the program, as well as the level of short-term interest rates and the interest paid to clients on balances in the rjbdp. under our intersegment policies, the pcg segment receives the greater of a base servicing fee or a net yield equivalent to the average yield that the firm would otherwise receive from third-party banks in the rjbdp. in the current interest-rate environment the pcg segment revenues throughout fiscal 2023 reflect rjbdp fee revenues derived from the yield from third-party banks in the program and the bank segment rjbdp servicing costs reflect such market rate for the deposits. in fiscal 2022, the pcg segment revenues reflected the base servicing fee until may 2022, when the yield from third-party banks first exceeded such level. the fees that the pcg segment earns from the bank segment, as well as the servicing costs incurred on the deposits in the bank segment, are eliminated in consolidation.
the "average yield on rjbdp - third-party banks" in the preceding table is computed by dividing rjbdp fees from third-party banks, which are net of the interest expense paid to clients by the third-party banks, by the average daily rjbdp balance at third-party banks. the average yield on rjbdp - third-party banks increased from the prior year as a result of the significant increases in the fed's short-term benchmark interest rate, which began in march 2022.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index total clients' domestic cash sweep and enhanced savings program balances decreased 16% compared with september 30, 2022, as a result of client cash sorting activity, where clients deploy cash balances in their brokerage account to higher yielding alternatives, driven by the higher short-term interest rate environment throughout fiscal 2023, partially offset by the launch of the enhanced savings program in march 2023, which resulted in $13.59 billion of client cash balances invested in the program as of september 30, 2023. pcg segment results can be impacted not only by changes in the level of client cash balances, but also by the allocation of client cash balances between rjbdp, cip, and the enhanced savings program, as the pcg segment may earn different amounts from each of these client cash destinations, depending on multiple factors.
year ended september 30, 2023 compared with the year ended september 30, 2022
net revenues of $8.65 billion increased 12% and pre-tax income of $1.76 billion increased 71%.
asset management and related administrative fees decreased $165 million, or 4%, primarily due to lower assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of each of the current-year quarterly billing periods compared with the prior-year quarterly billing periods, partially offset by incremental revenues arising from the acquisition of charles stanley.
brokerage revenues decreased $82 million, or 5%, primarily due to lower trailing revenues from mutual fund and annuity products primarily resulting from market-driven declines in asset values for products for which we receive trails, as well as lower sales of equity products, mutual and other fund products, variable annuities, and insurance products. these decreases were partially offset by higher fixed annuity and fixed income product sales.
account and service fees increased $1.03 billion, or 85%, primarily due to an increase in rjbdp fees from both our bank segment and third-party banks resulting from significantly higher short-term interest rates compared with the prior year, partially offset by a decline in average rjbdp balances.
net interest income increased $148 million, or 71%, primarily due to the significant increase in short-term interest rates applicable to our cash, segregated cash, and client margin account balances, partially offset by lower average balances.
other revenues increased $16 million, or 50%, primarily due to a favorable arbitration award during the fiscal third quarter of 2023. the benefit of this award was largely offset by associated compensation expenses and external legal fees incurred over the duration of the claim period, a portion of which was incurred during fiscal 2023.
compensation-related expenses increased $32 million, or 1%, primarily due to an increase in compensation costs to support our growth, annual salary increases, and incremental expenses resulting from our acquisition of charles stanley, partially offset by lower commission expense resulting from lower compensable revenues, including asset management and related administrative fees and brokerage revenues.
non-compensation expenses increased $179 million, or 23%, due to higher provisions for legal and regulatory matters, incremental expenses resulting from our acquisition of charles stanley, higher communications and information processing expenses primarily due to ongoing enhancements of our technology platforms, and increases in travel and event-related expenses compared with the low levels incurred in the prior year.

we provide various investment banking services, including merger & acquisition advisory, and other advisory services, underwriting of public and private equity and debt financing for corporate clients, and public financing activities. revenues from investment banking activities are driven principally by our role in the transaction and the number and sizes of the transactions with which we are involved.
we earn brokerage revenues for the sale of both equity and fixed income products to institutional clients, as well as from our market-making activities in fixed income debt securities. client activity is influenced by a combination of general market activity and our capital markets group's ability to find attractive investment opportunities for clients.  in certain cases, we transact on a principal basis, which involves the purchase of securities from, and the sale of securities to, our clients as well as other dealers who may be purchasing or selling securities for their own account or acting on behalf of their clients.  profits and losses related to this activity are primarily derived from the spreads between bid and ask prices, as well as market trends for the individual securities during the period we hold them. to facilitate such transactions, we carry inventories of financial instruments. in our fixed income businesses, we also enter into interest rate swaps and futures contracts to facilitate client transactions or to actively manage risk exposures.

net revenues of $1.21 billion decreased 33% and we generated a pre-tax loss of $91 million compared with pre-tax income of $415 million in the prior year.
investment banking revenues decreased $449 million, or 42%, compared with a strong prior year, as activity levels were negatively impacted in the current year by macroeconomic uncertainties and significantly higher interest rates, which dampened capital markets activity across the industry. investment banking revenues improved during our fiscal fourth quarter compared to the first three quarters of 2023.
brokerage revenues decreased $115 million, or 19%, primarily due to a decrease in fixed income brokerage revenues resulting from decreased activity from depository institution clients due to challenging market conditions, partially offset by incremental revenues from sumridge partners, which was acquired on july 1, 2022.
compensation-related expenses decreased $163 million, or 15%, primarily due to the decrease in revenues, partially offset by incremental expenses associated with growth investments, including our acquisition of sumridge partners, higher salaries, in part due to inflationary and market compensation pressures, and higher share-based compensation amortization resulting from production-related awards granted in prior years which are amortized over the vesting period.
non-compensation expenses increased $74 million, or 22%, primarily due to incremental expenses associated with sumridge partners, higher provisions for legal and regulatory matters in the current year, and increased travel and event-related expenses and professional fees.

raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index results of operations - asset management our asset management segment earns asset management and related administrative fees for providing asset management, portfolio management and related administrative services to retail and institutional clients. this segment oversees the portion of our fee-based aua invested in "managed programs" for our pcg clients through ams. this segment also provides asset management services through raymond james investment management for certain retail accounts managed on behalf of third-party institutions, institutional accounts, and proprietary mutual funds that we manage, generally using active portfolio management strategies. asset management fees are based on fee-billable assets under management, which are impacted by market fluctuations and net inflows or outflows of assets. rising equity markets have historically had a positive impact on revenues as existing accounts increase in value. conversely, declining markets typically have a negative impact on revenue levels.
our asset management segment also earns administrative fees on certain fee-based assets within pcg that are not overseen by our asset management segment, but for which the segment provides administrative support (e.g., record-keeping). these administrative fees are based on asset balances, which are impacted by market fluctuations and net inflows or outflows of assets.

net revenues of $885 million decreased 3% and pre-tax income of $351 million decreased 9%.
asset management and related administrative fees decreased $36 million, or 4%, driven by lower assets in non-discretionary asset-based programs and financial assets under management at ams at the beginning of each of the current-year quarterly billing periods compared with the prior-year quarterly billing periods, as well as lower average financial assets under management at raymond james investment management (excluding chartwell), in each case primarily due to market-driven depreciation in asset values. these declines were partially offset by incremental revenues of chartwell.
compensation expenses increased $4 million, or 2%, and non-compensation expenses increased $2 million, or 1%, both primarily due to incremental expenses resulting from the chartwell acquisition.

raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index results of operations - bank the bank segment provides various types of loans, including sbl, corporate loans, residential mortgage loans, and tax-exempt loans. our bank segment is active in corporate loan syndications and participations and lending directly to clients. we also provide fdic-insured deposit accounts, including to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, as well as other retail and corporate deposit and liquidity management products and services. our bank segment generates net interest income principally through the interest income earned on loans and an investment portfolio of available-for-sale securities, which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings. our bank segment's net interest income is affected by the levels of interest rates, interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. higher interest-earning asset balances and higher interest rates generally lead to increased net interest income, depending upon spreads realized on interest-bearing liabilities. for more information on average interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability balances and the related interest income and expense, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - net interest analysis" of this form 10-k. for an overview of our bank segment operations, refer to the information presented in "item 1 - business" of this form 10-k. our bank segment results include the results of tristate capital bank since the acquisition date of june 1, 2022. see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for information regarding this acquisition.

year ended september 30, 2023 compared with the year ended september 30, 2022
net revenues of $2.01 billion increased 86%, while pre-tax income of $371 million decreased 3%.
net interest income increased $904 million, or 86%, due to the significant increase in short-term interest rates and higher average interest-earning assets at raymond james bank, primarily bank loans, as well as incremental net interest income from the acquisition of tristate capital bank. these increases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense as we pursue more diversified funding sources which have a higher relative cost, such as the enhanced savings program launched to pcg clients in our second fiscal quarter of 2023 and additional offerings of certificates of deposit. the net interest margin increased to 3.28% from 2.39% for the prior year.
all other revenues increased $25 million, or 81%, primarily due to incremental revenues from the tristate capital bank acquisition largely related to derivatives, valuation gains on certain company-owned life insurance policies compared with losses in the prior year, and higher foreign currency gains compared with the prior year.
the bank loan provision for credit losses was $132 million for the current year, compared with $100 million for the prior year. the bank loan provision for credit losses for the current year primarily reflected the impacts of a weakened macroeconomic outlook for certain loan portfolios, including a weakened outlook for commercial real estate prices compared with the prior year, charge-offs of certain loans, and loan downgrades during the year. these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of loan repayments and sales, which had a larger impact on the current fiscal year expense than provisions on new loans. the provision for credit losses for the prior year reflected the impact of loan growth at raymond james bank and a weaker

raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index economic outlook at that time, as well as an initial provision for credit losses on loans acquired as part of the tristate capital bank acquisition.
compensation expenses increased $93 million, or 111%, primarily due to incremental expenses of tristate capital bank and, to a lesser extent, increased headcount and annual salary increases.
non-compensation expenses, excluding the bank loan provision for credit losses, increased $815 million, or 157%, primarily due to an increase in rjbdp and other fees paid to pcg, and incremental expenses associated with tristate capital bank. rjbdp fees paid to pcg increased $736 million, or 206%, primarily due to a significant increase in short-term interest rates. these bank segment fees and the related revenues earned by the pcg segment are eliminated in consolidation (see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - private client group" for further information about these servicing fees).

non-interest expenses increased $32 million, or 23%, primarily due to a provision in the current year related to the sec industry sweep on off-platform communications. this increase was partially offset by a $32 million insurance settlement received during the current year related to a previously settled legal matter, which was reflected as an offset to other expenses, and a $22 million decrease in acquisition-related expenses.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index year ended september 30, 2022 compared to the year ended september 30, 2021
refer to "item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our 2022 form 10-k for a discussion of our fiscal 2022 results compared to fiscal 2021.
statement of financial condition analysis the assets on our consolidated statements of financial condition consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents, assets segregated for regulatory purposes and restricted cash (primarily segregated for the benefit of clients), receivables including bank loans, financial instruments held either for trading purposes or as investments, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, and other assets.  a significant portion of our assets were liquid in nature, providing us with flexibility in financing our business.
total assets of $78.36 billion as of september 30, 2023 were $2.59 billion, or 3%, less than our total assets as of september 30, 2022. assets segregated for regulatory purposes and restricted cash decreased $5.25 billion, primarily due to a decrease in client cash sweep balances, which resulted in a decline in client cash held in our cip and a corresponding decline in segregated assets. the available-for-sale securities portfolio decreased $704 million as a result of our intention to utilize the cash generated from maturities in this portfolio as a source of funding for our business activities. partially offsetting these decreases was a $3.14 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents as we have increased the cash held in our bank segment since september 30, 2022 as a result of market factors that have impacted the banking industry during fiscal 2023, providing us flexibility to meet the needs of our clients. bank loans, net increased $536 million primarily driven by an increase in residential mortgage loans and cre loans, partially offset by a decrease in c&i loans and sbl.
as of september 30, 2023, our total liabilities of $68.17 billion were $3.35 billion, or 5%, less than our total liabilities as of september 30, 2022, primarily driven by a $6.0 billion decline in brokerage client payables, primarily related to the aforementioned decrease in cip balances as of september 30, 2023. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in bank deposits of $2.84 billion, primarily due to the launch of the esp to pcg clients in march 2023, which raised $13.59 billion of deposits during the year ended september 30, 2023, enabling us to shift a portion of our client cash sweep balances in the rjbdp from being held as bank deposits in our bank segment to third-party banks in our rjbdp, which do not impact our consolidated statements of financial condition. the increase in deposits also allowed us to reduce our already modest level of borrowings from the fhlb by $190 million compared to september 30, 2022, despite the banking market conditions that arose during fiscal 2023.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital are essential to our business. the primary goal of our liquidity management activities is to ensure adequate funding and liquidity to conduct our business over a range of economic and market environments, including times of broader industry or market liquidity stress events, such as those which occurred in the banking industry during fiscal 2023. in times of market stress or uncertainty, we generally maintain higher levels of capital and liquidity, including increased cash levels in our bank segment, to ensure we have adequate funding to support our business and meet our clients' needs. we seek to manage capital levels to support execution of our business strategy, provide financial strength to our subsidiaries, and maintain sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and conservative internal management targets.
liquidity and capital resources are provided primarily through our business operations and financing activities.  our business operations generate substantially all of their own liquidity and funding needs. we have a contingency funding plan which would guide our actions if one or more of our businesses were to experience disruptions from normal funding and liquidity sources. these actions include reallocating client cash balances in the rjbdp from third-party banks to our bank subsidiaries thereby bringing those deposits onto our consolidated statements of financial condition, increasing our fhlb borrowings at our bank subsidiaries, accessing committed and uncommitted lines of credit at the parent or certain operating subsidiaries, accessing capital markets, or in certain circumstances accessing certain borrowings from the federal reserve.
we also have the ability to create additional sources of funding by developing new products to meet the financial needs of our clients. in march 2023 we launched the esp by which pcg clients can deposit cash in a fdic-insured high-yield raymond james bank account. with each of our deposit offerings, we work to obtain sufficient liquidity to support our business operations while also maintaining a high level of fdic insurance coverage for our clients.
our financing activities could also include bank borrowings, collateralized financing arrangements, or additional capital raising activities under our "universal" shelf registration statement. we believe our existing assets, most of which are liquid in nature, raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index together with funds generated from operations and available from committed and uncommitted financing facilities, provide adequate funds for continuing operations at current levels of activity in the short-term. we also believe that we will be able to continue to meet our long-term funding and liquidity requirements due to our strong financial position and ability to access capital from financial markets.
liquidity and capital management senior management establishes our liquidity and capital management frameworks. our liquidity and capital management frameworks are overseen by the rjf asset and liability committee, a senior management committee that develops and executes strategies and policies to manage our liquidity risk and interest rate risk, as well as provides oversight over the firm's investments. our liquidity management framework is designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of funding, even when funding markets experience stress. we manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across products and seek to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets (e.g., the maturities of our available-for-sale securities portfolio). the liquidity management framework includes senior management's review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of necessary expenditures, monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. our decisions on the allocation of resources to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability, cash flow, risk, future liquidity needs, and required capital levels. our treasury department assists in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition and liquidity, and also maintains our relationships with various lenders. the objective of our liquidity management framework is to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient funding and liquidity.
our capital planning and capital risk management processes are governed by the capital planning committee ("cpc"), a senior management committee that provides oversight on our capital planning and ensures that our strategic planning and risk management processes are integrated into the capital planning process. the cpc meets at least quarterly to review key metrics related to the firm's capital, such as debt structure and capital ratios; to analyze potential and emerging risks to capital; to oversee our annual firmwide capital stress test; and to propose capital actions to the board of directors, such as declaring dividends, repurchasing securities, and raising capital. to ensure that we have sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses, the firm adheres to capital risk appetite statements and tolerances set in excess of regulatory minimums, which are established by the cpc and approved by the board of directors. we conduct enterprise-wide capital stress testing to ensure that we maintain adequate capital to adhere to our established tolerances under multiple scenarios, including a stressed scenario.
capital structure common equity (i.e., common stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings) is the primary component of our capital structure. common equity allows for the absorption of losses on an ongoing basis and for the conservation of resources during stress periods, as it provides us with discretion on the amount and timing of dividends and other capital actions. information about our common equity is included in the consolidated statements of financial condition, the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity, and note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k.
under regulatory capital rules applicable to us as a bank holding company, we are required to maintain minimum leverage ratios (defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average assets), as well as minimum ratios of tier 1 capital, common equity tier 1 ("cet1"), and total capital to risk-weighted assets. these capital ratios incorporate quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under the regulatory capital rules and are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings, and other factors. we calculate these ratios in order to assess compliance with both regulatory requirements and internal capital policies. in order to maintain our ability to take certain capital actions, including dividends and common equity repurchases, and to make bonus payments, we must hold a capital conservation buffer above our minimum risk-based capital requirements. see note 24 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for further information about our regulatory capital and related capital ratios.
we have classified all of our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale and have not classified any of our investments in debt securities as held-to-maturity. accordingly, we account for our available-for-sale securities at fair value at each reporting date, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci"). current basel iii rules permit us to make an election to exclude most components of aoci when calculating cet1, tier 1 capital, and total capital. we have elected the aoci opt-out for regulatory capital purposes and therefore exclude certain elements of aoci, including gains/losses on our available-for-sale portfolio, from our capital calculations.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index on july 27, 2023, u.s. banking regulators issued proposed rules that, if enacted, would result in changes to regulations applicable to bank holding companies, including higher capital requirements and eliminating the aoci opt-out election, which could reduce our regulatory capital ratios in the future. under the proposed rule, if enacted, there would be a three-year transition period for the elimination of the aoci opt-out election. we are evaluating these proposals, most of which would apply to us if our average total consolidated assets for four consecutive calendar quarters exceeded $100 billion, to assess their potential impact to our businesses and strategies.
the following table presents the components of rjf's regulatory capital used to calculate the aforementioned regulatory capital ratios.

raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index cash flows cash and cash equivalents (excluding amounts segregated for regulatory purposes and restricted cash) of $9.31 billion at september 30, 2023 increased $3.14 billion compared with september 30, 2022. the increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily resulted from net income earned during the year, proceeds from loan sales, cash resulting from maturities within our available-for-sale securities portfolio, and an increase in bank deposits, as additional deposits from the launch of our esp to pcg clients in march 2023 and additional offerings of certificates of deposit during the year more than offset a decline in rjbdp balances swept to our bank segment. these increases were partially offset by purchases of bank loans, cash used to fund common stock repurchases during the year of $788 million, as well as to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock, and purchases of available-for-sale securities.
sources of liquidity approximately $2.08 billion of our total september 30, 2023 cash and cash equivalents was rjf corporate cash, which included the cash held at the parent company as well as cash it loaned to rj&a. as of september 30, 2023, rjf had loaned $1.39 billion to rj&a (such amount is included in the rj&a cash balance in the following table), which rj&a has invested on behalf of rjf in cash and cash equivalents or otherwise deployed in its normal business activities.
the following table presents our holdings of cash and cash equivalents.

rjf maintained depository accounts at raymond james bank and tristate capital bank totaling $282 million as of september 30, 2023. the portion of this total that was available on demand without restrictions, which amounted to $240 million as of september 30, 2023, is reflected in the rjf cash balance and excluded from raymond james bank's cash balance in the preceding table.
due to market volatility in the banking industry during fiscal 2023, we maintained a higher level of cash balances at raymond james bank and tristate capital bank as of september 30, 2023, a combined increase of $3.3 billion compared with september 30, 2022, as part of our liquidity management strategies.
as of september 30, 2023, a large portion of the cash and cash equivalents balances at our non-u.s subsidiaries, including rj ltd. and charles stanley group limited, was held to meet regulatory requirements and was not available for use by the parent.
in addition to the cash balances described, we have various other potential sources of cash available to the parent company from subsidiaries, as described in the following section.
liquidity available from subsidiaries liquidity is principally available to rjf from rj&a and raymond james bank.
certain of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the uniform net capital rule (rule 15c3-1) under the securities and exchange act of 1934. as a member firm of finra, rj&a is subject to finra's capital requirements, which are substantially the same as rule 15c3-1. rule 15c3-1 provides for an "alternative net capital requirement," which rj&a has elected. regulations require that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $1.5 million or 2% of aggregate debit items arising from client balances. in addition, covenants in rj&a's committed financing facilities require its net capital to be a minimum of 10% of aggregate debit items. at september 30, 2023, rj&a significantly exceeded the raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index minimum regulatory requirements, the covenants in its financing arrangements pertaining to net capital, as well as its internally-targeted net capital tolerances. finra may impose certain restrictions, such as restricting withdrawals of equity capital, if a member firm were to fall below a certain threshold or fail to meet minimum net capital requirements which may result in rj&a limiting dividends it would otherwise remit to rjf. we evaluate regulatory requirements, loan covenants and certain internal tolerances when determining the amount of liquidity available to rjf from rj&a.
raymond james bank may pay dividends to rjf without prior approval of its regulator as long as the dividends do not exceed the sum of its current calendar year and the previous two calendar years' retained net income, and it maintains its targeted regulatory capital ratios.  dividends may be limited to the extent that capital is needed to support balance sheet growth or as part of our liquidity and capital management activities.
although we have liquidity available to us from our other subsidiaries, the available amounts may not be as significant as those previously described and, in certain instances, may be subject to regulatory requirements.
borrowings and financing arrangements financing arrangements we have various financing arrangements in place with third-party lenders that allow us the flexibility to borrow funds on a secured or unsecured basis to meet our liquidity needs. we generally utilize these financing arrangements to finance a portion of our fixed income trading instruments held by rj&a or for cash management purposes. our ability to borrow under these arrangements is dependent upon compliance with the conditions in our various loan agreements and, in the case of secured borrowings, collateral eligibility requirements.
as of september 30, 2023, rjf and rj&a had the ability to borrow under our $750 million credit facility, a committed unsecured line of credit; however, we had no such borrowings outstanding under this facility as of september 30, 2023. see our discussion of the credit facility in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k.
in addition to our credit facility, we have various uncommitted financing arrangements with third-party lenders, which are in the form of secured lines of credit, secured bilateral repurchase agreements, or unsecured lines of credit. our uncommitted secured financing arrangements generally require us to post collateral in excess of the amount borrowed and are generally collateralized by rj&a-owned securities or by securities that we have received as collateral under reverse repurchase agreements (i.e., securities purchased under agreements to resell). as of september 30, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings under two uncommitted secured borrowing arrangements out of a total of 13 uncommitted financing arrangements (nine uncommitted secured and four uncommitted unsecured). however, lenders are under no contractual obligation to lend to us under uncommitted credit facilities.
our borrowings on uncommitted financing arrangements, which were in the form of repurchase agreements in rj&a, were included in "collateralized financings" on our consolidated statements of financial condition. the average daily balance outstanding during the five most recent quarters, the maximum month-end balance outstanding during the quarter and the period-end balances for repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are detailed in the following table.

other borrowings and collateralized financings we had $1.00 billion in fhlb borrowings outstanding at september 30, 2023, comprised of floating-rate and fixed-rate advances. the interest rates on our floating-rate advances are based on sofr. we use interest rate swaps to manage the risk of increases in interest rates associated with the majority of our floating-rate fhlb advances by converting the balances subject to variable interest rates to a fixed interest rate.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index we pledge certain of our bank loans and available-for-sale securities with the fhlb as security for both the repayment of certain borrowings and to secure capacity for additional borrowings as needed. during the year ended september 30, 2023, we increased our borrowing capacity with the fhlb through the pledge of additional available-for-sale securities. at september 30, 2023, we had pledged with the fhlb bank loans and available-for-sale securities of $9.40 billion and $3.66 billion, respectively. as of september 30, 2023, we had an additional $9.25 billion in immediate credit available from the fhlb based on the collateral pledged. further, with the pledge of incremental collateral, we could further increase credit available to us from the fhlb. see notes 7 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information regarding bank loans, net and available-for-sale securities pledged with the fhlb and for further information on our fhlb borrowings, including the related maturities and interest rates.
a portion of our fixed income transactions are cleared through a third-party clearing organization, which provides financing for the purchase of trading instruments to support such transactions. the amount of financing is based on the amount of trading inventory financed, as well as any deposits held at the clearing organization. amounts outstanding under this financing arrangement are collateralized by a portion of our trading inventory and accrue interest based on market rates. while we had borrowings outstanding as of september 30, 2023, the clearing organization is under no contractual obligation to lend to us under this arrangement.
as member banks, raymond james bank and tristate capital bank have access to the federal reserve's discount window and may have access to other lending programs that may be established by the federal reserve in unusual and exigent circumstances, including the bank term funding program that was created by the federal reserve on march 12, 2023; however, we do not view borrowings from the federal reserve as one of our primary sources of funding. see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information regarding bank loans, net pledged with the frb.
at september 30, 2023, we had subordinated notes due 2030 outstanding, with an aggregate principal amount of $98 million. see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information regarding these borrowings.
we may act as an intermediary between broker-dealers and other financial institutions whereby we borrow securities from one counterparty and then lend them to another counterparty. where permitted, we have also loaned securities owned by clients or the firm to broker-dealers and other financial institutions.  we account for each of these types of transactions as collateralized agreements and financings, with the outstanding balance of $180 million as of september 30, 2023 related to the securities loaned included in "collateralized financings" on our consolidated statements of financial condition of this form 10-k. see notes 2 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for more information on our collateralized agreements and financings.
senior notes payable at september 30, 2023, we had aggregate outstanding senior notes payable of $2.04 billion, which, exclusive of any unaccreted premiums or discounts and debt issuance costs, was comprised of $500 million par 4.65% senior notes due 2030, $800 million par 4.95% senior notes due 2046, and $750 million par 3.75% senior notes due 2051. see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information on senior notes payable. at september 30, 2023, estimated future contractual interest payments on our senior notes were approximately $1.9 billion, of which $91 million is payable in fiscal 2024, with the remainder extending through 2051.

should our credit rating be downgraded prior to a public debt offering, it is probable that we would have to offer a higher rate of interest to bond holders.  a downgrade to below investment grade may make a public debt offering difficult to execute on terms we would consider to be favorable.  a downgrade below investment grade could result in the termination of certain derivative contracts and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions. a credit downgrade could damage our reputation and result in certain counterparties limiting their business with us, result in negative comments by analysts, potentially negatively impact investors' and/or clients' perception of us, cause clients to withdraw bank deposits that exceed fdic insurance limits from our bank subsidiaries, and cause a decline in our stock price. none of our borrowing arrangements contains a condition or event of default related to our credit ratings. however, a credit downgrade would result in the firm incurring a higher facility fee on the credit facility, in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on that line as of and subsequent to such downgrade. conversely, an improvement in rjf's current credit rating could have a favorable impact on the facility fee, as well as the interest rate applicable to any borrowings on such line.
other sources and uses of liquidity we have company-owned life insurance policies which are utilized to fund certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans. certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans are employee-directed (i.e., the participant chooses investment portfolio benchmarks) while others are company-directed. of the company-owned life insurance policies which fund these plans, certain policies could be used as a source of liquidity for the firm. those policies against which we could readily borrow had a cash surrender value of $895 million as of september 30, 2023, comprised of $589 million related to employee-directed plans and $306 million related to company-directed plans, and we were able to borrow up to 90%, or $806 million, of the september 30, 2023 total without restriction.  to effect any such borrowing, the underlying investments would be converted to money market investments, therefore requiring us to take market risk related to the employee-directed plans. there were no borrowings outstanding against any of these policies as of september 30, 2023.
on may 12, 2021, we filed a "universal" shelf registration statement with the sec pursuant to which we can issue debt, equity and other capital instruments if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune. subject to certain conditions, this registration statement will be effective through may 12, 2024.

in august 2023, raymond james investment services limited, one of our u.k. subsidiaries, agreed to a voluntary application for imposition of requirements ("vreq") with the fca that prohibits the onboarding of new branches or financial advisors without the prior consent of the fca. we do not expect this vreq to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations.
critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap, which require us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. management has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure the appropriateness of such estimates and assumptions and their consistent application from period to period. for a description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k.
due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. therefore, understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. we believe that of our accounting estimates and assumptions, those described in the following sections involve a high degree of judgment and complexity.

allowance for credit losses we evaluate certain of our financial assets, including bank loans, to estimate an allowance for credit losses based on expected credit losses over a financial asset's lifetime. the remaining life of our financial assets is determined by considering contractual terms and expected prepayments, among other factors. we use multiple methodologies in estimating an allowance for credit losses and our approaches differ by type of financial asset and the risk characteristics within each financial asset type. our estimates are based on ongoing evaluations of our financial assets, the related credit risk characteristics, and the overall economic and environmental conditions affecting the financial assets. our process for determining the allowance for credit losses includes a complex analysis of several quantitative and qualitative factors requiring significant management judgment due to matters that are inherently uncertain. this uncertainty can produce volatility in our allowance for credit losses. in raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index addition, the allowance for credit losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. in such an event, any losses in excess of our allowance would result in a decrease in our net income, as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital.
we generally estimate the allowance for credit losses on bank loans using credit risk models which incorporate relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. after testing the reasonableness of a variety of economic forecast scenarios, each model is run using a single forecast scenario selected for each model. our forecasts incorporate assumptions related to macroeconomic indicators including, but not limited to, u.s. gross domestic product, equity market indices, unemployment rates, and commercial real estate and residential home price indices.
to demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates on our bank loan portfolio to macroeconomic forecasts, we compared our modeled estimates under the base case economic scenario used to estimate the allowance for credit losses as of september 30, 2023 to what our estimate would have been under a downside case scenario and an upside case scenario, without considering any offsetting effects in the qualitative component of our allowance for credit losses as of september 30, 2023. as of september 30, 2023, use of the downside case scenario would have resulted in an increase of approximately $235 million in the quantitative portion of our allowance for credit losses on bank loans, while the use of the upside case scenario would have resulted in a reduction of approximately $50 million in the quantitative portion of our allowance for credit losses on bank loans. these hypothetical outcomes reflect the relative sensitivity of the modeled portion of our allowance estimate to macroeconomic forecasted scenarios but do not consider any potential impact qualitative adjustments could have on the allowance for credit losses in such environments. qualitative adjustments could either increase or decrease modeled loss estimates calculated using an alternative economic scenario assumption. further, such sensitivity calculations do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the related allowance for a number of reasons including: (1) management's predictions of future economic trends and relationships among the scenarios may differ from actual events; and (2) management's application of subjective measures to modeled results through the qualitative portion of the allowance for credit losses when appropriate. the downside case scenario utilized in this hypothetical sensitivity analysis assumes a moderate recession. to the extent macroeconomic conditions worsen beyond those assumed in this downside case scenario, we could incur provisions for credit losses significantly in excess of those estimated in this analysis.

risk management risks are an inherent part of our business and activities. management of risk is critical to our fiscal soundness and profitability. our risk management processes are multi-faceted and require communication, judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets. we have a formal enterprise risk management ("erm") program to assess and review aggregate risks across the firm. our management takes an active role in the erm process, which requires specific administrative and business functions to participate in the identification, assessment, monitoring and control of various risks.
the principal risks related to our business activities are market, credit, liquidity, operational, model, and compliance.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index governance our board of directors, including its risk committee and audit committee, oversees the firm's management and mitigation of risk, reinforcing a culture that encourages ethical conduct and risk management throughout the firm.  senior management communicates and reinforces this culture through three lines of risk management and a number of senior-level management committees.  our first line of risk management, which includes all of our businesses, owns its risks and is responsible for identifying, mitigating, and escalating risks arising from its day-to-day activities.  the second line of risk management, which includes compliance and risk management, advises our client-facing businesses and other first-line functions in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risk. the second line of risk management tests and monitors the effectiveness of controls, as deemed necessary, and escalates risks when appropriate to senior management and the board of directors.  the third line of risk management, internal audit, independently reviews activities conducted by the previous lines of risk management to assess their management and mitigation of risk, providing additional assurance to the board of directors and senior management, with a view toward enhancing our oversight, management, and mitigation of risk. our legal department provides legal advice and guidance to each of these three lines of risk management.
market risk market risk is our risk of loss resulting from the impact of changes in market prices on our trading inventory, derivatives, and investment positions. we have exposure to market risk primarily through our broker-dealer trading operations and our banking operations. through our broker-dealer subsidiaries, we trade debt obligations and equity securities and maintain trading inventories to ensure availability of securities to facilitate client transactions. inventory levels may fluctuate daily as a result of client demand. we also hold investments within our available-for-sale securities portfolio, and from time to time may hold small business administration loan securitizations not yet sold. our primary market risks relate to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign exchange rates. interest rate risk results from changes in levels of interest rates, the volatility of interest rates, mortgage prepayment speeds, and credit spreads. equity risk results from changes in prices of equity securities. foreign exchange risk results from changes in spot prices, forward prices, and volatility of foreign exchange rates. see notes 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for fair value and other information regarding our trading inventories, available-for-sale securities, and derivative instruments.
we regularly enter into underwriting commitments and, as a result, we may be subject to market risk on any unsold securities issued in the offerings to which we are committed. risk exposure is controlled by limiting our participation, the transaction size, or through the syndication process.
the market risk management department is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting market risks associated with the firm's trading and derivative portfolios. while market risk management maintains ongoing communication with the revenue-generating business units, it is independent of such units.
interest rate risk trading activities we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our trading inventory (primarily comprised of fixed income instruments) in our capital markets segment. changes in the value of our trading inventory may result from fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, macroeconomic factors, investor expectations or risk appetites, liquidity, as well as dynamic relationships between these factors. we actively manage interest rate risk arising from our fixed income trading inventory through the use of hedging strategies utilizing u.s. treasuries, exchange traded funds, futures contracts, liquid spread products, and derivatives.
our primary method for controlling risks within trading inventories is through the use of dollar-based and exposure-based limits. a hierarchy of limits exists at multiple levels, including firm, business unit, desk (e.g., for equities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds), product sub-type (e.g., below-investment-grade positions) and issuer concentration. for derivative positions, which are primarily comprised of interest rate swaps, we have established sensitivity-based and foreign exchange spot limits. trading positions and derivatives are monitored against these limits through daily reports that are distributed to senior management. during volatile markets, we may temporarily reduce limits and/or choose to pare our trading inventories to reduce risk.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index we monitor value-at-risk ("var") for all of our trading portfolios on a daily basis for risk management purposes and as a result of applying the fed's market risk rule ("mrr") for the purpose of calculating our capital ratios. the mrr, also known as the "risk-based capital guidelines: market risk" rule released by the fed, the occ, and the fdic, requires us to calculate var for all of our trading portfolios, including fixed income, equity, derivatives, and foreign exchange instruments. var is an appropriate statistical technique for estimating potential losses in trading portfolios due to typical adverse market movements over a specified time horizon with a suitable confidence level.  however, there are inherent limitations to utilizing var including: historical movements in markets may not accurately predict future market movements; var does not take into account the liquidity of individual positions; var does not estimate losses over longer time horizons; and extended periods of one-directional markets potentially distort risks within the portfolio. in addition, should markets become more volatile, actual trading losses may exceed var results presented on a single day and might accumulate over a longer time horizon. as a result, management complements var with sensitivity analysis and stress testing and employs additional controls such as a daily review of trading results, review of aged inventory, independent review of pricing, monitoring of concentrations, and review of issuer ratings.
to calculate var, we use models that incorporate historical simulation. this approach assumes that historical changes in market conditions, such as in interest rates and equity prices, are representative of future changes. simulation is based on daily market data for the previous twelve months. var is reported at a 99% confidence level for a one-day time horizon. assuming that future market conditions change as they have in the past twelve months, we would expect to incur losses greater than those predicted by our one-day var estimates about once every 100 trading days, or about three times per year on average. the var model is independently reviewed by our model risk management function. see the "model risk" section that follows for further information.
the modeling of the risk characteristics of trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations that management believes to be reasonable. however, there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating var, and different assumptions or approximations could produce materially different var estimates. as a result, var results are more reliable when used as indicators of risk levels and trends within a firm than as a basis for inferring differences in risk-taking across firms.
the following table sets forth the high, low, period-end and average daily one-day var for all of our trading portfolios, including fixed income and equity instruments, and for our derivatives for the periods and dates indicated.

average daily var was higher during the year ended september 30, 2023 compared with the year ended september 30, 2022 due to the impact of increased market volatility during the year, as well as the addition of the sumridge partners trading inventory beginning in july 2022.
the fed's mrr requires us to perform daily back-testing procedures for our var model, whereby we compare each day's projected var to its regulatory-defined daily trading losses, which exclude fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading. regulatory-defined daily trading losses are used to evaluate the performance of our var model and are not comparable to our actual daily net revenues. based on these daily "ex ante" versus "ex post" comparisons, we determine whether the number of times that regulatory-defined daily trading losses exceed var is consistent with our expectations at a 99% confidence level. during the year ended september 30, 2023, our regulatory-defined daily losses in our trading portfolios exceeded our predicted var on three occasions in line with our previously described expectations.
separately, rjf provides additional market risk disclosures to comply with the mrr, including 10-day var and 10-day stressed var, which are available on our website at https://www.raymondjames.com/investor-relations/financial-information/filings-and-reports within "other reports and information."

raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index banking operations our bank segment maintains an interest-earning asset portfolio that is comprised of cash, sbl, c&i loans, cre loans, reit loans, residential mortgage loans, and tax-exempt loans, as well as securities held in the available-for-sale securities portfolio.  these interest-earning assets are primarily funded by client deposits.  based on the current asset portfolio, our banking operations are subject to interest rate risk. we analyze interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income, which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid, and the net portfolio valuation, both across a range of interest rate scenarios.
one of the objectives of our asset and liability committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates. this committee uses several measures to monitor and limit interest rate risk in our banking operations, including scenario analysis and economic value of equity ("eve"). we utilize hedging strategies using interest rate swaps in our banking operations as a component of our asset and liability management process. for further information regarding this hedging strategy, see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k. we also manage interest rate risk as part of our liquidity management framework. see "item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources" of this form 10-k for further information.
to ensure that we remain within the tolerances established for net interest income, a sensitivity analysis of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated under a variety of scenarios. we use simulation models and estimation techniques to assess the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates. the model estimates the sensitivity by calculating interest income and interest expense in a dynamic balance sheet environment using current repricing, prepayment, and reinvestment of cash flow assumptions over a 12-month time horizon. assumptions used in the model include interest rate movement, the slope of the yield curve, and balance sheet composition and growth. the model also considers interest rate-related risks such as pricing spreads, pricing of client cash accounts, including deposit betas, and prepayments. various interest rate scenarios are modeled in order to determine the effect those scenarios may have on net interest income.
the following table is an analysis of our banking operations' estimated net interest income over a 12-month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates (expressed in basis points) using our previously described asset/liability model, which assumes a dynamic balance sheet, a weighted average deposit beta on our interest-bearing deposit accounts without stated maturities of approximately 50% as interest rates rise and approximately 40% as interest rates fall, and that interest rates do not decline below zero. while not presented, additional rate scenarios are performed, including interest rate ramps and yield curve shifts that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements. we also perform simulations on time horizons of up to five years to assess longer-term impacts to various interest rate scenarios. on a quarterly basis, we test expected model results to actual performance. additionally, any changes made to key assumptions in the model are documented and approved by the asset and liability committee.

we have classified all of our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale and have not classified any of our investments in debt securities as held-to-maturity. in our available-for-sale securities portfolio, we hold primarily fixed-rate agency-backed mbs, agency-backed cmos, and u.s. treasuries, which are carried at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial condition, with changes in the fair value of the portfolio recorded through other comprehensive income ("oci") on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. as the majority of our available-for-sale securities portfolio is comprised of u.s. government and government agency-backed securities, changes in fair value are primarily driven by changes

raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index in interest rates. at september 30, 2023, our available-for-sale securities portfolio had a fair value of $9.18 billion with a weighted-average yield of 2.11% and a weighted-average life, after factoring in estimated prepayments, of 4.2 years. to evaluate the interest rate sensitivity of our available-for-sale securities portfolio we also monitor, among other things, effective duration, defined as the approximate percentage change in price for a 100-basis point change in rates. as of september 30, 2023, the effective duration of our available-for-sale securities portfolio was approximately 3.56, which means that we would expect the market value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio to decline approximately 3.56% for every 100-basis point increase in interest rates and increase approximately 3.56% for every 100-basis point decline in interest rates. see notes 2 and 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information on our available-for-sale securities portfolio.
the asset and liability committee also reviews eve, which is a point-in-time analysis of current interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives, discounted at current rates. the eve approach is based on a static balance sheet and provides an indicator of future earnings and capital levels as the changes in eve indicate the anticipated change in the value of future cash flows. we monitor sensitivity to changes in eve utilizing board of directors-approved limits. these limits set a risk tolerance to changing interest rates and assist in determining strategies for mitigating this risk as eve approaches these limits. as of september 30, 2023, our eve analyses were within approved limits.
the following table shows the maturities of our bank loan portfolio at september 30, 2023, including contractual principal repayments.  maturities are generally determined based upon contractual terms; however, rollovers or extensions that are included for the purposes of measuring the allowance for credit losses are reflected in maturities in the following table. this table does not include any estimates of prepayments, which could shorten the average loan lives and cause the actual timing of the loan repayments to differ significantly from those shown in the table.

contractual loan terms for sbl, c&i loans, cre loans, reit loans, and residential mortgage loans may include an interest rate floor, cap and/or fixed interest rates for a certain period of time, which would impact the timing of the interest rate reset for the respective loan. see the discussion within the "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - risk management - credit risk - risk monitoring process" section of this form 10-k for additional information regarding our interest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk as a result of our capital markets activities. our broker-dealer activities are generally client-driven, and we carry equity securities as part of our trading inventory to facilitate such activities, although the amounts are not as significant as our fixed income trading inventory.  we attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions each day and establishing position limits. equity securities held in our trading inventory are generally included in var.
in addition, we have a private equity portfolio, included in "other investments" on our consolidated statements of financial condition, which is primarily comprised of investments in third-party funds. see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information on this portfolio.
foreign exchange risk we are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our investments in foreign subsidiaries as well as transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the usd. for example, our bank loan portfolio includes loans which are denominated in canadian dollars, totaling $1.40 billion and $1.51 billion at september 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, when converted to usd. a majority of such loans are held in a canadian subsidiary of raymond james bank, which is discussed in the following sections.
investments in foreign subsidiaries raymond james bank has an investment in a canadian subsidiary, resulting in foreign exchange risk. to mitigate its foreign exchange risk, raymond james bank utilizes short-term, forward foreign exchange contracts. these derivatives are primarily accounted for as net investment hedges in the consolidated financial statements. see notes 2 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for further information regarding these derivatives.
at september 30, 2023, we had foreign exchange risk in our investment in rj ltd. of cad 418 million and in our investment in charles stanley of £290 million, which were not hedged. at september 30, 2023, we had other, less significant investments in foreign domiciled subsidiaries, primarily in europe, which were not hedged; however, we do not believe we had material foreign exchange risk either individually, or in the aggregate, pertaining to these subsidiaries as of september 30, 2023. foreign exchange gains/losses related to our foreign investments are primarily reflected in oci on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. see note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for further information regarding our components of oci.
transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the usd we are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our holdings of cash and certain other assets and liabilities resulting from transactions denominated in a currency other than the usd. any currency-related gains/losses arising from these foreign currency denominated balances are reflected in "other" revenues in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. the foreign exchange risk associated with a portion of such transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency are mitigated utilizing short-term, forward foreign exchange contracts. such derivatives are not designated hedges and therefore, the related gains/losses are included in "other" revenues in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for information regarding our derivatives.
credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrower's, issuer's, or counterparty's ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreed-upon terms. the nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction, the structure and duration of that transaction, and the parties involved. credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activities.
corporate activities we maintain cash balances with the fed and with various financial institutions, primarily global systemically important financial institutions, in our normal course of business. a large portion of such balances are in excess of fdic insurance limits. as a result, we may be exposed to the risk that these financial institutions may not return our cash to us in the event that the institution experiences financial distress or ceases its operations. in order to mitigate our credit risk to such financial raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index institutions, we monitor our exposure with each institution on a daily basis and subject each institution to limits based on various factors including but not limited to financial strength, capitalization levels, liquidity, credit ratings, and market factors to the extent applicable.
brokerage activities we are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities in which our counterparties primarily include broker-dealers, banks, exchanges, clearing organizations, and other financial institutions. we are exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations.  in addition, certain commitments, including underwritings, may create exposure to individual issuers and businesses. the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty and/or the issuer of the instrument. in addition, we may be subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions in or have large commitments to a single counterparty, borrower, or group of similar counterparties or borrowers (e.g., in the same industry). we seek to mitigate these risks by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty, conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties, reviewing security, derivative and loan concentrations, holding collateral as security for certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations, which may guarantee performance. see notes 2, 6, and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for further information about our credit risk mitigation related to derivatives and collateralized agreements.
our client activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients. client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis. credit exposure results from client margin loans, which are monitored daily and are collateralized by the securities in the clients' accounts. we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities on a daily basis in connection with our margin lending activities. we adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions. in addition, when clients execute a purchase, we are at some risk that the client will default on their financial obligation associated with the trade. if this occurs, we may have to liquidate the position at a loss. see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10‐k for further information about our determination of the allowance for credit losses associated with certain of our brokerage lending activities.
we offer loans to financial advisors for recruiting and retention purposes. we have credit risk and may incur a loss primarily in the event that such borrower is no longer affiliated with us. see notes 2 and 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for further information about our loans to financial advisors.
banking activities our bank segment has a substantial loan portfolio.  our strategy for credit risk management related to bank loans includes well-defined credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all credit exposures. the strategy also includes diversification across loan types, geographic locations, industries and clients, regular credit examinations and management reviews of all corporate and tax-exempt loans as well as individual delinquent residential loans. the credit risk management process also includes independent reviews at least annually of the credit risk monitoring process that performs assessments of compliance with credit policies, risk ratings, and other critical credit information. we seek to identify potential problem loans early, record any necessary risk rating changes and charge-offs promptly, and maintain appropriate reserve levels for expected losses. we utilize a thorough credit risk rating system to measure the credit quality of individual corporate and tax-exempt loans and related unfunded lending commitments. for our residential mortgage loans and substantially all of our sbl, we utilize the credit risk rating system used by bank regulators in measuring the credit quality of each homogeneous class of loans. in evaluating credit risk, we consider trends in loan performance, historical experience through various economic cycles, industry or client concentrations, the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors (both current and forecasted). these factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net charge-offs.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index while our bank loan portfolio is diversified, a significant downturn in the overall economy, deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where we have a concentration will generally result in large provisions for credit losses and/or charge-offs. we determine the allowance required for specific loan pools based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and make enhancements we consider appropriate. our allowance for credit losses methodology is described in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k. as our bank loan portfolio is segregated into six portfolio segments, likewise, the allowance for credit losses is segregated by these same segments.  the risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows.
sbl: loans in this segment are primarily collateralized by the borrower's marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards and, to a lesser extent, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies issued by an investment-grade insurance company. an insignificant portion of our sbl portfolio is collateralized by private securities or other financial instruments with a limited trading market. substantially all sbl are monitored daily for adherence to loan-to-value ("ltv") guidelines and when a loan exceeds the required ltv, a collateral call is issued. past due loans are minimal as any past due amounts result in a notice to the client for payment or the potential sale of the collateral which will bring the loan to a current status. the vast majority of our sbl qualify for the practical expedient allowed under the cecl guidance whereby we estimate zero credit losses to the extent the fair value of the collateral securing the loan equals or exceeds the related carrying value of the loan. sbl also generally qualify for lower capital requirements under regulatory capital rules.
c&i: loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by all assets of the business.  repayment, including for owner-occupied properties, is expected from the cash flows of the respective business.  unfavorable economic and political conditions, including the resultant decrease in consumer or business spending, may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment.
cre: loans in this segment are primarily secured by income-producing properties.  the underlying cash flows generated by properties securing these loans may be adversely affected by increased vacancy and decreases in rental rates, which are monitored on an ongoing basis.  this portfolio segment includes cre construction loans which involve risks such as project budget overruns, performance variables related to the contractor and subcontractors, or the inability to sell the project or secure permanent financing once the project is completed. with respect to commercial construction of residential developments, there is also the risk that the builder has a geographical concentration of developments. adverse information arising from any of these factors may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment.
reit: loans in this segment are made to businesses that own or finance income-producing real estate across various property sectors. this portfolio segment may include extensions of credit to companies that engage in real estate development. repayment of these loans is dependent on income generated from real estate properties or the sale of real estate. a portion of this segment may consist of loans secured by residential product types (single-family residential, including condominiums and land held for residential development) within a range of markets. deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business, reductions in the value of real estate, as well as increased vacancy and decreases in rental rates may all adversely affect the loans in this segment.
residential mortgage (includes home equity loans/lines): all of our residential mortgage loans adhere to stringent underwriting parameters pertaining to credit score and credit history, debt-to-income ratio of the borrower, ltv, and combined ltv (including second mortgage/home equity loans).  we do not originate or purchase adjustable rate mortgage ("arm") loans with negative amortization, reverse mortgages, or loans to subprime borrowers.  loans with deeply discounted teaser rates are also not originated or purchased.  all loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is primarily dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower.  a decline in the strength of the economy, particularly unemployment rates and housing prices, among other factors, could have a significant effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment.
tax-exempt: loans in this segment are made to governmental and non-profit entities and are generally secured by a pledge of revenue and, in some cases, by a security interest in or a mortgage on the asset being financed. for loans to governmental entities, repayment is expected from a pledge of certain revenues or taxes. for non-profit entities, repayment is expected from revenues which may include fundraising proceeds. these loans are subject to demographic risk, therefore much of the credit assessment of tax-exempt loans is driven by the entity's revenue base and the general economic environment. adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index the level of charge-off activity is a factor that is considered in evaluating the potential severity of future credit losses. the following table presents net loan (charge-offs)/recoveries and the percentage of net loan (charge-offs)/recoveries to the average outstanding loan balances by loan portfolio segment.

(1) nonperforming loans at september 30, 2023 and september 30, 2022 included $96 million and $63 million of loans, respectively, which were current pursuant to their contractual terms.
the nonperforming loan balances in the preceding table excluded $7 million as of both september 30, 2023 and 2022 of residential troubled debt restructurings which were returned to accrual status in accordance with our policy.
although our nonperforming assets as a percentage of our bank segment's assets remained low as of september 30, 2023, any prolonged period of market deterioration could result in an increase in our nonperforming assets, an increase in our allowance for credit losses and/or an increase in net charge-offs in future periods, although the extent would depend on future developments that are highly uncertain.

loan underwriting policies a component of our bank segment's credit risk management strategy is conservative, well-defined policies and procedures. our bank segment's underwriting policies for the major types of loans are described in the following sections.
sbl portfolio our sbl portfolio represented 33% of our total loans held for sale and investment as of september 30, 2023. this portfolio is primarily comprised of loans fully collateralized by a borrower's marketable securities and, to a lesser extent, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies issued by an investment-grade insurance company. an insignificant portion of our sbl portfolio is collateralized by private securities or other financial instruments with a limited trading market. the underwriting policy for the sbl portfolio primarily includes a review of collateral, including ltv, and a review of repayment history.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index corporate and tax-exempt loan portfolios our corporate and tax-exempt loan portfolios were comprised of approximately 1,600 borrowers as of september 30, 2023. of these loan portfolios, approximately 80% was comprised of loans to larger companies with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization greater than $100 million, of which approximately 40% were loans to public companies. the remaining 20% was primarily focused on middle-market businesses located within the primary markets of pennsylvania, ohio, new jersey, and new york. we have offices in each of these states led by experienced regional presidents to understand the unique borrowing needs and credit risk of the middle-market businesses in the area. they are supported by highly experienced relationship managers who target middle-market business customers with annual revenues of $10 million to $300 million. our corporate loan portfolio is diversified by geography, by loan type, and among a number of industries in the u.s and canada, and a large portion of these loans are to borrowers in industries in which we have expertise through coverage provided by our capital markets research analysts. our corporate loans include project finance real estate loans, commercial lines of credit, and term loans, the majority of which are participations in shared national credit ("snc") or other large, syndicated loans. we are typically either involved in the syndication of the loans at inception or purchase loans in secondary trading markets. the remainder of the corporate loan portfolio is comprised of smaller participations and direct loans. there are no subordinated loans or mezzanine financings in the corporate loan portfolio. our tax-exempt loans are long-term loans to governmental and non-profit entities. these loans generally have lower overall credit risk but are subject to other risks that are not usually present with corporate clients, including the risk associated with the constituency served by a local government and the risk in ensuring an obligation has appropriate tax treatment.
the majority of our corporate and tax-exempt loan portfolios are underwritten, managed, and reviewed at one of our corporate locations while the remainder are approved by a committee of senior executives, both of which facilitates close monitoring of the portfolio by credit risk personnel, relationship officers, and senior bank executives. all corporate and tax-exempt loans are independently underwritten to our credit policies, are subject to approval by a loan committee, and credit quality is monitored on an ongoing basis by our lending staff. our credit policies include criteria related to ltv limits based upon property type, single borrower loan limits, loan term and structure parameters (including guidance on leverage, debt service coverage ratios and debt repayment ability), industry concentration limits, secondary sources of repayment, municipality demographics, and other criteria. our corporate loans are generally secured by all assets of the borrower and in some instances are secured by mortgages on specific real estate. tax-exempt loans are generally secured by a pledge of revenue. in a limited number of transactions, loans in the portfolio are extended on an unsecured basis. in addition, corporate and tax-exempt loans are subject to regulatory review.
residential mortgage loan portfolio our residential mortgage loan portfolio largely consists of first mortgage loans originated by us via referrals from our pcg financial advisors and the general public, as well as first mortgage loans purchased by us. substantially all of our residential mortgage loans adhere to strict underwriting parameters pertaining to credit score and credit history, debt-to-income ratio of the borrower, ltv and combined ltv (including second mortgage/home equity loans). as of september 30, 2023, approximately 95% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio consisted of owner-occupant borrowers (approximately 74% for their primary residences and 21% for second home residences). approximately 33% of the first lien residential mortgage loans were arm loans, which receive interest-only payments based on a fixed rate for an initial period of the loan, ranging from the first five to fifteen years depending on the loan, and then become fully amortizing, subject to annual and lifetime interest rate caps. a significant portion of our originated 15 or 30-year fixed-rate residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market.
risk monitoring process another component of credit risk strategy for our bank loan portfolio is the ongoing risk monitoring and review processes, including our internal loan review process, as well as our rigorous processes to manage and limit credit losses arising from loan delinquencies.  there are various other factors included in these processes, depending on the loan portfolio.
sbl and residential mortgage loan portfolios substantially all collateral securing our sbl portfolio is monitored on a daily basis. collateral adjustments, as triggered by our monitoring procedures, are made by the borrower as necessary to ensure our loans are adequately secured, resulting in minimizing our credit risk. collateral calls have been minimal relative to our sbl portfolio with insignificant losses incurred during the year ended september 30, 2023.
we track and review many factors to monitor credit risk in our residential mortgage loan portfolio. the factors include, but are not limited to: loan performance trends, loan product parameters and qualification requirements, borrower credit scores, level of raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index documentation, loan purpose, geographic concentrations, average loan size, risk rating, and ltv ratios.  see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information.
the following table presents a summary of delinquent residential mortgage loans, the vast majority of which are first mortgage loans, which are comprised of loans which are two or more payments past due as well as loans in the process of foreclosure.

our september 30, 2023 percentage compares favorably to the national average for over 30 day delinquencies of 1.85%, as most recently reported by the fed.
to manage and limit credit losses, we maintain a rigorous process to manage our loan delinquencies. substantially all of our residential first mortgages are serviced by a third party whereby the primary collection effort resides with the servicer. our personnel direct and actively monitor the servicers' efforts through extensive communications regarding individual loan status changes and through requirements of timely and appropriate collection of property management actions and reporting, including management of third parties used in the collection process (e.g., appraisers, attorneys, etc.). residential mortgage loans over 60 days past due are generally reviewed by our personnel monthly and documented in a written report detailing delinquency information, balances, collection status, appraised value, and other data points. our senior management meets quarterly to discuss the status, collection strategy and charge-off recommendations on substantially all residential mortgage loans over 60 days past due. updated collateral valuations are generally obtained for loans over 90 days past due and charge-offs are typically taken on individual loans based on these valuations generally before the loan is 120 days past due.
credit risk is also managed by diversifying the residential mortgage portfolio. most of the loans in our residential loan portfolio are to pcg clients across the u.s. the following table details the geographic concentrations (top five states) of our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.

the occurrence of a natural disaster or severe weather event in any of these states, for example wildfires in california and hurricanes in florida, could result in additional credit loss provisions and/or charge-offs on our loans in such states and therefore negatively impact our net income and regulatory capital in any given period.
loans where borrowers may be subject to payment increases include arm loans with terms that initially require payment of interest only. payments may increase significantly when the interest-only period ends and the loan principal begins to amortize. at september 30, 2023 and 2022, these loans totaled $2.85 billion and $2.55 billion, respectively, or approximately 33% and 35% of the residential mortgage portfolio, respectively. the weighted-average number of years before the remainder of the loans, which were still in their interest-only period at september 30, 2023, begins amortizing is six years.
corporate and tax-exempt loans credit risk in our corporate and tax-exempt loan portfolios is monitored on an individual loan basis for trends in borrower operating performance, payment history, credit ratings, collateral performance, loan covenant compliance, municipality demographics and other factors including industry performance and concentrations. as part of the credit review process, the loan rating is reviewed on an ongoing basis to confirm the appropriate risk rating for each credit. the individual loan ratings resulting from semi-annual snc exams are incorporated in our internal loan ratings when the ratings are received. if the snc rating is lower on an individual loan than our internal rating, the loan is downgraded. while we consider historical snc exam results in our loan ratings methodology, differences between the snc exam and internal ratings on individual loans typically arise due to subjectivity of the loan classification process. downgrades resulting from these differences may result in additional raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index provisions for credit losses in periods when snc exam results are received. the majority of our tax-exempt loan portfolio is comprised of loans to investment-grade borrowers. see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information on our allowance for credit losses policies.
credit risk is managed by diversifying the corporate bank loan portfolio. our corporate bank loan portfolio does not contain a significant concentration in any single industry. the following table details the industry concentrations (top five categories) of our corporate bank loans.

the fed's measures to control inflation, including through increases in short-term interest rates, have had a dampening effect on the economy and are likely to continue to do so in the near-term. these and related factors could negatively impact our borrowers, particularly those with heightened exposure to rising interest rates. in response to changing trends and industry-wide challenges, we continue to closely monitor each loan in our commercial real estate portfolio, particularly office real estate, utilizing ltv ratios and other metrics. we are also monitoring any impacts of inflation, higher interest rates, and a potential recession on our corporate loan portfolio. during the year ended september 30, 2023, we reduced our corporate loan exposure in certain sectors with increasing credit concerns and sold approximately $670 million of par value of corporate loans. we may sell additional corporate loans in fiscal 2024 as part of our credit risk mitigation strategies. in addition, while we are well-positioned to lend once activity increases, we expect to be prudent when growing our corporate loan portfolio.
liquidity risk see "item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources" of this form 10-k for information regarding our liquidity and how we manage liquidity risk.
operational risk operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, business disruptions, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes, including cybersecurity incidents (see "item 1a - risk factors" of this form 10-k for a discussion of certain cybersecurity risks). these risks are less direct than credit and market risk, but managing them is critical, particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes and complexity. we operate different businesses in diverse markets and are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees, we could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions, and damage to our reputation. in order to mitigate and control operational risk, we have developed and continue to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization and within such departments as finance, operations, information technology, legal, compliance, risk management, and internal audit. these control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that our various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits. in addition, we have created business continuity plans for critical systems, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate.
we have an operational risk management committee comprised of members of senior management, which reviews and addresses operational risks across our businesses. the committee establishes risk appetite levels for major operational risks, monitors operating unit performance for adherence to defined risk tolerances, and establishes policies for risk management at the enterprise level.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis       index periods of severe market volatility can result in a significantly higher level of transactions on specific days, which may present operational challenges from time to time that may result in losses. these losses can result from, but are not limited to, trade errors, failed transaction settlements, late collateral calls to borrowers and counterparties, or interruptions to our system processing. we did not incur any significant losses related to such operational challenges during the year ended september 30, 2023.
as more fully described in the discussion of our business technology risks included in various risk factors presented in "item 1a - risk factors" of this form 10-k, despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to human error, natural disasters, power loss, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, and other events that could have an impact on the security and stability of our operations.
model risk model risk refers to the possibility of unintended business outcomes arising from the design, implementation or use of models. models are used throughout the firm for a variety of purposes such as the valuation of financial instruments, the calculation of our allowance for credit losses, assessing risk, stress testing, and to assist in making certain business decisions. model risk includes the potential risk that management makes incorrect decisions based upon either incorrect model results or incorrect understanding and use of model results. model risk may also occur when model outputs differ from the expected result. model errors or misuse could result in significant financial loss, inaccurate financial or regulatory reporting, or misaligned business strategies.
model risk management is a separate department within our risk management department and is independent of model owners, users, and developers. our model risk management framework consists primarily of model governance, maintaining the firmwide model inventory, validating and approving models used across the firm, and ongoing monitoring. results of validations and issues identified are reported to the enterprise risk management committee and risk committee of the board of directors. model risk management assumes responsibility for the independent and effective challenge of model completeness, integrity and design based on intended use.
compliance risk compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or reputational damage that the firm may suffer from a failure to comply with applicable laws, external standards, or internal requirements.
we have established a framework to oversee, manage, and mitigate compliance risk throughout the firm, both within and across businesses, functions, legal entities, and jurisdictions. the framework includes roles and responsibilities for the board of directors, senior management, and all three lines of risk management. this framework also includes programs and processes through which the firm identifies, assesses, controls, measures, monitors, and reports on compliance risk and provides compliance-related training throughout the firm. the compliance department plays a key leadership role in the oversight, management, and mitigation of compliance risk throughout the firm. it does this by conducting an annual compliance risk assessment, carrying out compliance monitoring and testing activities, implementing compliance policies, training associates on compliance-related topics, and reporting compliance risk-related issues and metrics to the board of directors and senior management, among other activities.

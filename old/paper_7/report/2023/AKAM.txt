item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a"), should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. see "risk factors" elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements. the forward-looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof.
overview we provide solutions to power and protect life online through our massively distributed edge and cloud platform, which we refer to as akamai connected cloud. akamai connected cloud underpins our cloud computing, security and content delivery solutions, and is central to our financial success. the key factors that influence our financial success are our ability to build on recurring revenue commitments for our security and performance offerings, increase traffic on our network, continue to develop, scale and successfully bring to market our cloud computing platform and compute-to-edge solutions that meet the needs of professional users and enterprises, effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions, develop new products and appropriately manage our capital spending and other expenses. the purpose of this discussion and analysis section is to provide material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations from management's perspective, including to describe and explain key trends, events and other factors that impacted our reported results and that are likely to impact our future performance.
revenue we primarily derive revenue from the sale of services to customers executing contracts having terms of one year or longer, which allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue. services included in our contracts consist of security solutions, the delivery of content, applications and software over the internet, cloud computing solutions and professional services. in addition to a base level of revenue, we are also dependent on our ability to increase our product offerings and to cross-sell additional services to our new and existing customers, particularly for our security and compute solution portfolios. our revenue is also impacted by customer renewals, the rate of adoption and timing of customer offerings, variability of one-time events, usage of cloud computing services and the amount of traffic we serve on our network. geopolitical, economic and other developments that impact our customers' businesses can also impact our ability to attract new customers or continue to cross-sell additional services to existing customers. over the longer term, our ability to expand our product portfolio and to effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions are key factors impacting our revenue growth.
we have observed the following trends related to our revenue in recent years:
•increased sales of our security solutions, led by application security solutions and segmentation solutions from our acquisition of guardicore ltd., and increased sales of our compute solutions, primarily attributable to our acquisition of linode in early 2022, have made a significant contribution to revenue growth. during 2023, security represented the largest share of revenue with security and compute revenue representing over half of our total revenue. we plan to continue to invest in these areas with a focus on further advancing our product portfolios.
•traffic on our network continues to grow at a modest pace as compared to prior years, and is impacted by a number of external factors. most recently, as we and our customers manage through a time of economic headwinds and uncertainty, traffic growth rates have been impacted. conversely, our rate of traffic growth increased significantly during the onset of the covid-19 pandemic and the associated stay-at-home orders across the globe. however, as these orders were lifted and more return-to-work policies were adopted, our traffic growth rates declined. these traffic fluctuations may continue to impact our delivery revenue.
•the prices paid by some of our delivery and security customers have declined in recent years due to competition and contract renewals, which negatively impacts our revenue growth rates. we have been able to mitigate some of the negative impacts to our revenue growth rates by upselling incremental solutions to our existing delivery and security customers. we are taking steps upon contract renewals to optimize how we charge certain high-volume traffic delivery customers, including charging a premium for higher-cost destinations and continuing to maintain alignment between customer traffic volumes and unit pricing.
•revenue from our international operations has generally been growing at a faster pace in recent years than from our u.s. operations, particularly from new customer acquisition and cross-selling of incremental solutions. because we table of contents publicly report in u.s. dollars, our reported revenue results are negatively impacted when the dollar strengthens and benefit when the dollar weakens.
•we have experienced variations in certain types of revenue from quarter-to-quarter. in particular, we typically experience higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year for some of our solutions as a result of holiday season activity. in addition, we experience quarterly variations in revenue attributable to, among other things, the timing of large customer contract renewals; the frequency and timing of purchases of custom solutions or licensed software; the nature and timing of software and gaming releases by our customers; and whether there are large live sporting or other events or situations that impact the amount of media traffic on our network.
expenses our level of profitability is impacted by our expenses, including direct costs to support our revenue such as bandwidth and co-location costs, which includes energy to power our network. we have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years:
•network bandwidth costs represent a significant portion of our cost of revenue. historically, we have been able to mitigate increases in these costs by reducing our network bandwidth costs per unit and investing in internal-use software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network. we will need to continue to effectively manage our bandwidth costs to maintain or improve current levels of profitability.
•co-location costs are also a significant portion of our cost of revenue. as we continue to build out our new compute locations to provide us with the ability to scale our platform, we expect to enter into longer term leases that include certain financial commitments in order to achieve more favorable unit economics. the costs of the financial commitments are expensed ratably over the life of the lease, and, as a result, in some cases, we are incurring costs in advance of these compute locations being fully utilized. we continue to improve our internal-use software and remain disciplined in managing our hardware deployments, particularly for our delivery platform, which enables us to use servers more efficiently. with these efficiencies we have been able to moderate the impact of rising energy costs. we expect to continue to scale our network in the future, which we believe will allow us to effectively manage our co-location costs to maintain or improve current levels of profitability.
•network build-out and supporting service costs represent another significant portion of our cost of revenue. these costs include maintenance and supporting services incurred as we continue to build out our compute infrastructure and maintain our global network, and costs of third-party cloud providers used for some of our operations. we have seen these costs increase in recent years as a result of our network expansion, and particularly the build out of our compute infrastructure. we had also experienced increased costs from third-party cloud providers, but have recently begun to mitigate those costs by migrating to our own cloud solutions and optimizing third-party cloud spend. we will need to continue to effectively manage our network build-out and supporting service costs and continue to migrate third-party cloud services to akamai connected cloud to maintain or improve current levels of profitability.
•our employees are core to the operations of our business, and payroll and related costs, including stock-based compensation, is our largest expense. it is important to the success of operations that we offer competitive compensation packages. however, we remain disciplined in allocating our resources to support our faster growing security and compute solutions, including maintaining operational efficiencies to mitigate the rising cost of talent. in 2023, we redesigned one of our non-executive short-term incentive compensation programs by shifting certain employees from a cash-based to stock-based program. we also introduced a non-executive incentive program tied to our initiative to migrate certain third-party cloud services onto akamai connected cloud. these programs are designed to better align employee incentives with the interests of our stockholders.
•depreciation expense related to our network equipment also contributes to our overall expense levels. in recent years, we have invested in our network as traffic levels have increased and as part of building out our compute infrastructure, which increased our capital expenditures and resulting depreciation expense. we plan to continue to make investments in capital expenditures, however, the focus is to further invest in support of our faster growing compute solutions. due to the software and hardware initiatives we have undertaken to manage our global network more efficiently, the useful lives of our servers have been extended from five to six years effective january 1, 2023, which has offset increased depreciation expense from our network expansion and the build out of our compute infrastructure.

•growth in our international operations incrementally increases our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. because we publicly report in u.s. dollars, our expenses are positively impacted when the dollar strengthens and are negatively impacted when the dollar weakens.
recent acquisitions we acquired certain customer contracts from lumen technologies, inc. ("lumen") in october 2023 and from stackpath, llc ("stackpath") in august 2023. these acquisitions are intended to further strengthen our existing content delivery and other businesses as we transition the acquired customers to our akamai connected cloud and offer our portfolio of other services to these customers. revenue attributable to these asset acquisitions was $20.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2023. we also acquired neosec, inc ("neosec") in may 2023, which is intended to complement our application and api security portfolio by extending its visibility into the rapidly growing api threat landscape, and storageos, inc. ("storageos"), also known as ondat, in march 2023, which is intended to strengthen our cloud computing offerings. neither neosec or ondat included a significant number of employees when we completed the acquisitions.
in march 2022, we acquired linode, an infrastructure-as-a-service platform provider, which allows for developer-friendly cloud computing capabilities. the acquisition was intended to enhance our computing services by enabling us to create a unique cloud platform to build, run and secure applications from the cloud to the edge. linode had approximately 250 employees when we completed the acquisition.
in october 2021, we acquired guardicore whose micro-segmentation solution is designed to limit user access to only those applications that are authorized to communicate with each other, thereby limiting the spread of malware and protecting the flow of enterprise data across the network. guardicore had approximately 270 employees when we completed the acquisition.
global economic conditions global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions continue to impact our business and revenue growth rates. we, along with our customers, continue to manage through an uncertain period of fluctuating inflation, economic uncertainty, uncertain energy supplies, heightened geopolitical tensions, potential for supply chain disruptions, changes in international tax laws, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and elevated interest rates. to the extent these macroeconomic conditions continue, we expect that it may adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.

the increases in our revenue in 2023 as compared to 2022, and 2022 as compared to 2021, was primarily the result of continued growth in sales of our security solutions and the acquisition of linode in march 2022 which contributed to the growth in our compute solutions. the increase in 2023 as compared to 2022 was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our delivery solutions due to the pricing impact of renewals and moderated traffic growth. the increase in 2022 as compared to 2021 was negatively impacted by the significant strengthening of the u.s. dollar and a decline in revenue from our delivery solutions due to a reduction in traffic growth and pricing impact of renewals.
the increase in security solutions revenue for 2023 as compared to 2022, and 2022 as compared to 2021, was due to growth in a number of key products in our security solutions portfolio, including our segmentation and web application firewall solutions, denial of service and bot management solutions. the increase in security solutions revenue for 2023 as compared to 2022 was also due to growth in certain products that combine elements of our security and delivery offerings to provide robust security solutions.
the decrease in delivery solutions revenue for 2023 as compared to 2022 was due to the pricing impact of renewals and moderated traffic growth. the decrease in delivery solutions revenue for 2022 as compared to 2021 was due to a reduction in traffic growth rates as our largest customers are not experiencing the same traffic growth rates as they once were.
table of contents the increase in compute solutions revenue in 2023 as compared to 2022, and 2022 as compared to 2021, was due to growth in compute products, including continued growth in cloud optimization solutions and through the acquisition of linode in the first quarter of 2022. the increase in compute solutions revenue in 2023 as compared to 2022 was also due to a price increase for some of our compute solutions in 2023.

the increase in cost of revenue for 2023 as compared to 2022 was primarily due to:
•co-location fees as a result of investment in akamai connected cloud, particularly as we build out our compute infrastructure to support future growth and scalability;
•bandwidth fees to support the increase in traffic served on our network and for traffic served from higher cost regions;

•network build-out and supporting services due to our infrastructure investment in akamai connected cloud and costs associated with the transition services agreements to support the migration of customer contracts acquired from lumen and stackpath; and
•payroll and related costs, including stock-based compensation, as a result of headcount growth to support our network, the increased expected achievement of our performance-based compensation plans and higher average equity awards to employees driven by the talent market; additionally, stock-based compensation increased due to the shift in one of our compensation programs from cash-based to stock-based.
the increase in cost of revenue for 2023 as compared to 2022 was partially offset by lower depreciation expense of network equipment due to software and hardware initiatives we have implemented to manage our global network more efficiently. as a result, we increased the expected average useful life of our servers from five to six years effective january 1, 2023, which resulted in a reduction to depreciation expense of $62.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2023.
additionally, due to our focus on third-party cloud application costs, including migrating third-party cloud services to our own cloud solutions and optimizing third-party cloud spending which are included in network build-out and supporting services, our third-party cloud costs decreased for 2023 as compared to 2022.
the increase in cost of revenue for 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily due to increased network build-out and supporting services, particularly related to increased supporting services for third-party cloud applications, and increased investment in our network in prior years to support traffic growth, which resulted in higher depreciation costs of our network equipment and growth in expenses related to our co-location facilities including energy to power our network.
during 2024, we expect our cost of revenue to increase as compared to 2023, in particular our co-location costs, due to investments in our network to support the continued growth of our compute solutions. we plan to continue to focus our efforts on managing our operating margins, including our bandwidth and network build-out costs. specifically, we are continuing to take steps to migrate third-party cloud services onto akamai connected cloud, which we expect will continue to reduce third-party cloud services costs.

the increase in research and development expenses for 2023 as compared to 2022 was due to higher payroll and related costs, including stock-based compensation, as a result of headcount growth from our strategic initiatives, annual merit increases, the increased expected achievement of our performance-based compensation plans, a new compensation program tied to our initiative to migrate third-party cloud services onto akamai connected cloud and higher average equity awards to employees driven by the talent market. additionally, stock-based compensation increased due to the shift in one of our compensation programs from cash-based to stock-based. these increases were partially offset by an increase in capitalized salaries and related costs as we focused resources to work on development activities related to our platform.
the increase in research and development expenses for 2022 as compared to 2021 was due to higher payroll and related costs and related stock-based compensation as a result of headcount growth from employees joining us through acquisitions, a reduction in capitalized salaries and related costs as a result of a shift in resources to work on core maintenance activities related to our platform and an increase in other expenses due to an increase in the use of third-party cloud services to support our research and development activities.
table of contents research and development costs are expensed as incurred, other than certain internal-use software development costs eligible for capitalization. capitalized development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external consulting expenses involved in the development of internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we capitalized $77.0 million, $30.0 million and $32.2 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation. these capitalized internal-use software development costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to ten years based on the software developed and its expected useful life.

the increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2023 as compared to 2022 was due to higher payroll and related costs, including stock-based compensation, as a result of annual merit increases, headcount growth and the increased expected achievement of our performance-based compensation plans and other expenses due to increased travel expenses associated with customer meetings and sales events. additionally, stock-based compensation increased due to the shift in one of our compensation programs from cash-based to stock-based.
the increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily due to increased marketing programs and related costs due to advertising and customer events held in 2022. other expenses also increased due to travel associated with customer events and meetings, as well as a sales recognition event during 2022 that did not occur in 2021. such events and travel costs were higher in 2022 than in 2021 due to the rollback of covid-19 pandemic-related restrictions that had been in place in the prior year.
we expect sales and marketing costs to increase in 2024 as compared to 2023, due to our continued investment in go-to-market efforts. however, we plan to continue to carefully manage costs in an effort to manage our operating margins.

the increase in general and administrative expenses for 2023 as compared to 2022 was due to higher payroll and related costs, including stock-based compensation, as a result of annual merit increases, headcount growth, the increased expected achievement of our performance-based compensation plans and higher average equity awards to employees driven by the talent market and other expenses due to increased professional service fees to support our business. additionally, stock-based compensation increased due to the shift in one of our compensation programs from cash-based to stock-based. these increases were partially offset by decreases in facilities-related costs as a result of growth in sublease income from the execution of our flexbase program and acquisition-related costs in connection with our acquisition of linode in the first quarter of 2022.
the increase in general and administrative expenses for 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily due to increased software and related service costs as we transition to and expand usage of cloud-based applications to support our operations, other expenses related to an increase in professional service fees to support our business and acquisition-related costs primarily related to our acquisition of linode. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in payroll and related costs due to a decline in performance-based compensation program achievement.

global functions expense includes payroll, stock-based compensation and other employee-related costs for administrative functions, including finance, purchasing, order entry, human resources, legal, information technology and executive personnel, as well as third-party professional service fees. infrastructure expense includes payroll, stock-based compensation and other employee-related costs for our network infrastructure functions, as well as facility rent expense, depreciation and amortization of facility- and it-related assets, software and related service costs, business insurance and taxes. our network infrastructure function is responsible for network planning, sourcing, architecture evaluation and platform security. other expense includes acquisition-related costs and provision for doubtful accounts.
table of contents during 2024, we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as compared to 2023, in particular payroll and related costs, including stock-based compensation, due to the impact of mid-year merit increases and headcount growth to support the operations of the business. however, we plan to continue to control costs, including reducing our real estate expenses due to excess capacity created by our flexbase program, in an effort to manage our operating margins.

the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets for 2023 as compared to 2022, as well as 2022 as compared to 2021, was the result of amortization of acquired intangible assets related to our recent acquisitions. based on acquired intangible assets as of december 31, 2023, future amortization is expected to be $84.8 million, $80.5 million, $76.1 million, $62.0 million and $49.6 million for the years ending december 31, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively.

the restructuring charge in 2023 was driven by our flexbase program as we exited certain facilities that were no longer needed, resulting in impairments of right-of-use-assets and leasehold improvements. additional charges related to this action may occur; however, we do not expect such charges will materially impact our financial condition or results of operations, and we expect to continue to evaluate our facility footprint going forward. additionally, the restructuring charge in 2023 included the result of certain actions initiated in the first quarter of 2023. management's commitment to an action to restructure certain parts of the company was to enable the prioritization of investments in the fastest growing areas of the business. the restructuring charge for this action includes severance and related expenses for certain headcount reductions.
the restructuring charge in 2022 was primarily related to software impairment charges related to our investment with mitsubishi ufj financial group ("mufg") in the joint venture global open network, inc. ("go-net"), and mufg's decision to suspend go-net's operations, and impairments of right-of-use-assets for facilities that are no longer needed as a result of our flexbase program.
the restructuring charge in 2021 was primarily the result of management's actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020 to better position us to become more agile in delivering our solutions. the restructuring charge for this action includes severance and related expenses for certain headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be implemented due to this action. in addition to the 2020 action, additional charges were incurred in 2021, related to management's launch of its new flexbase program in may 2022. the restructuring charge incurred for this program in 2021 includes impairments of lease-related assets for certain facilities that are no longer needed. these restructuring charges were partially offset by the release of a lease obligation for a facility previously exited as part of management actions initiated in late 2019.

interest and marketable securities income, net primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash and marketable securities balances and income and losses on mutual funds that are associated with our employee non-qualified deferred compensation plan. the increase to interest and marketable securities income, net for 2023 as compared to 2022 was the result of increased marketable securities balances as a result of our august 2023 issuance of $1,265.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2029 and higher interest rates, as well as increased gains associated with the non-qualified deferred compensation plan. the decrease to interest and marketable securities income, net for 2022 as compared to 2021 was due to increased losses associated with the non-qualified deferred compensation plan and lower interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities as a result of lower marketable securities balances in 2022 due to the funding of our acquisitions of linode and guardicore.
interest expense is related to our debt transactions, which are described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the increase to interest expense for 2023 as compared to 2022 was primarily due to the august 2023 issuance of $1,265.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2029. the decrease to interest expense for 2022 as compared to 2021 was the result of the adoption of the new guidance for accounting for convertible senior notes on january 1, 2022, which resulted in the elimination of the amortization of debt discounts.
other (expense) income, net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses mainly due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany transactions and other non-operating expense and income items as well as gains and losses on equity investments. other (expense) income, net for 2022 includes impairments of $8.9 million from equity investments, partially offset by a favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. other (expense) income, net for 2021 includes a $3.7 million gain from the sale of an equity investment. other income (expense), net may fluctuate in the future based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates or other events.

the decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2023 as compared to 2022 was mainly due to a reduction in intercompany sales of intellectual property and the tax on global intangible low-taxed income. these items were partially offset by a decrease in the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and the revaluation of certain foreign income tax liabilities due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
the increase in the provision for income taxes for 2022 as compared to 2021 was mainly due to an intercompany sale of intellectual property, an increase in the tax on global intangible low-taxed income, a decrease in foreign income taxed at lower rates and a decrease in the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. these amounts were partially offset by a decrease in profitability.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates and the benefit of u.s. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. these amounts were partially offset by non-deductible stock-based compensation and the tax on global intangible low-taxed income.

for the year ended december 31, 2021, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates, the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and the benefit of u.s. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. these amounts were partially offset by non-deductible stock-based compensation and state income taxes.
our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events, such as tax benefits from the settlement of employee equity awards, tax law changes and settlements of tax audits and assessments. our effective income tax rate is also impacted by, and may fluctuate in any given period because of, the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates. the organisation for economic co-operation and development ("oecd") and participating oecd member countries continue to work toward the enactment of a 15% global minimum corporate tax rate. the global minimum tax is a significant structural change to the international taxation framework, which is expected to affect us beginning in 2024. although global enactment has begun, the oecd and participating countries continue to work on defining the underlying rules and administrative procedures. we are currently monitoring these developments and evaluating the impact. while we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will increase as a result of these changes, we do not expect it to have a material impact to our results of operations or cash flows.
see "risk factors" and refer to note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate in the next 12 months.

the amounts reflected in (gain) loss from equity method investment relate to our investment with mufg in a joint venture, go-net. go-net intended to operate a blockchain-based online payment network. in february 2022, mufg, the majority owner of go-net, announced it was preparing to suspend the operations of go-net and to ultimately liquidate it. the gain from equity method investment in 2023 was related to the liquidation and disbursement of our portion of go-net's remaining assets, which were previously impaired. the loss from equity method investment in 2022 was the result of our impairment of our investment in go-net in the first quarter of 2022 since the operations will no longer generate future cash flows. we recorded a loss of $14.0 million in 2021, which reflects our share of the losses incurred by go-net during that year. we do not expect additional activity related to this investment.
non-gaap financial measures in addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ("gaap") we provide additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with gaap ("non-gaap financial measures"). management uses non-gaap financial measures, in addition to gaap financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to measure executive compensation and to evaluate our financial performance. these non-gaap financial measures are non-gaap income from operations, non-gaap operating margin, non-gaap net income, non-gaap net income per diluted share, adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, capital expenditures and impact of foreign currency exchange rates, as discussed below.
management believes that these non-gaap financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as they facilitate comparison of financial results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. management also believes that these non-gaap financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. these non-gaap table of contents financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent or not reflective of our ongoing operating results.
the non-gaap financial measures do not replace the presentation of our gaap financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with gaap.
the non-gaap adjustments, and our basis for excluding them from non-gaap financial measures, are outlined below:
•amortization of acquired intangible assets - we have incurred amortization of intangible assets, included in our gaap financial statements, related to various acquisitions we have made. the amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and is unique to each acquisition; therefore, we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-gaap financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-acquisition operating results.
•stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation - although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to our employees, the grant date fair value varies based on the stock price at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. this makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret; therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation from our non-gaap financial measures in order to highlight the performance of our core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate our performance and compare our operating results to peer companies.
•acquisition-related costs - acquisition-related costs include transaction fees, advisory fees, due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities, as well as certain additional compensation costs payable to employees acquired from the linode acquisition if employed for a certain period of time. the additional compensation cost was initiated by and determined by the seller and is in addition to normal levels of compensation, including retention programs, offered by akamai. acquisition-related costs are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions, and we exclude acquisition-related costs from our non-gaap financial measures to provide a useful comparison of operating results to prior periods and to peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of our acquisition transactions and do not reflect our core operations.
•restructuring charge - we have incurred restructuring charges from programs that have significantly changed either the scope of the business undertaken by us or the manner in which that business is conducted. these charges include severance and related expenses for workforce reductions, impairments of long-lived assets that will no longer be used in operations (including right-of-use assets, other facility-related property and equipment and internal-use software) and termination fees for any contracts cancelled as part of these programs. we exclude these items from our non-gaap financial measures when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. in addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business.
•amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and amortization of capitalized interest expense - we have convertible senior notes outstanding that mature in 2029, 2027 and 2025. the issuance costs of the convertible senior notes are amortized to interest expense and are excluded from our non-gaap results because management believes the non-cash amortization expense is not representative of ongoing operating performance. the imputed interest rates of the 2027 and 2025 convertible senior notes were 3.10% and 4.26%, respectively. this is a result of the debt discounts recorded for the conversion features that, prior to january 1, 2022, were required to be separately accounted for as equity under gaap, thereby reducing the carrying values of the convertible debt instruments. the debt discounts were amortized as interest expense. on january 1, 2022, we adopted the new guidance for accounting for convertible instruments. this new guidance eliminated separate accounting for the equity portion, and thus the amortization of the debt discount that was recorded as interest expense. prior to january 1, 2022, we excluded this non-cash interest expense from our non-gaap results because it was not representative of ongoing operating performance. after january 1, 2022, this interest expense is no longer included in or excluded from gaap or non-gaap results.

•gains and losses on investments - we have recorded gains and losses from the disposition, changes to fair value and impairment of certain investments. we believe excluding these amounts from our non-gaap financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to these gains and losses are not representative of our core business operations and ongoing operating performance.
•gains and losses from equity method investment - we record income or losses on our share of earnings and losses from our equity method investment, and any gains from returns of investments or impairments. we exclude such income and losses because we do not have direct control over the operations of the investment and the related income and losses are not representative of our core business operations.
•income tax effect of non-gaap adjustments and certain discrete tax items - the non-gaap adjustments described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. the income tax effect of non-gaap adjustments is the difference between gaap and non-gaap income tax expense. non-gaap income tax expense is computed on non-gaap pre-tax income (gaap pre-tax income adjusted for non-gaap adjustments) and excludes certain discrete tax items (such as the impact of intercompany sales of intellectual property related to our acquisitions), if any. we believe that applying the non-gaap adjustments and their related income tax effect allows us to highlight income attributable to our core operations.

(1) shares used in non-gaap per diluted share calculations have been adjusted for the periods presented for the benefit of our note hedge transactions. during the periods presented, our average stock price was in excess of $95.10, which is the initial conversion price of our convertible senior notes due in 2025. see further discussion below.
(2) may not foot due to rounding.
non-gaap net income per diluted share is calculated as non-gaap net income divided by weighted average diluted common shares outstanding. diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are adjusted in non-gaap per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of $1,265 million of convertible senior notes due 2029 and the issuances of $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 and 2025, respectively. under gaap, shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully-diluted share calculation until they are delivered. however, we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur, so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of operating performance. with respect to the convertible senior notes due in each of 2029, 2027 and 2025, unless our weighted average stock price is greater than $126.31, $116.18 and $95.10, respectively, the initial conversion prices, there will be no difference between gaap and non-gaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.
we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. adjusted ebitda eliminates items that we do not consider to be part of our core operations. we define adjusted ebitda as gaap net income excluding the following items: interest and marketable securities income and losses; income taxes; depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; foreign exchange gains and losses; interest expense; amortization of capitalized interest expense; certain gains and losses on investments; income and losses from equity method investments; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time. adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda stated as a percentage of revenue.

impact of foreign currency exchange rates revenue and earnings from our international operations have historically been an important contributor to our financial results. consequently, our financial results have been impacted, and management expects they will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, when the local currencies of our international subsidiaries weaken, generally our consolidated results stated in u.s. dollars are negatively impacted.
because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods. the dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount. the percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period.
liquidity and capital resources to date, we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations. as of december 31, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which primarily consisted of corporate bonds, u.s. government agency obligations and money market funds, totaled $2.3 billion. we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high-quality credit standards, as specified in our investment policy. our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times.
changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in, among other things, working capital items such as accounts receivable, deferred revenue, accounts payable, various accrued expenses and operating lease obligations, as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases, debt repayments and issuances, acquisitions, purchases and sales of marketable securities, cash paid for acquisitions and similar events. we believe that our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial stability and flexibility to enable us to continue to make investments at opportune times. we expect to continue to evaluate strategic investments to strengthen our business.
table of contents as of december 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $232.9 million held in accounts outside the u.s. the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act establishes a territorial tax system in the u.s., which provides companies with the potential ability to repatriate earnings with minimal u.s. federal income tax impact. as a result, our liquidity is not expected to be materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the u.s.

the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2023 as compared to 2022 was due to increased profitability in 2023, as well as cash paid for income taxes related to an intercompany sale of intellectual property and additional compensation costs paid to employees acquired from the linode acquisition based on an agreement with the acquiree, both of which occurred in 2022 and did not re-occur in 2023.
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily due to income taxes paid on an intercompany sale of intellectual property, lower profitability and timing of vendor payments.

the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2023 as compared to 2022 was due to an increase in purchases of marketable securities with the proceeds from our august 2023 issuance of convertible senior notes and purchases of property and equipment related to our compute infrastructure build-out. these increases were partially offset by cash paid for the acquisition of linode in march 2022 and by net marketable securities activity as we sold marketable securities during 2022 to fund the acquisition.
the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2022 as compared to 2021 was due to a decrease in purchases of marketable securities, as we did not reinvest our matured securities in order to fund our acquisition of linode in march 2022, and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment as we reduced spending related to our delivery solutions as we focused on higher growth initiatives, partially offset by cash paid for the acquisition of linode.

the increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2023 as compared to 2022 was due to the net proceeds from our convertible senior notes due 2029 that were issued in august 2023. this increase was partially offset by an increase in repurchases of our common stock.
the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily the result of increased repurchases of our common stock.
our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program that is effective from january 2022 through december 2024, and during 2023, 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 7.8 million, 6.4 million and 4.7 million shares of our common stock, respectively, at an average price per share of $83.83, $94.96 and $109.97, respectively. our goal for the share repurchase program is to offset the dilution created by our employee equity compensation programs over time and provide the flexibility to return capital to stockholders as business and market conditions warrant, while still preserving our ability to pursue other strategic opportunities. the timing and amount of any future common stock repurchases will be determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors.
convertible senior notes in august 2023, we issued $1,265.0 million in principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2029 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity our $1,150.0 million outstanding aggregate principle amount of convertible senior notes due in 2025. additionally, we used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering for repurchases of our common stock.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $3,565.0 million of convertible senior notes outstanding that are senior unsecured obligations and bear interest payable semi-annually in arrears. these notes mature between may 2025 and february 2029. the terms of the notes and the hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
revolving credit facility in november 2022, we entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement ("2022 credit agreement") which replaced the revolving credit agreement that we entered into in may 2018. the 2022 credit agreement allows us to borrow up to $500.0 million at various interest rates and contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants. there were no outstanding borrowings under the 2022 credit agreement as of december 31, 2023. the terms of the revolving credit agreements are discussed more fully in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
operating leases we have entered into operating leases for real estate assets related to office space and co-location assets related to space or racks at co-location facilities and related equipment for our servers and other networking equipment. as of december 31, 2023 the total obligation under these agreements was $1,144.2 million, of which $224.2 million is payable in the next 12 months. we have also executed additional operating leases that will commence in 2024 for $195.0 million. the operating lease terms and maturities are discussed more fully in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k table of contents purchase commitments we enter into long-term agreements with network and internet service providers for bandwidth, as well as execute purchase orders for the purchase of goods or services in the ordinary course of business, which may contain minimum commitments. these minimum commitments may vary from period to period depending on the timing and length of contract renewals with our vendors, and on our plans for network expansion, including our expansion plans related to our compute business.
liquidity outlook based on our present business plan, we expect our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations to be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months. our foreseeable cash needs, in addition to our recurring operating costs, include our expected capital expenditures, investments in information technology, potential strategic acquisitions, anticipated share repurchases, lease and purchase commitments and settlements of other liabilities.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers and directors, shareholders of acquired companies, joint venture partners and third parties to which we license technology. generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by a third party due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. these indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor's accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements. the fair value of guarantees issued or modified during 2023 and 2022 was determined to be immaterial.
significant accounting policies and estimates see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for information regarding recent and newly adopted accounting pronouncements.
application of critical accounting policies and estimates overview our md&a is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and related reserves, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, capitalized internal-use software development costs, goodwill and acquired intangible assets, income tax reserves, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets and stock-based compensation. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. actual results may differ from these estimates. for a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
definitions we define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes.
table of contents review of critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition our contracts with customers sometimes include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer. determining whether services are distinct performance obligations often requires the exercise of judgment by management. advanced features that enhance a main product or service and are highly interrelated are generally not considered distinct; rather, they are combined with the service they relate to into one performance obligation. different determinations related to combining services into performance obligations could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period.
determination of the standalone selling price ("ssp") for each distinct performance obligation in a contract also requires the exercise of judgment by management. ssp is based on observable inputs such as the price we charge for the service when sold separately, or the discounted list price per management's approved price list. in cases where services are not sold separately or price list rates are not available, a cost-plus-margin approach or adjusted market approach is used to determine ssp. changes to ssp could result in differences in the allocation of transaction price among performance obligations, which could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period.
from time to time, we enter into contracts to sell services or license technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time that we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises. consideration payable to a customer is reviewed as part of the transaction price. if the payment to the customer does not represent payment for a distinct service, revenue is recognized only up to the net amount of consideration after customer payment obligations are considered. different determinations on whether a payment represents a distinct service could result in differences in the amount of revenue recognized.
we may also resell licenses or services of third parties. if we are acting as an agent in an arrangement with a customer to provide third party services, the transaction price reflects only the net amount to which we will be entitled, after accounting for payments made to the third party responsible for satisfying the performance obligation. different determinations on whether we are acting as an agent or a principal could change the amount of revenue recognized.
accounts receivable and related reserves trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. in addition to trade accounts receivable, our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month. we record allowances against our accounts receivable balance, primarily for current expected credit losses. increases and decreases in the allowance for current expected credit losses are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income.
estimates are used in determining our allowance for current expected credit losses using historical loss rates for the previous twelve months as well as expectations about the future where we have been able to develop forecasts to supports our estimates. in addition, the allowance for current expected credit losses considers outstanding balances on a customer-specific, account-by-account basis. we assess collectability based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for services previously provided. we also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers. if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided, any future services provided to that customer will result in the creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments.
valuation and impairment of marketable securities we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period. fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (principally cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities) that have been classified as level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date. fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability.
table of contents marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other-than-temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including, among other factors, the duration of the period that, and extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis; the financial health of, and business outlook for, the issuer, including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors; overall market conditions and trends; and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, a write-down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established. assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty. write-downs, if recorded, could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if, among other things, relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment.
impairment of long-lived assets we review our long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and acquired intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. when such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. if this comparison indicates that impairment is present, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. if a readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset. the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long-lived assets, the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows. changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations.
goodwill and acquired intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of december 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. we have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team. we have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit. the fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of december 31, 2023 and 2022, and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date.
acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies, customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, non-compete agreements and acquired license rights. we engage third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets. fair value and useful life determinations may be based on, among other factors, estimates of future expected cash flows, royalty cost savings and appropriate discount rates used in calculating present values. the value of our acquired intangible assets could be different if we had used different assumption. acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets.
income taxes our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized.
we currently have net deferred tax assets, comprised of net operating loss ("nol"), carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes, management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability, the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards, applicable tax rates, transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies. judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain; therefore, actual results could differ materially from our projections.
we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions. these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about table of contents the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated.
uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our consolidated financial statements using a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. first, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. if the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained based on technical merit, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
accounting for stock-based compensation we issue stock awards as part of our compensation program which includes stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units and employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan. for equity classified awards, we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period. for liability classified awards, the fair value is determined each reporting period beginning at the grant date until final vesting. we have selected the black-scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards and the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of market-based restricted stock unit awards. determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock. our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods. changes to the assumptions may have an impact on the fair value of stock awards, which could have an impact on our financial statements. judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock awards that are expected to be forfeited. should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted. in addition, for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions, we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved. changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have an impact on our stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations.
capitalized internal-use software costs we capitalize salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal-use software development projects, as well as interest expense related to our convertible senior notes. capitalization begins during the application development stage, once the preliminary project stage has been completed. if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously-developed software, we assess whether the enhancement creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. once the project is available for general release, capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization. we periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internal-use software for impairment. changes in our estimates related to internal-use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period.

item 7.       management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (all amounts in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted)
general during the year ended december 31, 2023, the company's revenues from continuing operations were $12.2 billion, an increase of 2.5% from $11.9 billion in 2022. the 2.5% increase in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period in 2022 was due to acquisitions, net of divestitures of 1.7%, organic revenue of 0.6%, and favorable foreign currency translation of 0.2%. the 0.6% increase in organic revenue was due to an 8.7% increase in the company's organic base business (base business includes the company's business operations except for covid-19 pcr and antibody testing (covid-19 testing)), partially offset by an 8.1% decrease in covid-19 testing.
the company defines organic growth as the increase in revenue excluding the year over year impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and currency. acquisition and divestiture impact is considered for a twelve-month period following the close of each transaction.
on june 30, 2023, the company completed the previously announced spin-off of fortrea from the company.
the spin-off of fortrea was achieved through the company's pro-rata distribution of 100% of the outstanding shares of fortrea common stock to holders of record of labcorp common stock. each holder of record of labcorp common stock received one share of fortrea common stock for every share of labcorp common stock held at 5:00 p.m., burlington, north carolina time on june 20, 2023, the record date for the distribution.
in june 2023, fortrea, prior to the spin-off and while a subsidiary of the company, issued $570.0 of 7.500% senior secured notes due 2030 (the fortrea notes). the proceeds from the fortrea notes were used to fund cash payments of approximately $1,600.0 to the company in connection with the spin-off. the company does not guarantee the fortrea notes following the spin-off. also in june 2023, fortrea holdings inc. entered into three floating secured overnight financing rate (sofr) credit facilities totaling $1,520.0. these are comprised of $450.0 revolver maturing june 30, 2028; $500.0 term loan a maturing june 30, 2028; and $570.0 term loan b maturing june 30, 2030.
upon closing of the spin-off transaction, fortrea made a cash distribution to the company of approximately $1,600.0 as partial consideration for the assets that the company contributed to fortrea in connection with the spin-off. the company used these proceeds toward a 1000.0 accelerated share repurchase program and paying down $300.0 of debt that matured in 2023, with the remaining funds to be returned to shareholders through additional future share repurchases and/or cash dividends.
all current and historical operating results of fortrea are presented as discontinued operations, net of tax, in the consolidated statement of operations. the spin-off is expected to be treated as tax-free for the company and its shareholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes.
as a result of the spin-off of fortrea, the company recast segment results to exclude the historical results of the cdcs business for all periods presented. the remaining operations of the previously reported drug development segment has been renamed the biopharma laboratory services segment.
following the spin-off, the company believes that it is positioned to:
•invest in r&d and innovation to develop and launch diagnostic advancements globally in key clinical areas including oncology, women's health, autoimmune disease and neurology through organic and inorganic opportunities;
•utilize its worldwide laboratory network to serve a broad, growing and global customer base including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, physicians, health systems, consumers, and other start-ups and laboratories that require lab services or diagnostic testing; and
•launch innovative tests globally, providing patients, physicians, health systems and pharmaceutical companies with access to its advanced science, technology and diagnostic capabilities.

the increase in effective tax rate as compared with the prior year is primarily attributable to the unfavorable impact of current year goodwill impairment of the early development reporting unit. in contrast, the 2022 goodwill impairment of the early development reporting unit was more than offset by favorable adjustments attributable to research and development tax credits, changes in effective state income tax rates, and deferred tax adjustments.
the 2022 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the company's research and development tax credits, changes in effective state income tax rates, and deferred tax adjustments. during the third quarter of 2022, the company completed a detailed domestic research and development tax credit analysis for the 2019, 2020, and 2021 tax years that resulted in an incremental income tax benefit. the 2021 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by stock-based compensation arrangements that was offset by the deferred revaluation related to the u.k. rate change.
operating results by segment during the fourth quarter of 2022, the company modified the segment performance measure to exclude the amortization of intangibles and other assets, restructuring and other charges, goodwill and other asset impairments, and certain corporate charges for items such as transaction costs, covid-19 costs, and other special items. these changes align with how the chief operating decision maker now evaluates segment performance and allocates resources. prior periods have been conformed for index comparability.

cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2023, the company's continuing operations provided $1,202.3 of cash as compared to $1,764.8 in 2022 and $2,846.3 in 2021. the $562.5 decrease in cash provided from operations in 2023 as compared with the corresponding 2022 period was primarily due to lower covid-19 testing earnings, spin-off related items and higher working capital, partially offset by increased base business earnings. the $1,081.5 decrease in cash provided from operations in 2022 as compared with the corresponding 2021 period was primarily due to lower covid-19 testing.
cash flows from investing activities net cash used by continuing investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $1,146.8 as compared to net cash used by continuing investing activities of $1,599.6 for the year ended december 31, 2022 and $845.7 for the year ended december 31, 2021. the $452.8 decrease in net cash used by investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022, was primarily due to a year over year decrease of $492.5 in cash paid for acquisitions. the $753.9 increase in net cash used by investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, was primarily due to a year over year increase of $667.1 in cash paid for acquisitions and a year over year decrease in proceeds from sale of $85.9.
capital expenditures were $453.6, $429.3, and $421.5 for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. capital expenditures in 2023 were 3.7% of revenues, primarily in connection with projects to support growth in the company's core businesses. the company intends to continue to pursue acquisitions to drive growth, to make important investments in its business, including in information technology, and to improve efficiency and enable the execution of the company's mission. such expenditures are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations or, as needed, through borrowings under debt facilities, including the company's revolving credit facility or any successor facility. the company expects capital expenditures in 2024 to be approximately 3.5% of revenues, primarily in connection with projects to support growth in the company's core businesses, facility updates, projects related to launchpad, and further acquisition integration initiatives.
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in continuing financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $1,559.0 compared to cash used in continuing financing activities of $1,322.2 for the year ended december 31, 2022. this movement in cash within financing activities for 2023, as compared to 2022, was primarily a result of $1,000.0 of share repurchases and $300.0 in senior note repayments in 2023 compared to $1,100.0 of share repurchases in 2022 and the commencement of quarterly dividend payments in the second quarter of 2022.
on may 26, 2021, the company issued new senior notes representing $1,000.0 in debt securities and consisting of $500.0 aggregate principal amount of 1.55% senior notes due 2026 and $500.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.70% senior notes due 2031. interest on these notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year, commencing on december 1, 2021. net proceeds from the offering of these notes were $989.4 after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses of the offering. the net proceeds were used to redeem, prior to maturity, the company's outstanding 3.20% senior notes due 2022 and 3.75% senior notes due 2022.
during the second quarter of 2021, the company entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements for its 2.70% senior notes due 2031 with an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 and variable interest rates based on three-month libor (changed to sofr in 2023) plus 1.0706%. these instruments are designated as hedges against changes in the fair value of a portion of the company's long-term debt. the aggregate fair value of $69.6 at december 31, 2023, was included as a index component of other long-term liabilities and deducted from the reported value of the senior notes.
on april 30, 2021, the company amended and restated its revolving credit facility. it consists of a five-year revolving facility in the principal amount of up to $1,000.0, with the option of increasing the facility by up to an additional $500.0, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders to provide such additional amounts and certain other customary conditions. the company is required to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility, at a per annum rate ranging from 0.100% to 0.225%, depending on the company's debt ratings. borrowings under the revolving credit facility will accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the company's election, either (x) a libor (changed to sofr in 2023) rate plus a margin ranging from 0.775% to 1.275% or (y) a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0% to 0.275%, in each case, depending on the company's debt ratings.
the company continues to evaluate its outstanding debt portfolio to take advantage of market conditions that would allow the company to reduce its interest rate or financing risk and provide a lower long-term borrowing cost. the company anticipates that it will refinance the $1,000.0 in debt coming due during 2024.
under the company's revolving credit facility, the company is subject to negative covenants limiting subsidiary indebtedness and certain other covenants typical for investment grade-rated borrowers and the company is required to maintain certain leverage ratios. the company was in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit facility at december 31, 2023, and expects that it will remain in compliance with its existing debt covenants for the next twelve months.
during 2023, the company repurchased 4.8 shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $206.85 for a total cost of $1,000.0. the company has accrued $9.0 of excise tax related to this accelerated share repurchase which will be paid in april 2024. at the end of 2023, the company had outstanding authorization from the board to purchase $530.4 of company common stock. the repurchase authorization has no expiration date.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, the company purchased 4.7 shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $233.48 per share for a total cost of $1,100.0. when the company repurchases shares, the amount paid to repurchase the shares in excess of the par or stated value is allocated to additional paid-in-capital unless subject to limitation or the balance in additional paid-in-capital is exhausted. remaining amounts are recognized as a reduction in retained earnings.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, the company paid $254.0 in common stock dividends. on january 12, 2024, the company announced a cash dividend of $0.72 per share of common stock for the first quarter, or approximately $61.5 in the aggregate. the dividend will be payable on march 13, 2024, to stockholders of record of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of the close of business on february 27, 2024. the declaration and payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of the company's board of directors.
credit ratings the company's investment grade debt ratings from moody's and standard & poor's (s&p) contribute to its ability to access capital markets.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company does not have transactions or relationships with "special purpose" entities, and the company does not have any off-balance sheet financing other than normal operating leases and letters of credit.
other commercial commitments as of december 31, 2023, the company provided letters of credit aggregating approximately $91.3, primarily in connection with certain insurance programs which are renewed annually.
the contractual value of the noncontrolling interest put in the company's ontario subsidiary totaled $15.5 and $15.0 at december 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and has been classified as mezzanine equity in the company's consolidated balance sheet.
based on current and projected levels of cash flows from operations, coupled with availability under its revolving credit facility, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet both its anticipated short-term and long-term cash needs for the next 12 months and the reasonably foreseeable future; however, the company continually reassesses its liquidity position in light of market conditions and other relevant factors.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods.
index while the company believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent, they are by their very nature estimates of amounts that will depend on future events. accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates. the company's audit committee periodically reviews the company's significant accounting policies. the company's critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following:
•revenue recognition;
•business combinations;
•income taxes;
•goodwill and indefinite-lived assets; and
•legal contingencies.
revenue recognition dx within the dx segment, a revenue transaction is initiated when dx receives a requisition order to perform a diagnostic test. the information provided on the requisition form is used to determine the party that will be billed for the testing performed and the expected reimbursement. dx recognizes revenue and satisfies its performance obligation for services rendered when the testing process is complete and the associated results are reported. the dx segment also enters into lab management agreements which have monthly and non-testing based fees which are recognized each month as the services are provided. revenues are distributed among four payer portfolios - clients, patients, medicare and medicaid and third party. dx considers negotiated discounts and anticipated adjustments, including historical collection experience for the payer portfolio, when revenues are recorded.
the following are descriptions of the dx payer portfolios:
clients client payers represent the portion of dx's revenue related to physicians, hospitals, health systems, accountable care organizations, employers and other entities where payment is received exclusively from the entity ordering the testing service. generally, client revenues are recorded on a fee-for-service basis at dx's client list price, less any negotiated discount. a portion of client billing is for laboratory management services, collection kits and other non-testing services or products. in these cases, revenue is recognized when services are rendered or delivered.
patients this portfolio includes revenue from uninsured patients and member cost-share for insured patients (e.g., coinsurance, deductibles and non-covered services). uninsured patients are billed based upon dx's patient fee schedules, net of any discounts negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients. dx bills insured patients as directed by their health plan and after consideration of the fees and terms associated with an established health plan contract.
medicare and medicaid this portfolio relates to fee-for-service revenue from traditional medicare and medicaid programs. net revenue from these programs is based on the fee schedule established by the related government authority. in addition to contractual discounts, other adjustments including anticipated payer denials are considered when determining net revenue. any remaining adjustments to revenue are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement. these adjustments are not material to dx's results of operations in any period presented.
third party third party includes revenue related to mcos. the majority of dx's third-party revenue is reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis. these payers are billed at dx's established list price and revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts. the majority of dx's mco revenues are recorded based upon contractually negotiated fee schedules with revenues for non-contracted mcos recorded based on historical reimbursement experience.
third-party reimbursement is also received through capitation agreements with mcos and independent physician associations (ipas). under capitated agreements, revenue is recognized based on a negotiated per-member, per-month payment for an agreed upon menu of tests, or based upon the proportionate share earned by dx from a capitation pool. when the agreed upon reimbursement is based solely on an established rate per member, revenue is not impacted by the volume of testing performed. under a capitation pool arrangement, the aggregate value of an established rate per member is distributed based on the volume and complexity of the procedures performed by laboratories participating in the agreement. dx recognizes revenue monthly, based upon the established capitation rate or anticipated distribution from a capitated pool.
dx has a formal process to estimate implicit price concessions for uncollectable accounts. the majority of dx's collection risk is related to accounts receivable from both insured and uninsured patients who are unwilling or unable to pay. anticipated index write-offs are recorded as adjustments to revenue at an amount considered necessary to record the segment's revenue at its net realizable value. in addition to contractual discounts, other adjustments including anticipated payer denials and other external factors that could affect the collectability of its receivables are considered when determining revenue and the net receivable amount. any remaining adjustments to revenue are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement. these adjustments are not material to dx's results of operations in any period presented.
bls bls revenue is generally recognized over time, as the services are delivered to the customer, based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. the majority of bls's contracts contain a single performance obligation, as bls provides a significant service of integrating all promises in the contract and the promises are highly interdependent and interrelated with one another. for contracts that include multiple performance obligations, bls allocates the contract value to the goods and services based on a customer price list, if available. if a price list is not available, bls will estimate the transaction price using either market prices or an "expected cost plus margin" approach. the total contract value is estimated at the beginning of the contract, and is equal to the amount expected to be billed to the customer. these contracts generally take the form of fixed-price or fee-for-service arrangements subject to pricing adjustments based on changes in scope.
fixed-price contracts are typically recognized as revenue over time based on a proportional-performance basis, using either input or output methods that are specific to the service provided. in an output method, revenue is determined by dividing the actual units of output achieved by the total units of output required under the contract and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. when using an input method, revenue is recognized by dividing the actual costs incurred by the total estimated cost expected to complete the contract, and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. contract costs principally include direct labor costs, research model costs and allocated overhead costs. the estimate of total costs expected to complete the contract requires significant judgment and these estimates are reviewed periodically. any adjustments to these estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period they become known.
fee-for-service contracts are typically priced based on transaction volume or time and materials. for volume-based contracts the contract value is entirely variable and revenue is recognized as the specific product or service is completed. for services billed based on time and materials, revenue is recognized using the right to invoice practical expedient.
contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements. generally, when contract modifications create new performance obligations, the modification is considered to be a separate contract and revenue is recognized prospectively. when contract modifications change existing performance obligations, the impact on the existing transaction price and measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates is generally recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis.
most contracts are terminable with or without cause by the customer, either immediately or upon notice. these contracts often require payment to bls of expenses incurred and fees earned to date and, in some cases, a termination fee or a payment to bls of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by bls under the contract if it had not been terminated early. termination fees are included in revenues when services have been performed and realization is assured.
bls incurs sales commissions in the process of obtaining contracts with customers, which are recoverable through the service fees in the contract. sales commissions that are payable upon contract award are recognized as assets and amortized over the expected contract term, along with related payroll tax expense. the amortization of commission expense is based on the weighted average contract duration for all commissionable awards in the respective business in which the commission expense is paid, which approximates the period over which goods and services are transferred to the customer. the amortization period of sales commissions ranges from approximately 1 to 5 years, depending on the business. for businesses that enter primarily short-term contracts, bls applies the practical expedient which allows costs to obtain a contract to be expensed when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that would otherwise have been recognized is one year or less. amortization of assets from sales commissions is included in selling, general, and administrative expense.
bls incurs costs to fulfill contracts with customers, which are recoverable through the service fees in the contract. contract fulfillment costs include software implementation costs and setup costs for certain services. these costs are recognized as assets and amortized over the expected term of the contract to which the implementation relates, which is the period over which services are expected to be provided to the customer. this period typically ranges from 2 to 5 years. amortization of deferred contract fulfillment costs is included in cost of goods sold.
business combinations the company accounts for business combination transactions under the acquisition method of accounting and reported the results of operations of the acquired entities from its respective date of acquisition. assets acquired were recorded at their index estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. estimated fair values were based on various valuation methodologies, including an income approach using primarily discounted cash flow techniques for the customer relationships intangible assets. the aforementioned income methods utilize management's estimates of future operating results and cash flows discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects market participant assumptions. the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed over the fair value of the assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. the goodwill reflects management's expectations of the ability to gain access to and penetrate the acquired entities' historical patient base and the benefits of being able to leverage operational efficiencies with favorable growth opportunities based on positive demographic trends in the market.
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. the company does not recognize a tax benefit, unless the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, the company recognizes a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that the company believes is greater than 50% likely to be realized. the company records interest and penalties in income tax expense.
goodwill and indefinite-lived assets the company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. the annual impairment test for goodwill includes an option to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value. reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by management. if the company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the company performs the quantitative goodwill impairment test. the company may also choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in its goodwill assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative assessment. the company recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
in the qualitative assessment, the company considers relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit, including (i) current year results, (ii) financial performance versus management's annual and five-year strategic plans, (iii) changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year, (iv) industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates, (v) macroeconomic conditions, including discount rate changes, and (vi) changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit. if applicable, performance in recent years is compared to forecasts included in prior quantitative valuations. based on the results of the qualitative assessment, if the company concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying values of the reporting unit, then no quantitative assessment is performed.
the quantitative assessment includes the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit as compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. the company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. the income-based approach is based on the reporting unit's forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to the present value using the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. for the market-based approach, the company utilizes a number of factors such as publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of the company as well as operating results, business plans, market multiples, and present value techniques. based upon the range of estimated values developed from the income and market-based methods, the company determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required.
the income-based fair value methodology requires management's assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates and conditions in the capital markets, many of which are outside of management's control. at the reporting unit level, fair value estimation requires management's assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit, along with assessment of the reporting unit's strategies and forecasts of future cash flows. forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management's estimates and assumptions regarding:
•annual cash flows, on a debt-free basis, arising from future revenues and profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending and income taxes for at least a five-year forecast period.
index
•a terminal growth rate for years beyond the forecast period. the terminal growth rate is selected based on consideration of growth rates used in the forecast period, historical performance of the reporting unit and economic conditions.
•a discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows. a discount rate considers the risk-free rate of return on long-term treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparable companies, the beta obtained from the comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. in addition, the discount rate may consider any -specific risk in achieving the prospective financial information.
under the market-based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of the reporting units.
management performed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023. the company elected to perform the qualitative assessment for goodwill and intangible assets for the domestic dx and clinical trials testing solutions (ctts) bls reporting units and a quantitative assessment for the early development (ed) bls reporting unit and the canadian reporting unit, which includes indefinite-lived assets consisting of acquired canadian licenses. based upon the results of the qualitative and quantitative assessments, the company concluded that the fair values of its domestic dx, ctts and canadian reporting units, as of october 1, 2023, were greater than the carrying values. however, due to lower demand in the ed reporting unit in late 2023 which the company anticipates will continue into early 2024, there is an expectation of lower near term revenue and profitability. therefore, the company concluded that the fair value of the ed reporting unit was less than carrying value and recorded a goodwill impairment of $333.6 in the bls segment.
although the company believes that the current assumptions and estimates used in its goodwill analysis are reasonable, supportable, and appropriate, continued efforts to maintain or improve the performance of these businesses could be impacted by unfavorable or unforeseen changes which could impact the existing assumptions used in the impairment analysis. various factors could reasonably be expected to unfavorably impact existing assumptions: primarily delays in new customer bookings and the related delay in revenue from new customers, increases in customer termination activity or increases in operating costs. accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for the purposes of the goodwill impairment analysis will prove to be accurate predictions of future performance. it is possible that the company's conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods. there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in the company's goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future, if, for example, (i) the businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2023 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including loss of major customers, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda.
legal contingencies the company is involved from time to time in various claims and legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation (including those described in more detail below), arising in the ordinary course of business. these matters include, but are not limited to, intellectual property disputes, commercial and contract disputes, professional liability claims, employee-related matters, transaction related disputes, securities and corporate law matters, and inquiries, including subpoenas and other civil investigative demands, from governmental agencies, medicare or medicaid payers and mcos reviewing billing practices or requesting comment on allegations of billing irregularities that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties.
the company also is named from time to time in suits brought under the qui tam provisions of the false claims act and comparable state laws. these suits typically allege that the company has made false statements and/or certifications in connection with claims for payment from u.s. federal or state healthcare programs. the suits may remain under seal (hence, unknown to the company) for some time while the government decides whether to intervene on behalf of the qui tam plaintiff. such claims are an inevitable part of doing business in the healthcare field today.
the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all statutes, regulations, and other requirements applicable to its commercial laboratory operations and drug development support services. the healthcare diagnostics and drug development industries are, however, subject to extensive regulation, and the courts have not interpreted many of the applicable statutes and regulations. therefore, the applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the company. potential sanctions for violation of these index statutes and regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties, fines, the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, additional liabilities from third-party claims, and/or exclusion from participation in government programs.
the company records an aggregate legal reserve, which is determined using calculations based on historical loss rates and assessment of trends experienced in settlements and defense costs. in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic 450 "contingencies," the company establishes reserves for judicial, regulatory, and arbitration matters outside the aggregate legal reserve if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable and would exceed the aggregate legal reserve. if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. if a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. for more information about legal contingencies, see note 15 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements.

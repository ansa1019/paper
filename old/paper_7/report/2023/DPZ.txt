item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
overview our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks, comprised of three twelve-week quarters and one sixteen-week quarter.
in this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended january 1, 2023. for a discussion of the fiscal year ended january 1, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended january 2, 2022, please refer to part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 1, 2023.
description of the business domino's is the largest pizza company in the world with more than 20,500 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of december 31, 2023, and operates two distinct service models within its stores, with a significant business in both delivery and carryout. we are a highly recognized global brand, and we focus on value while serving neighborhoods locally through our large worldwide network of franchise owners and u.s. company-owned stores through both the delivery and carryout service models. we have been selling quality, affordable food to our customers since 1960. we became "domino's pizza" in 1965 and opened our first franchised store in 1967. over more than 60 years, we have built domino's into one of the most widely-recognized consumer brands in the world. we believe our commitment to value, convenience, quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand.
we are primarily a franchisor, with approximately 99% of domino's global stores owned and operated by our independent franchisees as of december 31, 2023. franchising enables an individual to be a business owner and maintain control over all employment-related matters and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of the domino's global brand and operating system with limited capital investment by us.
domino's business model is straightforward: domino's stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees.
domino's generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees. royalties are ongoing percent-of-sales fees for use of the domino's® brand marks. we also generate revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees through our supply chain operations primarily in the u.s. and canada and by operating a number of company-owned stores in the united states. franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. in our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the domino's pizza® brand to master franchisees. these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they may profit by sub-franchising and selling food and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores. we believe that everyone in the system can benefit from the franchise model, including the end consumer, who can purchase domino's menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically.
domino's business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our company-owned stores. it can also yield significant cash flows to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. at domino's, we believe we have a proven business model for success that has historically driven strong returns for our shareholders.
domino's financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchised and company-owned stores. changes in retail sales are primarily driven by same store sales growth and net store growth. we monitor both of these metrics very closely, as they directly impact our revenues and profits, and we strive to consistently increase both metrics. retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees, as well as company-owned store and supply chain revenues.
critical accounting estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, our management evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-lived assets, casualty insurance reserves and income taxes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from those estimates, and changes in estimates could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period.
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are:
long-lived assets we record long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and capitalized software, at cost. for acquisitions of franchise operations, we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets, historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition. we depreciate and amortize long-lived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us. we evaluate the potential impairment of long-lived assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. our periodic evaluation is based on various analyses, including, on an annual basis, the projection of undiscounted cash flows. if we determine that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable, we compare the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group. for company-owned stores, we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis, which we have determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows. if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset, we estimate the fair value of the asset. if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of company-owned stores during the years presented. same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in determining projected cash flows used to evaluate recoverability of the related assets. if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs, the carrying value of our company-owned stores, by market, may not be recoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge. there were no triggering events in 2023, 2022 or 2021, and accordingly, we did not record any impairment losses on long-lived assets in 2023, 2022 and 2021.
casualty insurance reserves for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001, we maintain insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and owned and non-owned automobile liabilities. we are generally responsible for up to $2.0 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers' compensation and general liability, depending on policy year and line of coverage. we are generally responsible for up to between $500,000 and $5.5 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and non-owned automobile liabilities, depending on policy year and line of coverage. the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates, which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events. there is inherent uncertainty in the ultimate cost for known claims under our insurance coverages, and for incidents that have occurred that will be subject to a claim, but have yet to be reported to us. analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the ultimate claim costs for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date and for claims incurred but not yet reported. when estimating these liabilities, several factors are considered, including the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal cost associated with claims, healthcare trends and projected inflation.
our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented. management believes that the various assumptions developed, and actuarial methods used to determine our casualty insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods. a 10% change in our casualty insurance liability at december 31, 2023 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately $5.6 million in 2023. we had accruals for casualty insurance reserves of $56.3 million and $57.6 million at december 31, 2023 and january 1, 2023, respectively.
income taxes the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate was 21% in each of 2023, 2022 and 2021. our federal income tax provision calculated based on the federal statutory rate was $137.0 million, $120.3 million and $131.4 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. we measure deferred taxes using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, related reserves and deferred taxes. these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets, if necessary. on an ongoing basis, management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. our accounting for deferred taxes represents our best estimate of future events. except with respect to certain foreign tax credits and interest deductibility in separately filed states, our deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, based on our estimates and assumptions. as of december 31, 2023 and january 1, 2023, we had total foreign tax credits of $16.8 million and $13.5 million, respectively, each of which were fully offset with a corresponding valuation allowance. we also had valuation allowances related to interest deductibility in separately filed states of $1.4 million and $1.5 million as of december 31, 2023 and january 1, 2023, respectively. we believe our remaining deferred tax assets will be realized. changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

statistical measures the tables below outline certain statistical measures we utilize to analyze our performance. this historical data is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period.
global retail sales global retail sales is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. global retail sales refers to total worldwide retail sales at company-owned and franchised stores. we believe global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and, in the u.s., advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. we review comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the domino's pizza brand and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. in addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales in the u.s. and canada. as a result, sales by domino's franchisees have a direct effect on the company's profitability. retail sales for franchised stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues. the amounts below are presented in millions of u.s. dollars.

(2)   fiscal 2023 figures exclude the impact of the russia market. including the impact of the russia market, total global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, was 5.2% for fiscal 2023.
same store sales growth same store sales growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. same store sales growth is calculated for a given period by including only retail sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both periods. international same store sales growth is calculated similarly to u.s. same store sales growth. changes in international same store sales are reported on a constant dollar basis, which reflects changes in international local currency sales. same store sales growth for transferred stores is reflected in their current classification.
2023          2022          2021
u.s. company-owned stores                                       + 5.4%        (2.6)%        (3.6)%
u.s. franchise stores                                           + 1.4%        (0.7)%        + 3.9%

international stores (excluding foreign currency impact)        + 1.7%        + 0.1%        + 8.0%
u.s. same store sales increased 1.6% during 2023, rolling over a decrease in u.s. same store sales of 0.8% in 2022. the increase in u.s. same store sales in 2023 was attributable to a higher average ticket per transaction resulting from increases in menu and national offer pricing. international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) increased 1.7% during 2023, rolling over an increase in international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) of 0.1% in 2022. the increase in international same store sales in 2023 was attributable to a higher average ticket per transaction across our international markets.
net store growth net store growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. net store growth is calculated by netting gross store openings with gross store closures during the period. transfers between company-owned stores and franchised stores are excluded from the calculation of net store growth. net store growth during fiscal 2023 reflects the closure of the remaining 159 net stores in the russia market.

russia market on august 21, 2023, our master franchisee that owned and operated domino's pizza® stores in russia announced its intent to file for bankruptcy with respect to the stores in that market. therefore, as of august 21, 2023, we have considered the stores in the russia market to be closed and they are excluded from our ending store count as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. we have presented our statistical measure of global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, for fiscal 2023 excluding the impact of the retail sales from the russia market. the 2023 global retail sales growth measures excluding the russia market are calculated as the growth in retail sales excluding the retail sales from the russia market from both 2023 retail sales and the 2022 retail sales base. we believe the impact of the russia market on our statistical measure of global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, for the fiscal years 2022 and 2021 were immaterial and prior amounts have not been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation. we believe the impact of the russia market on our statistical measure of same store sales growth for the periods presented was immaterial, and we also believe the impact of the russia market on our consolidated statements of income related to international franchise royalties and fee revenues and general and administrative expenses for the periods presented was immaterial. we have not received any royalties and fees from the operations of the russia market subsequent to the russian invasion of ukraine in february 2022.

revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our company-owned stores, royalties and fees and advertising contributions from our u.s. franchised stores, royalties and fees from our international franchised stores and sales of food, equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our u.s. franchised stores and certain international franchised stores. company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in food and commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell.
consolidated revenues decreased $57.8 million, or 1.3%, in 2023 due primarily to lower u.s. company-owned store revenues as a result of the refranchising of 114 u.s. company-owned stores in the fourth quarter of 2022 ("the 2022 store sale") as well as lower supply chain revenues primarily due to a shift in the relative mix of the products we sell. additionally, u.s. franchise advertising revenues decreased as a result of a temporary reduction of 0.25% to the standard 6.0% advertising contribution which was effectuated on march 27, 2023, as well as an increase in advertising incentives related to certain brand promotions. these decreases were partially offset by higher u.s. franchise royalties and fees revenues primarily due to an increase in fees paid by our franchisees for the use of our technology platforms, an increase in the average number of u.s. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth and the 2022 store sale as well as higher same store sales. international franchise royalties and fees revenues also increased as a result of net store growth and higher same store sales. these changes in revenues are described in more detail below.

u.s. company-owned stores revenues from u.s. company-owned store operations decreased $69.6 million, or 15.6%, in 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the average number of u.s. company-owned stores open during the period resulting from the 2022 store sale, but this decrease was partially offset by higher same store sales. u.s. company-owned same store sales increased 5.4% in 2023 and declined 2.6% in 2022.
u.s. franchise royalties and fees revenues from u.s. franchise royalties and fees increased $48.6 million, or 8.7%, in 2023 primarily due to an increase in fees paid by our franchisees for the use of our technology platforms, an increase in the average number of u.s. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth and the 2022 store sale as well as higher same store sales. u.s. franchise same store sales increased 1.4% in 2023 and declined 0.7% in 2022.
u.s. franchise advertising revenues from u.s. franchise advertising decreased $12.1 million, or 2.5%, in 2023 primarily due to a temporary reduction of 0.25% to the standard 6.0% advertising contribution effectuated on march 27, 2023 as well as an increase in advertising incentives related to certain brand promotions. the company recorded approximately $14.5 million more in advertising incentives related to certain brand promotions in 2023 as compared to 2022. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the average number of u.s. franchised stores open during the period as a result of net store growth and the 2022 store sale as well as higher same store sales.
supply chain supply chain revenues decreased $39.7 million, or 1.4%, in 2023 due primarily to a shift in the relative mix of the products we sell. our market basket pricing to stores decreased 0.5% during 2023 which did not have a significant impact on supply chain revenues. the market basket pricing change, a statistical measure utilized by management, is calculated as the percentage change of the market basket purchased by an average u.s. store (based on average weekly unit sales) from our u.s. supply chain centers against the comparable period of the prior year. we believe this measure is important to understanding company performance because as our market basket prices fluctuate, our revenues, cost of sales and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate.
international franchise royalties and fee revenues revenues from international franchise royalties and fees increased $15.1 million, or 5.1%, in 2023 due primarily to an increase in the average number of international franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth and same store sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact). the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $5.8 million in 2023 partially offset the increases in international franchise royalties and fees. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalty revenues, a statistical measure utilized by management, is calculated as the difference in international franchise royalty revenues resulting from translating current year local currency results to u.s. dollars at current year exchange rates as compared to prior year exchange rates. we believe this measure is important to understanding company performance given the significant variability in international franchise royalty revenues that can be driven by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, international same store sales increased 1.7% in 2023 and increased 0.1% in 2022.

consolidated cost of sales consists of u.s. company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. consolidated gross margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased $78.8 million, or 4.8%, in 2023 due primarily to higher global franchise royalty and fee revenues, as well as improved procurement productivity within supply chain. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on gross margin. additionally, as our market basket prices fluctuate, our revenues and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate; however, actual product-level dollar margins remain unchanged.
as a percentage of revenues, the consolidated gross margin increased 2.3 percentage points to 38.6% in 2023 from 36.3% in 2022. company-owned store gross margin increased 1.2 percentage points in 2023 and supply chain gross margin increased 1.3 percentage points in 2023. these changes in gross margin are described in more detail below.

u.s. company-owned store gross margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) decreased $6.3 million, or 9.3%, in 2023 due primarily to the 2022 store sale. as a percentage of store revenues, the u.s. company-owned store gross margin increased 1.2 percentage points in 2023. these changes in store gross margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in additional detail below.
•food costs decreased 2.3 percentage points to 29.1% in 2023 driven primarily by the decrease in the market basket pricing to stores as well as improved sales leverage resulting from increases in menu and national offer pricing.
•labor costs increased 1.1 percentage points to 31.6% in 2023 due primarily to higher wage rates in our u.s. company-owned stores in 2023.

supply chain gross margin increased $33.5 million, or 13.7%, in 2023. as a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain gross margin increased 1.3 percentage points in 2023, primarily due to lower food cost as a result of procurement productivity. this improvement in supply chain gross margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues was partially offset by higher labor costs as a percentage of supply chain revenues.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased $18.0 million, or 4.3%, in 2023 primarily due to higher labor costs.
u.s. franchise advertising expenses u.s. franchise advertising expenses decreased $12.1 million, or 2.5%, in 2023, consistent with the decrease in u.s. franchise advertising revenues as discussed above. u.s. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related u.s. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and other activities that promote the domino's brand, and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes.
refranchising loss/gain during 2023, we refranchised one u.s. company-owned store for proceeds of less than $0.1 million. the pre-tax refranchising loss associated with the sale of the related assets and liabilities, including goodwill, was approximately $0.1 million and was recorded in refranchising loss in our consolidated statements of income.
during 2022, we completed the 2022 store sale in which we refranchised 114 u.s. company-owned stores in arizona and utah for proceeds of $41.1 million. in connection with the 2022 store sale, we recorded a $21.2 million pre-tax refranchising gain on the sale of the related assets and liabilities, including a $4.3 million reduction in goodwill.
other income other income was $17.7 million in 2023, representing the unrealized gains recorded on our investment in dpc dash based on the active exchange quoted price for the equity security. we did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount in fiscal 2022. additional information related to our investment in dpc dash is included in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
interest expense, net interest expense, net, decreased $10.3 million, or 5.3%, in 2023 driven by higher interest income earned on our cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents in 2023. our weighted average borrowing rate was 3.8% in both 2023 and 2022.
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased $12.8 million, or 10.6%, in 2023 due to an increase in income before the provision for income taxes, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. the effective tax rate decreased to 20.4% during 2023, as compared to 21.0% in 2022. the lower effective tax rate in 2023 was driven primarily by higher foreign tax credits. this decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the release of certain unrecognized tax benefits related to one of our foreign subsidiaries during 2022 that did not recur in 2023 and a higher proportion of non-deductible expenses associated with covered officer compensation in 2023 as compared to 2022.
segment income we evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, referred to as segment income. segment income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below. other segment income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs.
in the first quarter of 2023, we changed our allocation methodology for certain costs which support certain internally developed software used across our franchise system. the change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs resulted in an estimated increase in u.s. stores segment income of $65.7 million, an estimated increase in international franchise segment income of $8.9 million and an estimated decrease in other segment income of $74.6 million in 2023. the change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs had no impact on revenues, supply chain segment income or total segment income.

u.s. stores u.s. stores segment income increased $82.4 million, or 18.8%, in 2023, primarily due to the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs, as well as higher u.s. franchise royalties and fees revenues, each as discussed above. these increases were partially offset by the $6.3 million decrease in u.s. company-owned store gross margin, as discussed above. u.s. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on u.s. stores segment income. u.s. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related u.s. franchise advertising revenues are recognized and had no impact on u.s. stores segment income.
supply chain supply chain segment income increased $36.6 million, or 17.5%, in 2023 due primarily to the $33.5 million increase in supply chain gross margin described above.
international franchise international franchise segment income increased $23.5 million, or 9.9%, in 2023, primarily due to higher international franchise royalties and fees revenues as well as the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs, each as discussed above. international franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise segment income.
other other segment income decreased $60.9 million, or 233.9%, in 2023 due primarily to the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs as discussed above, as well as higher labor costs.
new accounting pronouncements the impact of new accounting pronouncements adopted and the estimated impact of new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources historically, our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities resulting in efficient deployment of working capital. we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month. in addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits variations in our working capital requirements. as of december 31, 2023, we had working capital of $67.0 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $200.9 million, advertising fund assets, restricted of $106.3 million and advertising fund liabilities of $104.2 million. working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $114.1 million.
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes. during 2023, we experienced global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, in both our u.s. and international businesses. these factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. in addition to our cash flows from operations, we have two variable funding note facilities. the facilities include our 2022 variable funding notes (defined below), which allows for advances of up to $120.0 million, as well as our 2021 variable funding notes (defined below), which allows for advances of up to $200.0 million and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit (the 2021 variable funding notes and the 2022 variable funding notes, the "2022 and 2021 variable funding notes"). the letters of credit primarily relate to our casualty insurance programs and certain supply chain center leases. as of december 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings and $120.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2022 variable funding notes. as of december 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings and $157.8 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2021 variable funding notes, net of letters of credit issued of $42.2 million.
we expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, any excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our business and other strategic opportunities, repay outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt, pay dividends and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock.
our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a. risk factors. there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our 2022 and 2021 variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our notes (defined below) and to service, extend or refinance our 2022 and 2021 variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
restricted cash as of december 31, 2023, we had $149.1 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $51.6 million of restricted cash equivalents held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $200.9 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. as of december 31, 2023, we also held $88.2 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents which can only be used for activities that promote the domino's brand.
long-term debt
2022 variable funding notes on september 16, 2022, certain of our subsidiaries issued a new variable funding note facility which allows for advances of up to $120.0 million of series 2022-1 variable funding senior secured notes, class a-1 notes (the "2022 variable funding notes"). additional information related to our 2022 variable funding notes is included in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
2021 recapitalization on april 16, 2021, we completed the 2021 recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries issued notes pursuant to an asset-backed securitization. the notes consist of $850.0 million series 2021-1 2.662% fixed rate senior secured notes, class a-2-i with an anticipated term of 7.5 years (the "2021 7.5-year notes") and $1.0 billion series 2021-1 3.151% fixed rate senior secured notes, class a-2-ii with an anticipated term of 10 years (the "2021 ten-year notes", and, collectively with the 2021 7.5-year notes, the "2021 notes"). gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 notes were $1.85 billion.
concurrently, certain of our subsidiaries also issued a new variable funding note facility which allows for advances of up to $200.0 million of series 2021-1 variable funding senior secured notes, class a-1 notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit (the "2021 variable funding notes").

operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased $115.5 million in 2023 primarily due to the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $93.5 million. the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of payments on accrued liabilities, accounts payable and income taxes, as well as the timing and pricing of inventory in 2023 as compared to 2022. additionally, net income increased $66.9 million and non-cash adjustments decreased $9.7 million, resulting in an overall increase to cash provided by operating activities in 2023 as compared to 2022 of $57.2 million. these increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $35.2 million negative impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, in 2023 as compared to 2022 due to payments for advertising activities outpacing receipts from advertising contributions.

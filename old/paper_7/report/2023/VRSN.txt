overview we are a global provider of critical internet infrastructure and domain name registry services, enabling internet navigation for many of the world's most recognized domain names. we help enable the security, stability, and resiliency of the dns and the internet by providing root zone maintainer services, operating two of the thirteen global internet root servers, and providing registration services and authoritative resolution for the .com and .net tlds, which support the majority of global e-commerce.
as of december 31, 2023, we had 172.7 million .com and .net registrations in the domain name base. the number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising, e-commerce, and the number of internet users, which is partially driven by greater availability of internet access, as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars. growth in the number of domain name registrations under our management may be hindered by certain factors, including overall economic conditions, competition from cctlds, other gtlds, services that offer alternatives for an online presence, such as social media, and ongoing changes in the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses. factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users, and how they navigate the internet, as well as the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will manage their investment in domain names, can negatively impact our business and the demand for new domain name registrations and renewals.

critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements:
income taxes we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions in the united states and internationally. tax laws and regulations in these jurisdictions are complex, interrelated, and periodically changing. significant judgment or interpretation of these laws and regulations is often required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, including, for example, the calculations of taxable income in each jurisdiction, deferred taxes, and the availability and amount of deductions and tax credits. we have recognized $301.0 million of deferred tax assets, net as of december 31, 2023. our income tax expense was $158.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2023.
the final taxes payable are also dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from various tax examinations. we only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions and tax benefit amounts that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in an outcome that is materially different from our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits. see note 10, "income taxes" of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information.

revenues our revenues are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the .com and .net domain name registries. we also derive revenues from operating domain name registries and technical systems for several other gtlds and cctlds, all of which are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues. for domain names registered in the .com and .net registries, we receive a fee from registrars per annual registration that is determined pursuant to our agreements with icann. individual customers, called registrants, contract directly with registrars or their resellers, and the registrars, who are our direct customers, in turn register the domain names with verisign. changes in revenues are driven largely by changes in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases, to the extent permitted by icann and the doc. new registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising, e-commerce, and the number of internet users, as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars. we also offer promotional incentive-based discount programs to registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate.
under the .com registry agreement, we are permitted to increase the price of a .com domain name registration by up to 7% in each of the final four years of each six-year period beginning on october 26, 2018. we increased the annual registry-level wholesale fee for each new and renewal .com domain name registration from $8.39 to $8.97 effective september 1, 2022 and from $8.97 to $9.59 effective september 1, 2023. on february 8, 2024, we announced that we will increase the annual registry-level wholesale fee for each new and renewal .com domain name registration from $9.59 to $10.26, effective september 1, 2024. effective february 1, 2023, we increased the annual registry-level wholesale fee for each new and renewal .net domain name registration from $9.02 to $9.92. in june 2023, we entered into a renewal of the .net registry agreement with icann, pursuant to which we will remain the sole registry operator for the .net registry through june 30, 2029. we have the contractual right to increase the fees for .net domain name registrations by up to 10% each year during the term of our agreement with icann, through june 30, 2029. effective february 1, 2024, we increased the annual registry-level wholesale fee for each new and renewal .net domain name registration from $9.92 to $10.91. all fees paid to us for .com and .net registrations are in u.s. dollars.

demand for domain names has been primarily driven by continued internet growth and marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars. however, competitive pressure from cctlds, other gtlds, services that offer alternatives for an online presence, such as social media, ongoing changes in internet practices and behaviors of consumers and business, as well as the motivation of existing domain name registrants managing their investment in domain names, such as for resale at increased prices or for revenue generation through website advertising, and global economic conditions, has limited the demand for domain names and may continue to do so in the future. while the core value proposition for domain names remains strong, softness in demand primarily in china has recently led to a decline in our domain name base.
geographic revenues we generate revenues in the u.s.; europe, the middle east and africa ("emea"); china; and certain other countries, including canada, japan and singapore.

revenues in the table above are attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which our registrars are located; however, this may differ from the regions where the registrars operate or where registrants are located. revenue growth for each region may be impacted by registrars reincorporating, relocating, or from acquisitions or changes in affiliations of resellers. several such changes benefited revenues in the u.s. and negatively impacted revenues in emea during the year ended december 31, 2023. revenue growth for each region may also be impacted by registrars domiciled in one region, registering domain names in another region. the majority of our revenue growth was generated from registrars based in the u.s. and certain other countries, while revenues from registrars based in china declined during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the lower demand noted above.
cost of revenues cost of revenues consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits expenses for our personnel who manage the operational systems, depreciation expenses, operational costs associated with the delivery of our services, fees paid to icann, customer support and training, costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities, telecommunications expense and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead.

cost of revenues decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to decreases in registry fees, depreciation expenses, and telecommunication expenses, partially offset by increases in compensation and benefits expenses and allocated overhead expenses. registry fees decreased by $4.3 million due to the transition of the operation of the registry for the .tv cctld to another service provider in the fourth quarter of 2022. depreciation expenses decreased by $2.7 million due to a decrease in capital expenditures in recent periods, particularly in 2022. telecommunication expenses decreased by $2.5 million primarily due to savings on renewals of colocation agreements. compensation and benefits expenses increased by $3.9 million due to salary increases and an increase in average headcount. allocated overhead expenses increased by $2.4 million due to an increase in total allocable expenses.
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel, including salaries and other personnel-related expenses, consulting fees, facilities costs, computer and communications equipment, support services used in our service and technology development, and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead.

research and development expenses increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to a decrease in capitalized labor and a combination of several other individually insignificant factors. capitalized labor decreased by $2.9 million due to a shift in work from capital projects to certain non-capital projects and maintenance of existing software products.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses for our executive, administrative, legal, finance, information technology, human resources, sales, and marketing personnel, travel and related expenses, trade shows, costs of computer and communications equipment and support services, consulting and professional service fees, costs of marketing programs, costs of facilities, management information systems, support services, and certain tax and license fees, offset by allocations of indirect costs such as facilities and shared services expenses to other cost types.

selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits expenses and several other individually insignificant factors, partially offset by an increase in overhead expenses allocated to other cost types. compensation and benefits expenses increased by $5.4 million due to salary increases and an increase in average headcount. among other individually insignificant factors, expenses related to travel, contractors and professional services and equipment and software, cumulatively increased by $4.7 million. overhead expenses allocated to other cost types increased by $3.0 million due to an increase in total allocable expenses.
interest expense interest expense remained consistent during 2023 compared to 2022.

the effective tax rate for each of the periods in the table above differed from the statutory federal rate of 21% due to state income taxes and u.s. taxes on foreign earnings, net of foreign tax credits, offset by a lower foreign effective tax rate.
during 2023, we recognized $69.3 million of income tax benefits related to a step-up in tax basis of certain non-u.s. intellectual property, recognition of previously unrecognized income tax benefits as the related statutes of limitations lapsed, and a beneficial change in certain state income apportionment rules.
as of december 31, 2023, we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $301.9 million, net of valuation allowances, but before the offset of certain deferred tax liabilities. with the exception of deferred tax assets related to intellectual property, certain state and foreign net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards, we believe it is more likely than not that the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, together with future taxable income, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.

the marketable securities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the u.s. treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy, which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities. the cash equivalents consist of amounts invested in money market funds, time deposits and u.s. treasury bills purchased with original maturities of three months or less. as of december 31, 2023, all of our debt securities have contractual maturities of less than one year. our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible. for additional information on our investment portfolio, see note 2, "financial instruments," of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k.
effective july 27, 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our common stock in the amount of $1.14 billion, in addition to the $356.1 million that remained available for repurchases under the share repurchase program, for a total repurchase authorization of up to $1.50 billion under the program. in 2023, we repurchased 4.2 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $210.28 for an aggregate cost of $882.8 million under our share repurchase program. in 2022, we repurchased 5.5 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $187.07 for an aggregate cost of $1.03 billion. as of december 31, 2023, there was approximately $1.12 billion remaining available for future share repurchases under the share repurchase program.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $750.0 million principal amount outstanding of 2.70% senior unsecured notes due 2031, $550.0 million principal amount outstanding of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due 2027, and $500.0 million principal amount outstanding of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2025. in december 2023, we entered into a new $200.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility which takes the place of our prior unsecured revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility, which will expire in 2028.
we believe existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and funds generated from operations, together with our ability to arrange for additional financing, should be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure requirements, and to service our debt for the next 12 months and beyond. we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs. our most significant future cash requirements include interest and principal payments on the senior notes issuances described above, income tax payments, purchase obligations and registry fees related to the operation of certain top-level domains. these items are detailed in note 11, "commitments and contingencies" of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k.
in summary, our cash flows for 2023, 2022, and 2021 were as follows:

cash flows from operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers. our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures, and other general operating expenses, as well as payments related to taxes, interest and facilities.
net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to increases in cash received from customers and interest on investments, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes and cash paid to employees. cash received from customers increased primarily due to the impact of the .com price increases that were effective on september 1, 2022 and september 1, 2023, changes in customer deposit balances, and the .net price increase that became effective on february 1, 2023. cash received from interest on investments increased due to higher interest rates on our investments in debt securities. cash paid for income taxes increased primarily due to comparatively higher taxable income and higher transition tax payments on accumulated foreign earnings resulting from the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act. cash paid to employees increased primarily due to salary increases.
cash flows from investing activities the cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to purchases, maturities and sales of marketable securities, and purchases of property and equipment.
we had net cash outflows from investing activities in 2023, compared to net cash inflows from investing activities in 2022, primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, net of purchases of marketable securities and an increase in purchases of property and equipment, primarily related to the purchase of a building to be used as our future corporate headquarters.
cash flows from financing activities the cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan.
net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due a decrease in share repurchases.
dilution from rsus grants of stock-based awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. we recognize that these stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages. as of december 31, 2023, there were a total of 0.7 million unvested rsus which represent potential dilution of less than 1.0%. this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding rsus vest and are settled. in recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of rsu grants to employees; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future if and as we use our available cash for other purposes.

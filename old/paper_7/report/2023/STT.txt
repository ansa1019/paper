item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in this form 10-k. certain previously reported amounts presented in this form 10-k have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.
as of december 31, 2023, we had consolidated total assets of $297.26 billion, consolidated total deposits of $220.97 billion, consolidated total shareholders' equity of $23.80 billion and approximately 46,000 employees. through our two lines of business, investment servicing and investment management, we operate in more than 100 geographic markets worldwide, including the united states, canada, latin america, europe, the middle east and asia.
for the description of our lines of business, refer to "lines of business" in item 1 in this form 10-k. for financial and other information about our lines of business, refer to "line of business information" in this management's discussion and analysis and note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.
information about the significant accounting policies that require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods is included under "significant accounting estimates" in this management's discussion and analysis and in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
certain financial information provided in this form 10-k, including this management's discussion and analysis, is presented using both a u.s. gaap, or reported basis, and a non-gaap basis, including certain non-gaap measures used in the calculation of identified regulatory ratios. we measure and compare certain financial information on a non-gaap basis, including information that management uses in evaluating our business and activities. non-gaap financial information should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or as superior to, financial information prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap. any non-gaap financial information presented in this form 10-k, including this management's discussion and analysis, is reconciled to its most directly comparable currently applicable regulatory ratio or u.s. gaap-basis measure. as part of our non-gaap-basis measures, we present a fully taxable-equivalent nii that reports non-taxable revenue, such as interest income associated with tax-exempt investment securities, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, which we believe facilitates an investor's understanding and analysis of our underlying financial performance and trends.
in this management's discussion and analysis, where we describe the effects of changes in foreign currency translation, those effects are determined by applying applicable weighted average fx rates from the relevant 2022 period to the relevant 2023 period results.
this management's discussion and analysis contains statements that are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of u.s. securities laws. these forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. additional information about forward-looking statements and related risks and uncertainties is provided in "forward-looking statements", "risk factors summary" and "risk factors" in this form 10-k.
information regarding additional disclosures and materials available on our website is provided under "additional information" in item 1 in this form 10-k.

(1) in the first quarter of 2022, we reclassified certain fee revenue in our consolidated statement of operations, primarily moving revenues that are not directly associated with software and processing fees to a new other fee revenue line item. in addition, we provided a disaggregation of servicing fees into back office services and middle office services and of software and processing fees into front office software and data and lending related and other fees. prior periods have been revised to reflect these changes.
nm not meaningful fee revenue table 2: total revenue, provides the breakout of fee revenue for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. servicing and management fees collectively made up approximately 72%, 73% and 76% of the total fee revenue in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
servicing fee revenue servicing fees, as presented in table 2: total revenue, decreased 3% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to lower client activity and adjustments, normal pricing headwinds, lower average fixed income markets and a previously disclosed client transition, partially offset by higher average equity market levels and net new business.
servicing fees generated outside the u.s. were approximately 46% of total servicing fees in both 2023 and 2022.
servicing fee revenue comprises revenue from a range of services provided to our clients, including certain alpha servicing mandates, consisting of core custody services, accounting, reporting and administration, which we refer to collectively as back office services and middle office services. the nature and mix of services provided and the asset classes for which the services are performed affect our servicing fees. the basis for fees will differ across regions and clients. generally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors, including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net new business and the manner in which we price our services. for servicing fees for which we have not yet issued an invoice to our clients as of period end, we include an estimate of the impact of changes in market valuations, client activity and flows, net new business and changes in pricing in our revenues.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations changes in market valuations our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our auc/a. increases or decreases in market valuations have a corresponding impact on the level of our auc/a and servicing fee revenues, though the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geography of assets held within our clients' portfolios. for certain asset classes where the valuation process is more complex, including alternative investments, or where our valuation is dependent on third party information, auc/a is reported on a time lag, typically one-month. for those asset classes, the impact of market levels on our reported auc/a, and therefore servicing fee revenue, does not reflect current period-end market levels.
over the five years ended december 31, 2023, we estimate that worldwide equity and fixed income market valuations impacted our servicing fees revenue by approximately 2% on average with a range of (4)% to 8% annually and approximately 1% and (4)% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the impact of changes in worldwide fixed income markets on our servicing fees, which historically was included within client activity and asset flows, is now reflected within change in market valuations. see table 3: daily averages, month-end averages and year-end equity indices for selected indices. while the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. in addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.
assuming that all other factors remain constant, including client activity, asset flows and pricing, we estimate, using relevant information as of december 31, 2023, that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 3%. we estimate, similarly assuming all other factors remain constant and using relevant information as of december 31, 2023, that changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets, have a smaller corresponding impact on our servicing fee revenues on average and over time. in periods of higher fixed income market volatility such as we have been experiencing since the second quarter of 2022, the impact of fixed income markets on our servicing fee revenues may increase.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations client activity and asset flows client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including fx settlements, equity and derivative trades, and wire transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. our servicing fee revenues are impacted by a number of factors, including transaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities.
our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations. over the five years ended december 31, 2023, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fees revenue by approximately (1)% on average with a range of (3)% to 1% annually and approximately (3)% and 0% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. as noted under "changes in market valuations" in this section, this analysis now excludes, but in prior reporting previously included, the impact of changes in worldwide fixed income markets on our servicing fees. see table 5: industry asset flows for selected asset flow information. while the asset flows presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our flows may differ from those market trends. in addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.

net new business over the five years ended december 31, 2023, net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately 0% on average with a range of 0% to 1% annually and approximately 1% in both 2023 and 2022.
gross investment servicing mandates were $904 billion of auc/a in 2023 and $1.80 trillion of auc/a per year on average over the five years ended december 31, 2023, ranging from approximately $0.79 trillion to $3.52 trillion of auc/a annually in any given year.
servicing fee revenue associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install the assets, and the types of assets installed.
revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed. our installation timeline, in general, can range from 6 to 36 months, with the average installation timeline being approximately 9 to 12 months over the past 2 years. we expect that our more complex installations, including new state street alpha mandates, will generally be on the longer end of the 6 to 36 month range. with respect to the current asset mandates of approximately $2.30 trillion of auc/a that are yet to be installed as of december 31, 2023, we expect the conversion will occur over the coming 24 months, with approximately 70-80% expected to be installed in 2024, with the remaining expected to be installed throughout 2025 and 2026. the expected timing of these installations is subject to change due to a variety of factors, including adjusted implementation schedules agreed with clients, scope adjustments, and product and functionality changes.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pricing the industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today. consequently, no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing auc/a wins, as the amount of revenue associated with auc/a, once installed, can vary materially. on average, over the five years ended december 31, 2023, we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately (3)% annually, with the impact ranging from (2)% to (4)% in any given year and approximately (2)% in both 2023 and 2022. pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may benefit us, such as extending the term of our relationship with the client, expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide. the timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional services and the amount of revenue generated, may differ from expectations due to the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboard those new services or process changes, the nature of those services and client investment practices and other factors. these same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when we win business from new clients.
historically, and based on an indicative sample of revenue, we estimate that approximately 60%, on average, of our servicing fee revenues have been variable due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of auc/a; another approximately 15%, on average, of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume of activity in the funds we serve; and the remaining approximately 25% of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values.
based on the impact of the above, client activity and asset flows, net new business and pricing, noted drivers of our servicing fee revenue will vary depending on the mix of products and services we provide to our clients. the full impact of changes in market valuations and the volume of activity in the funds may not be fully reflected in our servicing fee revenues in the periods in which the changes occur, particularly in periods of higher volatility.

(1) certain previously reported amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.
(2) consistent with past practice, auc/a values for certain asset classes are based on a lag, typically one-month.
(3) geographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix.
asset servicing mandates newly announced in 2023 totaled approximately $904 billion of auc/a. servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately $2.30 trillion as of december 31, 2023, which will be reflected in auc/a in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods. the full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period.
new asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive agreements, approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary regulatory approvals. new asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted, but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond state street corporation | 68
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations one quarter. these excluded assets, which from time to time may be significant, will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission. servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis based on factors present on or about the time we determine the business to be won by us and are not updated based on subsequent developments, including changes in assets, market valuations, scope and, potentially, termination. such assets therefore do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us, which may from time to time be significant.
with respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed we may provide various services, including back office services such as custody and safekeeping, transaction processing and trade settlement, fund administration, reporting and record keeping, security servicing, fund accounting, middle office services such as investment book of records, transaction management, loans, cash derivatives and collateral services, recordkeeping, client reporting and investment analytics, markets services such as fx trading services, liquidity solutions, currency and collateral management and securities finance, and front office services such as portfolio management solutions, risk analytics, scenario analysis, performance and attribution, trade order and execution management, pre-trade compliance and esg investment tools. revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the timing of installation, and the types of assets.
as previously disclosed, in early 2021, due to a decision to diversify providers, one of our large asset servicing clients is moving a significant portion of its etf assets currently with state street to one or more other providers. prior to the commencement of the transition of assets, which began in 2022, we estimated that the financial impact of this transition represented approximately 1.9% of our 2021 total fee revenue. we began to see the impact of the transition on our fee revenue and income growth trends primarily towards the end of 2023, with the remainder expected to be realized through 2025 as the transition continues. on a quarterly run rate basis, we estimate that the fourth quarter of 2023 reflects approximately half of the revenue impact of the exiting business. on a full year basis, we estimate that 2023 reflects approximately a fourth of the revenue impact of the exiting business. we expect to continue as a significant service provider for this client after this transition and for the client to continue to be meaningful to our business.
management fee revenue management fees decreased 3% in 2023 compared to 2022, as the previously disclosed shift of certain management fees into nii, client insourcing and the impacts of a strategic etf product suite repricing initiative were partially offset by higher average equity market levels.
management fees generated outside the u.s. were approximately 26% of total management fees in both 2023 and 2022.
management fees generally are affected by our level of aum, which we report based on month-end valuations. management fees for certain components of managed assets, such as etfs, mutual funds and undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities, are affected by daily average valuations of aum. management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue. while certain management fees are directly determined by the values of aum and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors, including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients.
asset-based management fees for passively managed products, to which our aum is currently primarily weighted, are generally charged at a lower fee on aum than for actively managed products. actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable account's performance.
in light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of december 31, 2023 and assuming that all other factors remain constant, including the impact of business won and lost and client flows, that:
•a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 5%; and
•changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets, will have a significantly smaller corresponding impact on our management fee revenues on average and over time.
state street corporation | 69
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations daily averages, month-end averages and year-end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee revenue. year-end indices affect the values of aum as of those dates. see table 3: daily averages, month-end averages and year-end equity indices for selected indices. while the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. in addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.

foreign exchange trading services foreign exchange trading services revenue, as presented in table 2: total revenue, decreased 8% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily reflecting lower direct fx spreads, a decline in market volatility and lower client fx volumes. foreign exchange trading services revenue comprises revenue generated by fx trading and revenue generated by brokerage and other trading services, which made up 63% and 37%, respectively, of foreign exchange trading services revenue in 2023, and 68% and 32%, respectively in 2022.
we primarily earn fx trading revenue by acting as a principal market-maker through both "direct sales and trading" and "indirect fx trading."
•direct sales and trading: represent fx transactions at negotiated rates with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly. clients are able to choose their own execution time and method, trading by voice or electronically on one of the several available multibank platforms. these principal market-making activities include transactions for funds serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those funds under custody with us.
•indirect fx trading: represents fx transactions with clients, for which we are the funds' custodian, or their investment managers, routed to our fx desk through our asset-servicing operation. we execute indirect fx trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients. indirect fx is designed to address fx trades that relate to the purchase, sale or holding of a security where clients chose their execution frequency (either hourly or once per day), allowing us to offer straight-through processing and a fully automated service.
our fx trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume and type of client fx transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting market conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest rate and other market risks associated with our fx activities. the relative impact of these factors on our total fx trading revenues often differs from period to period. for example, assuming all other factors remain constant, increases or decreases in volumes or bid-offer spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases, as the case may be, in client-related fx revenue.
our clients that utilize indirect fx trading can, in addition to executing their fx transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect fx trading to either direct sales and trading execution, including our "street state street corporation | 71
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fx" service, or to one of our electronic trading platforms. street fx, in which we continue to act as a principal market-maker, enables our clients to define their fx execution strategy and automate the fx trade execution process, both for funds under custody with us as well as those under custody at another bank.
we also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue through "electronic fx services" and "other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue."
•electronic fx services: our clients may choose to execute fx transactions through one of our electronic trading platforms. these transactions generate revenue through a "click" fee.
•other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue: as our clients look to us to enhance and preserve portfolio values, they may choose to utilize our transition or currency management capabilities or transact with our equity trade execution group. these transactions, which are not limited to foreign exchange, generate revenue via commissions charged for trades transacted during the management of these portfolios.
fund connect is another one of our electronic trading platforms: it is a global trading, analytics and cash management tool with access to more than 400 money market funds from leading providers.
securities finance securities finance revenue, as presented in table 2: total revenue, increased 2% in 2023 compared to 2022, as higher prime services revenue and higher agency spreads were partially offset by lower agency balances.
our securities finance business consists of three components:
(1) an agency lending program for state street global advisors managed investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives, which we refer to as the state street global advisors lending funds;
(2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers and asset owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and
(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we refer to as our prime services business.
securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which is composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan, the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our share of the fee split.
as principal, our prime services business borrows securities from the lending client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the subsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. we act as principal when the lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and execute the transaction and furnish the securities. in our role as principal, we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. while we source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from third parties, we have the ability to source securities through assets under custody from clients who have designated us as an eligible borrower.
market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance, and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending activities in future periods. in addition, the constantly evolving regulatory environment, including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards, interpretations of those standards, and our own balance sheet management activities, may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency lending or prime services businesses, the volume of our securities lending activity and related revenue and profitability in future periods.
software and processing fees software and processing fees revenue, presented in table 2: total revenue, increased 3% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to higher front office software and data revenue associated with crd.
software and processing fees revenue includes diverse types of fees and revenue, including fees from software licensing and maintenance and fees from our structured products business.
front office software and data revenue, which primarily includes revenue from crd, alpha data platform and alpha data services, increased 5% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher software-enabled and professional services revenue, partially offset by lower on-premises renewals.
revenue related to the front office solutions provided by crd is primarily driven by the sale of term software licenses and saas, including professional services such as consulting and implementation services, software support and maintenance. approximately 50%-70% of revenue associated with a sale of software to be installed on-premises is recognized at a point in time when the customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software license, with the percentage varying based on the length of the contract and other contractual terms. the state street corporation | 72
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations remainder of revenue for on-premise installations is recognized over the length of the contract as maintenance and other services are provided. upon renewal of an on-premises software contract, the same pattern of revenue recognition is followed with 50%-70% recognized upon renewal and the remaining balance recognized over the term of the contract. revenue for a saas related arrangement, where the customer does not take possession of the software, is recognized over the term of the contract as services are provided. upon renewal of a saas arrangement, revenue continues to be recognized as services are provided under the new contract. as a result of these differences in how portions of crd revenue are accounted for, crd revenue may vary more than other business units quarter to quarter.
lending related and other fees decreased 3% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by the municipal finance and stable value wrap business. lending related and other fees primarily consists of fee revenue associated with our fund finance, leveraged loans, municipal finance, insurance and stable value wrap businesses.
other fee revenue other fee revenue includes market-related adjustments and income associated with other equity method investments.
other fee revenue increased $181 million in 2023, compared to 2022, primarily driven by a previously disclosed tax credit investment accounting change and the positive impact of market-related adjustments, partially offset by lower fair value adjustments on equity investments and the impact of the argentine peso devaluation. for further information on the tax credit investment accounting change, please refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
additional information about fee revenue is provided under "line of business information" included in this management's discussion and analysis.
net interest income see table 2: total revenue, for the breakout of interest income and interest expense for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.
nii is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. interest-earning assets, which principally consist of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, loans, resale agreements and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
nim represents the relationship between annualized fte nii and average total interest-earning assets for the period. it is calculated by dividing fte nii by average interest-earning assets. revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly earned from certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is adjusted to a fte basis using the u.s. federal and state statutory income tax rates.
nii on an fte basis increased 8% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates, partially offset by lower average deposit balances and deposit mix shift towards interest-bearing deposits.
investment securities' net purchase premium amortization, which is included in interest income, was $3 million in 2023, compared to $225 million in 2022 and $556 million in 2021. the decrease in net purchase premium amortization in 2023, as compared to 2022, was primarily driven by a shift in the non-mbs portfolio from a net unamortized purchase premium as of december 31, 2022 to a net unamortized purchase discount as of december 31, 2023, as well as reduced prepayment rates on the mbs portfolio due to higher interest rates.
interest income related to debt securities is recognized in our consolidated statement of income using the effective interest method, or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life of the security. the rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as well as purchase premiums or discounts, resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly. the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are adjusted for prepayments when they occur, which primarily impact mortgage-backed securities.
the following table presents the investment securities net premium amortization (discount accretion) for the periods indicated:

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations changes in the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below. additional information about the components of interest income and interest expense is provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
average total interest-earning assets were $231.02 billion in 2023 compared to $247.23 billion in 2022. the decrease is primarily due to lower client deposit balances.
interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $69.88 billion in 2023 compared to $76.50 billion in 2022. these deposits primarily reflect our maintenance of cash balances at the federal reserve, the european central bank (ecb) and other non-u.s. central banks. the lower levels of average cash balances reflect lower levels of client deposits.
securities purchased under resale agreements averaged $1.76 billion in 2023 compared to $2.12 billion in 2022. as a member of ficc, we may net securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under resale agreements with counterparties that are also members of the clearing organization, when specific netting criteria are met. the impact of balance sheet netting was $140.36 billion on average in 2023 compared to $71.02 billion in 2022, primarily driven by an increase in ficc repo volumes.
we are a direct and sponsoring member of ficc. as a sponsoring member within ficc, we enter into repurchase and resale transactions in eligible securities with sponsored clients and with other ficc members and, pursuant to ficc government securities division rules, submit, novate and net the transactions. we may sponsor clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with ficc, backed by our guarantee to ficc of the prompt and full payment and performance of our sponsored member clients' respective obligations. we generally obtain a security interest from our sponsored clients in the high quality securities collateral that they receive, which is designed to mitigate our potential exposure to ficc.
additionally, as a member of ficc, we may be required to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization and provide liquidity support in the event of the default of another member to the extent that the defaulting member's clearing fund obligation and the prescribed loss allocation to ficc is depleted. it is difficult to estimate our maximum possible exposure under the membership agreement, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against us that have not yet occurred. we did not record any liabilities under these arrangements as of both december 31, 2023 and 2022.
average investment securities decreased to $105.77 billion in 2023 from $111.93 billion in 2022. the portfolio declined across major asset classes, which was primarily driven by a smaller balance sheet from lower client deposits amidst a higher level of market rates.
loans averaged $34.80 billion in 2023 compared to $35.12 billion in 2022. average core loans, which exclude overdrafts and highlight our efforts to grow our lending portfolio, averaged $30.97 billion in 2023 compared to $29.10 billion in 2022. the increase is primarily due to growth in clos in loan form and consumer real estate loans, partially offset by a decline in leveraged loans. additional information about these loans is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
average other interest-earning assets, largely associated with our prime service business, decreased to $18.10 billion in 2023 from $20.85 billion in 2022, primarily driven by a decrease in the level of cash collateral posted. other interest-earning assets primarily reflects prime services assets where cash has been posted to borrow securities from lenders, which are then lent by us, as principal, to borrowers. this cash includes both cash from borrowers and cash utilized from our balance sheet, and is presented on a net basis on the balance sheet where we have enforceable netting agreements. non-interest earning assets also included a portion of our prime service assets where borrower-provided non-cash collateral has been utilized to borrow securities from lenders, which we subsequently loan, as principal, to our borrowers; in this structure our investment portfolio securities are encumbered, but this is not reflected on the balance sheet. combined with our prime services liabilities, revenue from these activities generates securities finance fee revenue as well as net interest income.
aggregate average total interest-bearing deposits decreased to $172.89 billion in 2023 from $175.09 billion in 2022. the decrease is driven by the higher market interest rate environment across most major currencies and quantitative tightening, partially offset by our focus on deposit-raising initiatives and rotation from non-interest bearing deposits. future deposit levels will be influenced by the underlying asset servicing business, client behavior, the mix of interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits and market conditions, including the general levels of u.s. and non-u.s. interest rates.
average short-term borrowings decreased to $1.12 billion in 2023 from $1.19 billion in 2022.
average long-term debt was $17.36 billion in 2023 compared to $14.13 billion in 2022. these amounts reflect issuances, redemptions and state street corporation | 75
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations maturities of senior debt during the respective periods.
average other interest-bearing liabilities, largely associated with our prime services business, were $3.89 billion in 2023 compared to $2.73 billion in 2022. other interest-bearing liabilities is primarily driven by cash received from our custody clients, which is presented on a net basis where we have enforceable netting agreements. non-interest bearing liabilities also include a portion of our prime services liabilities where client provided non-cash collateral has been received and we have rehypothecation rights. securities received as collateral from our custody clients where we have no rehypothecation rights are used as a credit mitigant only and remain off balance sheet.
several factors could affect future levels of nii and nim, including the volume and mix of client deposits and funding sources; central bank actions; balance sheet management activities; changes in the level and slope of u.s. and non-u.s. interest rates; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations of those standards; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured and changes in the type and amount of credit or other loans we extend.
based on market conditions and other factors, including regulatory standards, we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated u.s. and non-u.s. securities, such as federal agency mbs, sovereign debt securities and u.s. treasury and agency securities. the pace at which we reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions, the implementation of regulatory standards, including interpretation of those standards and other factors over time. we expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to impact our reinvestment program and future levels of nii and nim.
provision for credit losses in 2023, we recorded a $46 million provision for credit losses, compared to $20 million in 2022, primarily reflecting an increase in loan loss reserves associated with commercial real estate.

expenses table 15: expenses, provides the breakout of expenses for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. total expenses increased 9% compared to 2022, primarily reflecting the impact of the 2023 notable items, higher salaries and continued business investments, partially offset by productivity savings. notable items totaling $620 million, including $387 million associated with the fdic special assessment and $203 million of repositioning charges, contributed to the increase in total expenses in 2023 relative to 2022.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations servicing fees servicing fees, as presented in table 17: investment servicing line of business results, decreased 3% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to lower client activity and adjustments, normal pricing headwinds, lower average fixed income markets and a previously disclosed client transition, partially offset by higher average equity market levels and net new business.
for additional information about servicing fees and the impact of worldwide equity and fixed-income valuations on our fee revenue, as well as other key drivers of our servicing fee revenue, refer to "fee revenue" in "consolidated results of operations" included in this management's discussion and analysis.
expenses total expenses for investment servicing increased 2% in 2023 compared to 2022, as expense growth from higher salaries, headcount and continued business investments were partially offset by productivity and optimization savings. seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense and payroll taxes were $131 million in 2023 compared to $143 million in 2022. additional information about expenses is provided under "expenses" in "consolidated results of operations" included in this management's discussion and analysis.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition the structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our investment servicing and investment management lines of business. our clients' needs and our operating objectives determine the volume, mix and currency denomination of our assets and liabilities. as our clients execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize deposits and short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities. these liabilities are generally in the form of interest-bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term investment alternatives for our clients.
deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational deposits. our assets consist primarily of securities held in our afs or htm portfolios and short-duration financial instruments, such as interest-bearing deposits with banks and securities purchased under resale agreements. the actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.
additional information on our financial condition is presented in table 14: average balances and interest rates - fully taxable-equivalent basis. we believe the average statement of condition is a better measure of the balance sheet trends as period-end balances can be impacted by the timing of client activities including deposits and withdrawals.

(1) domestic and foreign categorization is based on the borrower's country of domicile.
(2) fund finance loans include primarily $9.69 billion private equity capital call finance loans, $6.63 billion loans to real money funds and $1.05 billion loans to business development companies as of december 31, 2023, compared to $7.57 billion and $9.15 billion private equity capital call finance loans, $6.61 billion and $6.40 billion loans to real money funds and $1.11 billion and $1.39 billion loans to business development companies as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
(3) includes $2.23 billion securities finance loans, $276 million loans to municipalities and $5 million other loans as of december 31, 2023, $1.51 billion securities finance loans, $321 million loans to municipalities and $42 million other loans as of december 31, 2022 and $1.78 billion securities finance loans, $455 million loans to municipalities and $23 million other loans as of december 31, 2021.
(4) as of december 31, 2023, excluding overdrafts, floating rate loans totaled $31.42 billion and fixed rate loans totaled $2.94 billion. we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the forecasted cash flows associated with euribor indexed floating-rate loans. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional details.
the increase in domestic loans was primarily driven by an increase in fund finance loans and other loans, partially offset by lower overdrafts, and the increase in foreign loans was primarily driven by fund finance loans and collateralized loan obligations in loan form as of december 31, 2023 compared to december 31, 2022.
as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, our leveraged loans totaled approximately $3.61 billion and $3.55 billion, respectively. we sold $519 million of leveraged loans in 2023.
in addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of december 31, 2023 and 2022 of $121 million and $98 million, respectively, to participate in syndications of leveraged loans. additional information about these unfunded commitments is provided in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
these leveraged loans, which are primarily rated "speculative" under our internal risk-rating framework (refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k), are externally rated "bbb," "bb" or "b," with approximately 92% and 96% of the loans rated "bb" or "b" as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. our investment strategy involves generally limiting our investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major global financial institutions, applying our internal credit analysis process to each potential investment and diversifying our exposure by counterparty and industry segment. however, these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans in our portfolio.
as of december 31, 2023, the commercial real estate portfolio consists of, by asset class, approximately 37% multifamily residential, 35% office buildings and 28% other asset classes, and the portfolio does not have any construction exposure. additionally, as of december 31, 2023, the commercial real estate loans are on properties located in multiple markets across the united states, with no significant concentrations (new york metro is the largest concentration at approximately 16%).
additional information about all of our loan segments, as well as underlying classes, is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.

(1) the provision for credit losses is primarily related to commercial and financial loans.
(2) the charge-offs are related to commercial and financial loans.
(3) consists primarily of foreign currency translation.
in 2023, we recorded a $46 million provision for credit losses, compared to $20 million in 2022, primarily reflecting an increase in loan loss reserves associated with commercial real estate.
as of december 31, 2023, approximately $72 million of our allowance for credit losses was related to leveraged loans included in the commercial and financial segment and $60 million was related to commercial real estate loans, compared to $73 million and $19 million as of december 31, 2022, respectively. the remaining $18 million and $29 million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was related to other loans, off-balance sheet commitments, interest-bearing deposits with banks and other financial assets held at amortized cost, including investment securities. as of december 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses represented 0.4% of total loans.
as our view on current and future economic conditions changes, our allowance for credit losses related to these loans may be impacted through a change to the provisions for credit losses, reflecting factors such as credit migration within our loan portfolio, as well as changes in management's economic outlook.
additional information with respect to the allowance for credit losses, net impairment losses and gross unrealized losses related to investment securities, is provided in "allowance for credit losses" under significant accounting estimates and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
risk management overview in the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some that are inherent in the financial services industry, and others that are more specific to our business activities. our risk management framework focuses on material risks, which include the following:
•credit and counterparty risk;
•liquidity risk, including funding and management;
•operational risk;
•information technology risk;
•operational resiliency risk;
•market risk associated with our trading activities;
•market risk associated with our non-trading activities, referred to as asset and liability management, consisting primarily of interest rate risk;
•model risk;
•strategic risk; and
•reputational, compliance, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
many of these risks, as well as certain factors underlying each of them, could affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements, and are discussed in detail under "risk factors" in this form 10-k.
the identification, assessment, monitoring, mitigation and reporting of risks are essential to our financial performance and successful management of our businesses. accordingly, the scope of our business requires that we consider these risks as part of a comprehensive and well-integrated risk management function.
these risks, if not effectively managed, can result in losses to us as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. our approach to risk management, including board and senior management oversight and a system of policies, procedures, limits, risk measurement and monitoring and internal controls, allows for an assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital that appropriately balances risk and return.
our objective is to optimize our returns while operating at a prudent level of risk. in support of this objective, we have instituted a risk appetite framework that aligns our business strategy and financial objectives with the level of risk that we are willing to incur.
we manage risk with a focus on the following objectives:
•a culture of risk awareness that extends across all of our business activities;
•the identification, classification and quantification of our material risks;
state street corporation | 84
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•the establishment of our risk appetite and associated limits and policies, and our compliance with these limits;
•the establishment of a risk management structure at the "top of the house" that enables the control and coordination of risk-taking across the business lines;
•the implementation of stress testing practices and a dynamic risk-assessment capability (additional information with respect to our stress-testing process and practices is provided under "capital" in this management's discussion and analysis);
•a direct link between risk and strategic-decision making processes and incentive compensation practices; and
•the overall flexibility to adapt to the ever-changing business and market conditions.
our risk appetite framework outlines the quantitative limits and qualitative goals that define the level and type of risk we are willing to undertake in the course of executing our business strategy, and also serves as a guide in setting risk limits across our business units. it further defines responsibilities for measuring and monitoring risk against limits, and for reporting, escalating, approving and addressing exceptions. our risk appetite framework is established by erm, a corporate risk oversight group, in conjunction with the mrac and the rc of the board. the board formally reviews and approves our risk appetite statement annually, or more frequently in response to shifts in endogenous or exogenous risk conditions.
governance and structure our approach to risk management involves all levels of management, from the board and its committees, including its examining and audit committee (e&a committee), the rc, the human resources committee (hrc) and the tops, to each business unit and employee. we allocate responsibility for risk oversight so that risk/return decisions are made under a process designed to place appropriate personnel in positions of decision-making authority and subject to robust review and challenge.
risk management is the responsibility of each employee, and is implemented through three lines of defense:
•the business units, which own and manage the risks inherent in their business, are considered the first line of defense;
•erm and other support functions, such as compliance, finance and vendor management, provide the second line of defense; and
•corporate audit is the third line of defense, reports to the e&a committee of the board and is independent from the business units, erm and other corporate functions. corporate audit provides independent assurance to the board over the design and operating effectiveness of key internal controls included within the risk management framework.
the responsibilities for effective review and challenge reside with senior managers, management oversight committees, corporate audit and, ultimately, the board and its committees.
corporate-level risk committees provide focused oversight, and establish corporate standards and policies for specific risks, including credit, sovereign exposure, market, liquidity, operational, information technology as well as new business products, regulatory compliance and ethics, vendor risk and model risks. these committees have been delegated the responsibility to develop recommendations and remediation strategies to address issues that affect or have the potential to affect us.
we maintain a risk governance committee structure which serves as the formal governance mechanism through which we seek to undertake the consistent identification, management and mitigation of various risks facing us in connection with our business activities. this governance structure is enhanced and integrated through multi-disciplinary involvement, particularly through erm. the following chart presents this structure.
while our risk management program is designed to manage the risks in our businesses, internal and external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations enterprise risk management the goal of erm is to ensure that risks are proactively identified, well-understood and prudently managed in support of our business strategy. erm provides risk oversight, support and coordination to allow for the consistent identification, measurement and management of risks across business units separate from the business units' activities, and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of corporate-wide risk management policies and guidelines.
risk identification and assessments serve to enable erm's understanding of business unit strategy, risk profile, and potential exposures and support the management of risk. this is achieved through a series of risk assessments across our business using techniques for the identification, assessment, and measurement of risk across a spectrum of potential frequency and severity combinations, including business-specific programs to identify, assess and measure risk, such as new business and product review and approval, new client screening, and, as deemed appropriate, targeted risk assessments. two primary risk assessment programs, which are supplemented by other business-specific programs, are the core of this component:
•the material risk identification process utilizes a bottom-up approach to identify our most significant risk exposures across on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities. the program is designed to consider risks that could have a material impact irrespective of their likelihood or frequency. this can include risks that may have an impact on longer-term business objectives, such as significant change management activities or long-term strategic initiatives.
•the risk and control assessment program. see also "operational risk management" below.
in addition, erm establishes and reviews limits and, in collaboration with business unit management, monitors key risks. ultimately, erm works to validate that risk-taking occurs within the risk appetite statement approved by the board and conforms to associated risk policies, limits and guidelines.
the chief risk officer (cro) is responsible for our risk management globally, leads erm and has a dual reporting line to our ceo and the board's rc.
board committees the board has four committees which assist it in discharging its responsibilities with respect to risk management: the rc, the e&a committee, the hrc and the tops.
•the rc is responsible for oversight related to the operation of our global risk management framework, including policies and procedures establishing risk management governance and processes and risk control infrastructure. it is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our assessment and management of all risks applicable to our operations, including credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, regulatory, technology, business, compliance and reputation risks, and related policies. in addition, the rc provides oversight of capital policies, capital planning and balance sheet management, resolution planning and monitors capital adequacy in relation to risk. it is also responsible for discharging the duties and obligations of the board under applicable basel and other regulatory requirements.
•the e&a committee oversees management's operation of our comprehensive system of internal controls covering the integrity of our consolidated financial statements and reports, compliance with laws, regulations and corporate policies. the e&a committee acts on behalf of the board in monitoring and overseeing the performance of corporate audit and in reviewing certain communications with banking regulators. the e&a committee has direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention, evaluation and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm, including sole authority for the establishment of pre-approval policies and procedures for all audit engagements and any non-audit engagements.
•the hrc has direct responsibility for the oversight of human capital management, all compensation plans, policies and programs in which executive officers participate and incentive, retirement, welfare as well as equity plans in which certain of our other employees participate. in addition, it oversees the alignment of our incentive compensation arrangements with our safety and soundness, including the integration of risk management objectives, and related policies, arrangements and control processes consistent with applicable related regulatory rules and guidance.
•the tops leads and assists in the board's oversight of technology and operational risk management and the role of these risks, including cyber risk, in executing our strategy and supporting our global business state street corporation | 87
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations requirements. the tops reviews strategic initiatives from a technology and operational risk perspective and reviews and approves technology-related risk matters. in addition, the tops reviews matters related to corporate information security and cybersecurity programs, and their related risks, operational and technology resiliency, data and access management and third-party risk management.
executive management committees mrac is the senior management decision-making body for risk and capital issues, and oversees our financial risks, our consolidated statement of condition, and our capital adequacy, liquidity and recovery and resolution planning. its responsibilities include:

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit risk management core policies and principles we define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower or obligor, collectively referred to as a counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms. we assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as overdrafts, loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio, where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in our direct and indirect trading activities, such as securities purchased under a resale agreement, principal securities lending and fx and indemnified agency securities lending. we also assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other settlement operations, in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central banks or private sector institutions and fees receivables.
we distinguish between three major types of credit risk:
•default risk - the risk that a counterparty fails to meet its contractual payment obligations;
•country risk - the risk that we may suffer a loss, in any given country, due to any of the following reasons: deterioration of economic conditions, political and social upheaval, nationalization and appropriation of assets, government repudiation of indebtedness, exchange controls and disruptive currency depreciation or devaluation; and
•settlement risk - the risk that the settlement or clearance of transactions will fail, which arises whenever the exchange of cash, securities or other assets is not simultaneous.
the acceptance of credit risk by us is governed by corporate policies and guidelines, which include standardized procedures applied across the entire organization. these policies and guidelines include specific requirements related to each counterparty's risk profile; the markets served; counterparty, industry and country concentrations; and regulatory compliance. these policies and procedures also implement a number of core principles, which include the following:
•we measure and consolidate credit risks attributed to each counterparty, or group of counterparties, in accordance with a "one-obligor" principle that aggregates risks across our business units;
•erm reviews and approves all material extensions of credit, and material changes to such extensions of credit (such as changes in term, collateral structure or covenants), in accordance with assigned credit-approval authorities;
•credit-approval authorities are assigned to individuals according to their qualifications, experience and training, and these authorities are periodically reviewed. our largest exposures require approval by the credit committee, a sub-committee of the cmrc. with respect to small and low-risk extensions of credit to certain types of counterparties, approval authority may be granted to individuals outside of erm;
•we seek to avoid or limit undue concentrations of risk. counterparty (or groups of counterparties), industry, country and product-specific concentrations of risk are subject to frequent review and approval in accordance with our risk policies and appetite;
•we evaluate the creditworthiness of counterparties through a detailed risk assessment, including the use of internal risk-rating methodologies;
•we review all extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of counterparties at least annually. the nature and extent of these reviews are determined by the size, nature and term of the extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of the counterparty; and
•we subject all corporate policies and guidelines to annual review as an integral part of our periodic assessment of our risk appetite.
our corporate policies and guidelines require that all extensions of credit are consistent with the bank's standards, limit credit-related losses, and our goal of maintaining a strong financial condition.
structure and organization the credit risk group within erm is responsible for the assessment, approval and monitoring of credit risk across our business. the group is managed centrally, has dedicated teams in a number of locations worldwide, and is responsible for related policies and procedures, and for our internal credit-rating systems and methodologies. in addition, the group, in conjunction with the business units, establishes measurements and limits to control the amount of credit risk accepted across its various business activities, both at the portfolio level and for each individual counterparty or group of state street corporation | 90
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations counterparties, to individual sectors, and also to counterparties by product and country of risk. these measurements and limits are reviewed periodically, but at least annually.
in conjunction with other groups in erm, the credit risk group is responsible for the design, implementation and oversight of our credit risk measurement and management systems, including data and assessment systems, quantification systems and the reporting framework.
various key committees within our company are responsible for the oversight of credit risk and associated credit risk policies, systems and models. all credit-related activities are governed by our risk appetite framework and our credit risk guidelines, which define our general philosophy with respect to credit risk and the manner in which we control, manage and monitor such risks.
the previously described cmrc (refer to "risk committees") has primary responsibility for the oversight, review and approval of the credit risk guidelines and policies. credit risk guidelines and policies are reviewed periodically, but at least annually.
the credit committee, a sub-committee of the cmrc, has responsibility for assigning credit authority and approving the largest and higher-risk extensions of credit to individual counterparties or groups of counterparties.
cmrc provides periodic updates to mrac and the board's rc.
credit ratings we perform initial and ongoing reviews to exercise due diligence on the creditworthiness of our counterparties when conducting any business with them or approving any credit limits.
this due diligence process generally includes the assignment of an internal credit rating, which is determined by the use of internally developed and validated methodologies, scorecards and a 15-grade rating scale. this risk-rating process incorporates the use of risk-rating tools in conjunction with management judgment; qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a replicable manner and, following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on our rating scale is assigned. we generally rate our counterparties individually, although some counterparties defined by us as low-risk are rated on a pooled basis. credit ratings are reviewed and approved by the credit risk group or its delegates. we evaluate and rate the credit risk of our counterparties on an ongoing basis. to facilitate comparability across the portfolio, counterparties within a given sector are rated using a risk-rating tool developed for that sector.
our risk-rating methodologies are approved for use by the trading markets committee, a subcommittee of the cmrc, after completion of internal model validation processes, and are subject to an annual review, including re-validation.
risk parameter estimates our internal risk-rating system promotes a clear and consistent approach to determining appropriate credit risk classifications for our credit counterparties and exposures. this allows us to track the changes in risk associated with these counterparties and exposures over time. this capability enhances our ability to calculate both risk exposures and capital, and enables better strategic decision making across the organization.
more specifically, our internal risk rating system is used for the following purposes:
•the assessment of the creditworthiness of new counterparties and, in conjunction with our risk appetite statement, the development of appropriate credit limits for our products and services, including loans, foreign exchange, securities finance, placements and repurchase agreements;
•the automation of limit approvals for certain low-risk counterparties, as defined in our credit risk guidelines and based on the counterparty's probability-of-default;
•the development of approval authority matrices based on pd; riskier counterparties with higher pds require higher levels of approval for a comparable pd and limit size compared to less risky counterparties with lower pds;
•the analysis of risk concentration trends using historical pd and exposure-at-default (ead), data;
•the determination of the level of management review of short-duration advances depending on pd; riskier counterparties with higher rating class values generally trigger higher levels of management escalation for comparable short-duration advances compared to less risky counterparties with lower rating-class values;
•the monitoring of credit facility utilization levels using ead values and the identification of instances where counterparties have exceeded limits;
•the aggregation and comparison of counterparty exposures with risk appetite levels to determine if businesses are maintaining appropriate risk levels; and state street corporation | 91
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•the determination of our regulatory capital requirements for the airb set forth in the basel framework.
credit risk mitigation we seek to limit our credit exposure and reduce any potential credit losses through the use of various types of credit risk mitigation. the basel iii final rule permits us to reflect the application of credit risk mitigation when it meets the standards outlined therein. examples of forms of credit risk mitigation include a security interest in financial and non-financial assets (collateral), netting and guarantees. where permissible, we apply the recognition of collateral, guarantees and netting to mitigate overall risk within our counterparty credit portfolio. while credit default swaps are permitted under the basel iii final rule, we do not actively use credit default swaps as a risk mitigation tool.
collateral in many parts of our business, we regularly require or agree for collateral to be received from or provided to clients and counterparties in connection with contracts that involve credit risk. in our trading businesses, this collateral is typically in the form of cash, as well as highly-rated and/or liquid securities (i.e. government securities and other bonds or equity securities). credit risks in our non-trading and securities finance businesses are also often secured by bonds and equity securities and by other types of assets. collateral serves to reduce the risk of loss inherent in an exposure. however, changing market values of the collateral we hold, unexpected increases in the credit exposure to a client or counterparty, reductions in the value or change in the type of securities held by us, as well as operational errors or errors in the manner in which we seek to exercise our rights, may reduce the risk mitigation effects of collateral. while collateral is often an alternative source of repayment, it does not replace the requirement within our policies and guidelines for high-quality underwriting. we also may choose to incur credit exposure without the benefit of collateral or other risk mitigating credits rights.
our credit risk guidelines require that the collateral we accept for risk mitigation purposes is of high quality, can be reliably valued and is supported by a valid security interest that permits liquidation if or when required. generally, when collateral is of lower quality, more difficult to value or more challenging to liquidate, higher discounts to market values are applied for the purposes of measuring credit risk. for certain less liquid collateral, longer liquidation periods are assumed when determining the credit exposure.
all types of collateral are assessed regularly by erm, as is the basis on which the collateral is valued. our assessment of collateral, including the ability to liquidate collateral in the event of a counterparty default, and also with regard to market values of collateral under a variety of hypothetical market conditions, is an integral component of our assessment of risk and approval of credit limits. we also seek to identify, limit and monitor instances of "wrong-way" risk, where a counterparty's risk of default is positively correlated with the risk of our collateral eroding in value.
we maintain policies and procedures requiring that documentation used to collateralize a transaction is legal, valid, binding and enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions. we also conduct legal reviews to assess whether our documentation meets these standards on an ongoing basis.
netting netting is a mechanism that allows institutions and counterparties to net offsetting exposures and payment obligations against one another through the use of qualifying master netting agreements. a master netting agreement allows for certain rights and remedies upon a counterparty default, including the right to net obligations arising under derivatives or other transactions under such agreement. in such an event, the netting of obligations would result in a single net claim owed by, or to, the counterparty. this is commonly referred to as "close-out netting," and is pursued wherever possible. we may also enter into master agreements that allow for the netting of amounts payable on a given day and in the same currency, reducing our settlement risk. this is commonly referred to as "payment netting," and is widely used in our foreign exchange activities.
as with collateral, we have policies and procedures in place to apply close-out and payment netting only to the extent that we have verified legal validity and enforceability of the master agreement. in the case of payment netting, operational constraints may preclude us from reducing settlement risk, notwithstanding the legal right to require the same under the master netting agreement. in the event we become unable, due to operational constraints, actions by regulators, changes in accounting principles, law or regulation (or related interpretations) or other factors, to net some or all of our offsetting exposures and payment obligations under those agreements, we would be required to gross up our assets and liabilities on our statement of condition and our calculation of rwa, accordingly. this would result in a potentially material change in our regulatory ratios, including lcr, and present increased credit, liquidity, asset-and-liability management and operational risks, some of which could be material.
guarantees a guarantee is a financial instrument that results in credit support being provided by a third party, (i.e., state street corporation | 92
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the protection provider) to the underlying obligor (the beneficiary of the provided protection) on account of an exposure owing by the obligor. the protection provider may support the underlying exposure either in whole or in part. support of this kind may take different forms. typical forms of guarantees provided to us include financial guarantees, letters of credit, bankers' acceptances, purchase undertaking agreement contracts and insurance.
we have established a review process to evaluate guarantees under the applicable requirements of our policies and basel iii requirements. governance for this evaluation is covered under policies and procedures that require regular reviews of documentation, jurisdictions and credit quality of protection providers.
credit limits central to our philosophy for our management of credit risk is the approval and imposition of credit limits, against which we monitor the actual and potential future credit exposure arising from our business activities with counterparties or groups of counterparties. credit limits are a reflection of our risk appetite, which may be determined by the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the nature of the risk inherent in the business undertaken with the counterparty, or a combination of relevant credit factors. our risk appetite for certain sectors and certain countries and geographic regions may also influence the level of risk we are willing to assume to certain counterparties.
the analysis and approval of credit limits is undertaken similarly across our businesses, although the nature and extent of the analysis may vary, based on the type, term and magnitude of the risk being assumed. credit limits and underlying exposures are assessed and measured on both a gross and net basis where appropriate, with net exposure determined by deducting the value of any collateral held. for certain types of risk being assumed, we will also assess and measure exposures under a variety of hypothetical market conditions. credit limit approvals across our business are undertaken by the credit risk group, by individuals to whom credit authority has been delegated, or by the credit committee.
credit limits are re-evaluated annually, or more frequently as needed, and are revised periodically on prevailing and anticipated market conditions, changes in counterparty or country-specific credit ratings and outlook, changes in our risk appetite for certain counterparties, sectors or countries, and enhancements to the measurement of credit utilization.
reporting ongoing active monitoring and management of our credit risk is an integral part of our credit risk management framework. we maintain management information systems to identify, measure, monitor and report credit risk across businesses and legal entities, enabling erm and our businesses to have timely access to information on credit limits and exposures. monitoring is performed along the dimensions of counterparty, industry, country and product-specific risks to facilitate the identification of concentrations of risk and emerging trends.
key aspects of this credit risk reporting structure include governance and oversight groups and policies that define standards for the reporting of credit risk, data aggregation and sourcing systems.
the credit risk group routinely assesses the composition of our overall credit risk portfolio for alignment with our stated risk appetite. this assessment includes routine analysis and reporting of the portfolio, monitoring of market-based indicators, the assessment of industry trends and developments and regular reviews of concentrated risks. the credit risk group is also responsible, in conjunction with the business units, for defining the appetite for credit risk in the major sectors in which we have a concentration of business activities. these sector-level risk appetite statements, which include counterparty selection criteria and granular underwriting guidelines, are reviewed periodically and approved by the cmrc.
monitoring regular surveillance of credit and counterparty risks is undertaken by our business units, the credit risk group and designees with erm, allowing for oversight. this surveillance process includes, but is not limited to, the following components:
•annual reviews. a formal review of counterparties is conducted at least annually and includes a review of operating performance, primary risk factors and our internal credit risk rating. this annual review also includes a review of current and proposed credit limits, an assessment of our ongoing risk appetite and assessment that supporting legal documentation remains effective.
•interim monitoring. monitoring of our largest and riskiest counterparties is undertaken more frequently, utilizing financial information, market indicators and other relevant credit and performance measures. the nature and extent of this interim monitoring is individually tailored to certain counterparties and/or industry sectors to identify material changes to the risk profile of a counterparty (or group of counterparties)
state street corporation | 93
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and assign an updated internal risk rating in a timely manner.
we maintain an active "surveillance list" for all counterparties. the surveillance list status denotes a concern with some aspect of a counterparty's risk profile that warrants closer monitoring of the counterparty's financial performance and related risk factors. our ongoing monitoring processes are designed to facilitate the early identification of counterparties whose creditworthiness is deteriorating; any counterparty may be placed on the surveillance list by erm at its sole discretion.
counterparties on the surveillance list generally correspond with the non-investment grade or near non-investment grade ratings established by the major independent credit-rating agencies. the surveillance list also includes any counterparties rated "special mention," "substandard," "doubtful" and "loss."
the credit risk group maintains primary responsibility for our surveillance list processes, and generates a quarterly report of all surveillance list counterparties. the surveillance list is formally reviewed at least on a quarterly basis, with participation from senior credit risk staff, and representatives from the business units and our corporate finance and legal groups as appropriate. these meetings include a review of individual surveillance list counterparties, together with credit limits and prevailing exposures, and are focused on actions to contain, reduce or eliminate the risk of loss to us. identified actions are documented and monitored.
controls gcr provides a separate level of surveillance and oversight over the integrity of our credit risk management processes, including the internal risk-rating system. gcr reviews counterparty credit ratings for all identified sectors on an ongoing basis. gcr is subject to oversight by the cmrc, and provides periodic updates to the board's rc.
specific activities of gcr include the following:
•perform separate and objective assessments of our credit and counterparty exposures to determine the nature and extent of risk undertaken by the business units;
•execute periodic credit process and credit product reviews to assess the quality of credit analysis, compliance with policies, guidelines and relevant regulation, transaction structures and underwriting standards, and risk-rating integrity;
•identify and monitor developing counterparty, market and/or industry sector trends to limit risk of loss and protect capital;
•deliver regular and formal reporting to stakeholders, including exam results, identified issues and the status of requisite actions to remedy identified deficiencies;
•allocate resources for specialized risk assessments (on an as-needed basis); and
•liaise with assurance partners and regulatory personnel on matters relating to risk rating, reporting and measurement.
allowance for credit losses we record an allowance for credit losses related to certain on-balance sheet credit exposures, including our financial assets held at amortized cost, as well as certain off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded commitments and letters of credit. review and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is based, among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio and the estimated effects of our forecasts on our counterparties. we utilize multiple economic scenarios, consisting of a baseline, upside and downside scenarios, to develop our forecast of expected losses.
in 2023, the majority of the increase in the allowance estimate reflected an increase in reserves for the commercial real estate portfolio, with management's economic outlook and the leveraged loan portfolio remaining relatively stable. allowance estimates are subject to uncertainties, including those inherent in our model and economic assumptions, and management may use qualitative adjustments. if future data and forecasts deviate relative to the forecasts utilized to determine our allowance for credit losses as of december 31, 2023, or if credit risk migration is higher or lower than forecasted for reasons independent of the economic forecast, our allowance for credit losses will also change.
additional information about the allowance for credit losses is provided in notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
liquidity risk management our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk to our liquidity based on our activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. in managing liquidity risk we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicators and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. this process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the state street corporation | 94

we manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis as well as on a stand-alone basis at our parent company and at certain branches and subsidiaries of state street bank. state street bank generally has access to markets and funding sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds market, and the federal reserve's discount window and the bank term funding program. the parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. additionally, the parent company typically holds, or has direct access to, primarily through ssif, a direct subsidiary of the parent company, and the support agreement, as discussed in "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k, cash and equivalents intended to meet its current debt maturities and other cash needs, as well as those projected over the next twelve-month period. absent financial distress at the parent company, the liquid assets available at ssif continue to be available to the parent company. as of december 31, 2023, the value of our parent company's net liquid assets totaled $659 million, compared with $460 million as of december 31, 2022, excluding available liquidity through ssif. as of december 31, 2023, our parent company and state street bank had approximately $0.98 billion of senior notes or subordinated debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months.
as a sifi, our liquidity risk management activities are subject to heightened and evolving regulatory requirements, including interpretations of those requirements, under specific u.s. and international regulations and also resulting from published and unpublished guidance, supervisory activities, such as stress tests, resolution planning, examinations and other regulatory interactions. satisfaction of these requirements could, in some cases, result in changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, reduced nii or nim, a reduction in the level of certain business activities or modifications to the way in which we deliver our products and services. if we fail to meet regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could receive negative regulatory stress test results, incur a resolution plan deficiency or determination of a non-credible resolution plan or otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding. our efforts to satisfy, or our failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
governance global treasury is responsible for our management of liquidity. this includes the day-to-day management of our global liquidity position, the development and monitoring of early warning indicators, key liquidity risk metrics, the creation and execution of stress tests, the evaluation and implementation of regulatory requirements, the maintenance and execution of our liquidity guidelines and contingency funding plan (cfp), and routine management reporting to alco, mrac and the board's rc.
global treasury risk management, part of erm, provides separate oversight over the identification, communication and management of global treasury's risks in support of our business strategy. global treasury risk management reports to the cro. global treasury risk management's responsibilities relative to liquidity risk management include the development and review of policies and guidelines; the monitoring of limits related to adherence to the liquidity risk guidelines and associated reporting.
liquidity framework we manage liquidity according to several principles that are equally important to our overall liquidity risk management framework:
•structural liquidity management addresses liquidity by monitoring and directing the composition of our consolidated statement of condition. structural liquidity is measured by metrics such as the percentage of total wholesale funds to consolidated total assets, and the percentage of non-government investment securities to client deposits. in addition, on a regular basis and as described below, our structural liquidity is evaluated under various stress scenarios.
•tactical liquidity management addresses our day-to-day funding requirements and is largely driven by changes in our primary source of funding, which are client deposits. fluctuations in client deposits may be supplemented with short-term borrowings, repurchase agreements, fhlb products and certificates of deposit.
•stress testing and contingent funding planning are longer-term strategic liquidity risk management practices. regular and ad hoc liquidity stress testing are performed under various severe but plausible scenarios at the consolidated level and at significant subsidiaries, including state street bank. these tests contemplate severe market and events specific to us under various time horizons and severities. tests contemplate the impact of material changes in key funding sources, credit ratings, additional collateral requirements, contingent uses of funding, systemic shocks to the financial markets and state street corporation | 95
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operational failures based on market and assumptions specific to us. the stress tests evaluate the required level of funding versus available sources in an adverse environment. as stress testing contemplates potential forward-looking scenarios, results also serve as a trigger to activate specific liquidity stress levels and contingent funding actions.
cfps are designed to assist senior management with decision-making associated with any contingency funding response to a possible or actual crisis scenario. the cfps define roles, responsibilities and management actions to be taken in the event of deterioration of our liquidity profile caused by either an event specific to us or a broader disruption in the capital markets. specific actions are linked to the level of stress indicated by these measures or by management judgment of market conditions.
liquidity risk metrics in managing our liquidity, we employ early warning indicators and metrics intended to detect situations which may result in a liquidity stress, including changes in our stock price and spreads on our long-term debt. additional metrics that are critical to the management of our consolidated statement of condition and monitored as part of our routine liquidity management include measures of our fungible cash position, purchased wholesale funds, unencumbered liquid assets, deposits and the total of investment securities and loans as a percentage of total client deposits.
asset liquidity central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists primarily of hqla. hqla is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the lcr. as a banking organization, we are subject to a minimum lcr under the lcr rule approved by u.s. banking regulators. the lcr is intended to promote the short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations, like us, to improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. the lcr measures an institution's hqla against its net cash outflows. hqla primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid securities that qualify for inclusion under the lcr rule. net cash outflows are measured as prescribed under the lcr rule which provides a significant benefit for deposits classified as operational. we report the lcr to the federal reserve daily. for both the quarters ended december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, average daily lcr for the parent company was 106%. the impact of higher deposits on the parent company's lcr is limited by a cap, known as the transferability restriction, on the hqla from state street bank that can be recognized at the parent company as defined in the u.s. lcr final rule. this restriction limits the hqla used in the calculation of the parent company's lcr to the amount of net cash outflows of its principal banking subsidiary (state street bank). the average hqla, post-prescribed haircuts for the parent company under the lcr final rule definition was $128.96 billion for the quarter ended december 31, 2023 compared to $139.88 billion for the quarter ended december 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in client deposits relative to the prior period. for the quarter ended december 31, 2023, the lcr for state street bank was approximately 122%.
in addition, we are subject to the final rule issued by the u.s. banking agencies implementing the basel committee on banking supervision's (bcbs's) nsfr in the u.s. which became effective on july 1, 2021. the final rule requires large banking organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is a weighted measure of a company's funding sources over a one-year time horizon, calculated by applying standardized weightings to the company's equity and liabilities based on their expected stability. the amount of stable funding can be no less than the amount of required stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets, derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics. as a u.s. g-sib, we are required to maintain an nsfr that is equal to or greater than 100%. pursuant to the bcbs's nsfr final rule, as a subsidiary of a u.s. g-sib, state street bank is similarly required to maintain an nsfr that is equal to or greater than 100%. as of december 31, 2023, both the parent company's and state street bank's nsfr were above the 100% minimum nsfr requirement. the average nsfr for the parent company was 136% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 132% for the third quarter of 2023.
we maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the federal reserve of approximately $69.28 billion at the federal reserve, the ecb and other non-u.s. central banks for the quarter ended december 31, 2023, and $79.52 billion for the quarter ended december 31, 2022. the higher levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect higher levels of client deposits.
liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the federal reserve bank of boston (frbb), the fhlb, and other non-u.s. central banks. state street bank is a member of the fhlb. this membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management.
state street corporation | 96
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations access to primary, intraday and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying conditions. as of december 31, 2023, we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the frbb discount window, $1 billion outstanding of bank term funding program and $2.5 billion outstanding of fhlb funding. as of december 31, 2022, we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the frbb discount window or any other central bank facility and $2.0 billion outstanding borrowings from the fhlb.
in addition to the investment securities included in our asset liquidity, we have other unencumbered investment securities and certain loans that we can pledge as collateral to access these various facilities. these additional assets are available sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our lcr asset liquidity.
the average fair value of total unencumbered securities was $76.86 billion for the quarter ended december 31, 2023, compared to $78.25 billion for the quarter ended december 31, 2022.
measures of liquidity include lcr and nsfr, which are described in "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k.
uses of liquidity significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals of client deposits; draw-downs by our custody clients of lines of credit; advances to clients to settle securities transactions; increases in our investment and loan portfolios; or other permitted purposes. such circumstances would generally arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. a recurring use of our liquidity involves our deployment of hqla from our investment portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our prime services program.
we had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts totaling $34.20 billion and $31.20 billion and standby letters of credit totaling $1.51 billion and $2.13 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. these amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral. as of december 31, 2023, approximately 75% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit and 35% of our standby letters of credit expire within one year. since many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.
information about our resolution planning and the impact actions under our resolution plans could have on our liquidity is provided in "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k.
funding deposits we provide products and services including custody, accounting, administration, daily pricing, fx services, cash management, financial asset management, securities finance and investment advisory services. as a provider of these products and services, we generate client deposits, which have generally provided a stable, low-cost source of funds. as a global custodian, clients place deposits with our entities in various currencies. as of december 31, 2023, approximately 70% of our average total deposit balances were denominated in u.s. dollars, 15% in eur, 5% in gbp and 10% in all other currencies. as of december 31, 2022, 65% of our average total deposit balances were denominated in u.s. dollars, 15% in eur, 10% in gbp and 10% in all other currencies.
short-term funding our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy. these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. in addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors. as discussed earlier under "asset liquidity," state street bank's membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral.
short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase. these transactions are short-term in nature, generally overnight and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities. these balances were $1.87 billion and $1.18 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
state street bank continues to maintain a line of credit with a financial institution of cad $1.40 billion, or approximately $1.06 billion, as of december 31, 2023, to support its canadian securities processing operations. the line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancellable by either party with prior notice. as of both december 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations long-term funding we have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business needs. in addition, state street bank also has current authorization from the board to issue unsecured senior debt. the total amount remaining for issuance pursuant to this authority is $2.15 billion as of december 31, 2023.
on january 26, 2023, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.857% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2026 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.821% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2034.
on may 18, 2023, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.104% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2026 and $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.159% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2034.
on august 3, 2023, we issued $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.272% fixed rate senior notes due 2026 and $300 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2026.
on november 21, 2023, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.684% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2029 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.123% fixed-to-floating rate senior subordinated notes due 2034.
on december 3, 2023, we redeemed $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.776% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2024.
agency credit ratings our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by major credit rating agencies.

•diverse and stable core earnings;
•relative market position;
•strong risk management;
•strong capital ratios;
•diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client deposits;
•strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and
•preparedness for current or future regulatory developments.
high ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:
•providing confidence for unsecured funding and depositors;
•increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products;
•facilitating reduced collateral haircuts in secured lending transactions; and
•engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings.
a downgrade or reduction in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets, which could increase the related cost of funds. in turn, this could cause the sudden and large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to drawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments; or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts.
a majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. we assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a downgrade by major rating agencies. the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified in the agreements is provided in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k. other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operational risk management overview operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.
in providing an array of products and services, we are exposed to operational risk. operational risk may result from, but is not limited to, errors relating to transaction processing, breaches of internal control systems, or business interruption due to system failures or other events. operational risk also includes potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a byproduct of our failure to maintain and execute an adequate system of internal control. in the case of an operational risk event, we could suffer financial loss and potential regulatory action, as well as reputational damage.
unforeseen external events, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, pandemics, global conflicts, or other geopolitical events (including the ongoing war in ukraine and the israel-hamas war), may result in stress on the operating environment and increase operational risk.
operational risk encompasses fiduciary risk and legal risk. fiduciary risk is defined as the risk that we fail to properly exercise our fiduciary duties in our provision of products or services to clients. legal risk is the risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with laws and contractual obligations.
operational risk is inherent in the performance of investment servicing and investment management activities on behalf of our clients. whether it be fiduciary risk, risk associated with execution and processing or other types of operational risk, a consistent, transparent and effective operational risk framework is key to identifying, monitoring and managing operational risk. to mitigate these risks, we have established policies, procedures, an internal control standards and an operational risk framework. controls are designed to manage operational risk at levels appropriate to our business model, the business environment and the markets in which we operate taking into account factors such as regulation and competition.
the organizational framework for operational risk is based on risk management activities comprising:
•governance: we have established governance structures to oversee and assess our operational risk management activities and our operational risk policy;
•accountability: business managers are responsible for maintaining an effective system of internal controls commensurate with their risk profiles and in accordance with state street policies and procedures. operational risk management is the second line function responsible for developing risk management policies and tools for assessing, measuring and monitoring operational risk; and
•operational risk management framework: an established operational risk management framework supports and drives the identification, assessment, mitigation and monitoring of operational risk.
governance our board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall operational risk policy.
our operational risk policy establishes our approach to our management of operational risk across our business. the policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of operational risk, and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the operational risk framework.
executive management manages and oversees our operational risk through membership on risk management committees, including torc and the operational risk and controls committee, each of which ultimately reports to a committee of the board.
the operational risk and controls committee, chaired by the global head of operational risk, oversees the operational risk framework and policies, reviews and monitors program outputs and metrics, and monitors resolution of significant operational risk matters.
accountability accountability for managing operational risk spans the first and second lines of defense:
•the global head of operational risk, a member of the cro's executive management team, leads erm's corporate orm group. orm is responsible for developing risk management policies and tools for assessing, measuring, monitoring and managing operational risk. the orm function includes risk oversight of all line of business and functions; and
•business managers are responsible for managing day to day operations, maintaining an effective system of internal controls and managing operational risks within risk appetite in its normal course of business.
corporate audit, as a third line of defense, performs separate reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies utilized across our business.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operational risk management framework the operational risk management framework has been established in a structured manner to drive the identification, assessment, mitigation and monitoring of operational risk. operational risk management framework includes key elements such as risk and control self assessment, capital analysis, monitoring and reporting and documentation and guidelines. these framework components are described below.
risk and control self assessment the objective of the risk and control self assessment program is to proactively identify, assess and manage operational risks and related controls associated with day-to-day operations. a key component of understanding how risks are managed is to understand the effectiveness of controls. effectiveness of controls is concluded through testing, both internal and external, business control assurance activities and self-assessments along with other control function reviews, such as a sox testing program.
capital analysis the primary measurement tool used to quantify operational risk capital and rwa related to operational risk under the advanced approaches is the loss distribution approach (lda) model. such required capital and rwa totaled $3.50 billion and $43.77 billion, respectively, as of december 31, 2023, compared to $3.42 billion and $42.76 billion, respectively, as of december 31, 2022; refer to the "capital" section in "financial condition," of this management's discussion and analysis.
the lda model incorporates the three required operational risk elements described below:
•internal loss event data is collected from across our business in conformity with our operating loss policy that establishes the requirements for collecting and reporting individual loss events;
•external loss event data from other financial institutions supplements our internal loss data pool with respect to loss event severity; and
•business environment and internal control factors are those characteristics of a bank's internal and external operating environment that bear an exposure to operational risk.
monitoring and reporting the objective of risk monitoring is to proactively monitor the changing business environment and corresponding operational risk exposure. it is achieved through monitoring tools that are designed to help us to understand changes in the business environment, internal control factors, risk metrics, risk assessments, exposures and operating effectiveness, as well as details of loss events and progress on risk initiatives implemented to mitigate potential risk exposures.
operational risk reporting is intended to provide transparency, thereby enabling management to manage risk, provide oversight and escalate issues in a timely manner. it is designed to allow the business units, executive management, and the board's control functions and committees to gain insight into activities that may result in risks and potential exposures.
documentation and guidelines documentation and guidelines allow for consistency and repeatability of the various processes that support the operational risk framework across our business.
operational risk guidelines document our practices and describe the key elements in a business unit's operational risk management program. the purpose of the guidelines is to set forth and define key operational risk terms, provide further detail on our operational risk programs, and detail the business units' responsibilities to identify, assess, measure, monitor and report operational risk. the guideline supports our operational risk policy.
data standards have been established with the intent of maintaining consistent data repositories and systems that are controlled, accurate and available on a timely basis to support operational risk management.
information technology risk management overview and principles we define information technology risk as the risk associated with the use, ownership, operation and adoption of information technology. information technology risk includes risks potentially triggered by non-compliance with regulatory obligations, information security or cyber incidents, internal control and process gaps, operational events and adoption of new business technologies.
the principal technology risks within our risk policy and risk appetite framework include:
•third party risk;
•business disruption and technology resiliency risk;
•technology change management risk;
•cyber and information security risk;
•technology asset and configuration risk; and
•technology obsolescence risk.
governance our board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall technology risk framework and program. it does so through its tops, which state street corporation | 101
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reviews and approves our risk policy and appetite framework annually as well as our cybersecurity policy and related standards.
our risk policy establishes our approach to our management of technology risk across our business. the policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of technology risk and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the risk framework.
risk control functions in the business are responsible for adopting and executing the risk framework and reporting requirements. they do this, in part, by developing and maintaining an inventory of critical applications and supporting infrastructure, as well as identifying, assessing and measuring technology risk. they are also responsible for monitoring and evaluating risk on a continual basis using key risk indicators, risk reporting and adopting appropriate risk responses to risk issues.
enterprise technology risk management (etrm) is the separate risk function responsible for the technology risk strategy and appetite, and technology risk framework development and execution. etrm also performs overall technology risk monitoring and reporting to the board, and provides a separate view of the technology risk posture to executive leadership.
we manage technology risks by:
•coordinating various risk assessment and risk management activities, including erm operational risk programs;
•establishing, through torc and tops of the board, the enterprise level technology risk and cyber risk appetite and limits;
•producing enterprise level risk reporting, aggregation, dashboards, profiles and risk appetite statements;
•validating appropriateness of reporting of information technology and cybersecurity risks and risk acceptance to senior management risk committees and the board;
•promoting a strong technology and cybersecurity risk culture through communication;
•serving as an escalation and challenge point for risk policy guidance, expectations and clarifications;
•assessing effectiveness of key enterprise information technology and cybersecurity risk and internal control remediation programs; and
•providing risk oversight, challenge and monitoring for the enterprise continuity services function and third party management program, including the collection of risk appetite, metrics and key risk indicators, and reviewing issue management processes and consistent program adoption.
cybersecurity risk management cybersecurity risk is managed as part of our overall information technology risk, as outlined above under the direction of our chief information security officer (ciso). our ciso is an executive vice president at state street and is responsible for our overall information security program.
before joining state street, our ciso worked at a global information technology firm for more than 10 years, holding various positions, including senior vice president and chief security officer, and, prior to that, chief information security officer for that firm's software division. earlier on, she held leadership and general manager roles at an information management firm and an information security firm, each based in both the united states and europe. she has worked with the world economic forum as a member of their global future council on cybersecurity. she holds a doctor of philosophy in information security and a bachelor of science in computer science.
we recognize the significance of cyber-attacks and take steps to mitigate the risks associated with them. we invest in building and maintaining a mature cybersecurity program to leverage people, technology and processes to protect our systems and the data in our care. we have also implemented a program to help us better measure and manage cybersecurity risk, including those risks we face when we engage third parties for products and services.
we design our information and systems access restrictions referencing the national institute of standards and technology 800 53r4 framework and use the supplemental requirements as implementation guidance. our information security policies and standards are reviewed and updated with the onset of new regulatory changes and/or mandates. these standards are applicable to all corporate functions, business units, subsidiaries and controlled affiliates across the enterprise. annual audits are conducted by internal and external parties to measure compliance and adherence to the standards.
all employees and third parties that have access to our systems or networks are required to adhere to our cybersecurity policy and standards. our centralized information security group provides education and training. this training includes a required annual online training class for all employees and third parties that have access to our systems or networks, multiple simulated phishing attacks and regular information security awareness materials.
state street corporation | 102
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations every employee and contractor has a defined role in protecting systems and information of state street, our clients and others. they are responsible for complying with the information security program, reporting suspected violations and threats; and protecting the confidentiality of information assets of us, our clients and others at all times.
we employ information security officers to help the business better understand and manage their information security risks, as well as to work with the centralized gcs team to drive awareness and compliance throughout the business.
we use independent third parties to perform ethical hacks of key systems and penetration tests of our network and certain applications to help us better understand the effectiveness of our controls and to implement more effective controls, and we engage with third parties to conduct reviews of our overall program to help us better align our cybersecurity program with what is required of a large financial services organization.
we have an incident response program in place that is designed to enable a coordinated response to mitigate the impact of cyber-attacks, recover from the attack and to drive the appropriate level of communication to internal and external stakeholders, including timely reporting of material incidents in accordance with sec rules.
the torc assesses and manages the effectiveness of our cybersecurity program, which is overseen by the tops of our board. the tops receives regular cybersecurity updates throughout the year and is responsible for reviewing and approving the policy on an annual basis.
market risk management market risk is defined by u.s. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. we are exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or asset-and-liability management, activities.
information about the market risk associated with our trading activities is provided below under "trading activities." information about the market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interest rate risk, is provided below under "asset-and-liability management activities."
trading activities in the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity needs, our clients' requirements, market volatility and our execution against those factors.
we engage in trading activities primarily to support our clients' needs and to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity. in connection with certain of these trading activities, we enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our clients' needs and to manage our interest rate and currency risk. these activities are generally intended to generate foreign exchange trading services revenue and to manage potential earnings volatility. in addition, we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets.
our clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. with the growth of cross-border investing, our clients often enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios. as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward and option contracts in support of these client needs, and act as a dealer in the currency markets.
as part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward contracts and interest rate futures. as of december 31, 2023, the notional amount of these derivative contracts was $2.57 trillion, of which $2.54 trillion was composed of foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. we seek to match positions closely with the objective of mitigating related currency and interest rate risk. all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates.
governance our assumption of market risk in our trading activities is an integral part of our corporate risk appetite. the rc of the board reviews and oversees our management of market risk, including the approval of key market risk policies and the receipt and review of regular market risk reporting, as well as periodic updates on selected market risk topics.
the previously described cmrc (refer to "risk committees") oversees all market risk-taking activities across our business associated with trading. the cmrc, which reports to mrac, is composed of members of erm, our global markets business and our global treasury group, as well as our senior executives who manage our trading businesses and other members of management who possess specialized knowledge. the cmrc meets regularly to monitor the management of our trading market risk activities.
state street corporation | 103
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business units identify, manage and are responsible for the market risks inherent in their businesses. a dedicated market risk management group within erm, and other groups within erm, work with those business units to assist them in the identification, assessment, monitoring, management and control of market risk, and assist business unit managers with their market risk management and measurement activities. erm provides an additional line of oversight, support and coordination designed to promote the consistent identification, measurement and management of market risk across business units, separate from those business units' discrete activities.
the erm market risk management group is responsible for the management of corporate-wide market risk, the monitoring of key market risks and the development and maintenance of market risk management policies, guidelines and standards aligned with our corporate risk appetite. this group also establishes and approves market risk tolerance limits and trading authorities based on, but not limited to, measures of notional amounts, sensitivity, var and stress. such limits and authorities are specified in our trading and market risk guidelines which govern our management of trading market risk.
risk appetite our corporate market risk appetite is specified in policy statements that outline the governance, responsibilities and requirements surrounding the identification, measurement, analysis, management and communication of market risk arising from our trading activities. these policy statements also set forth the market risk control framework designed to monitor, support, manage and control this portion of our risk appetite. all groups involved in the management and control of market risk associated with trading activities are required to comply with the qualitative and quantitative elements of these policy statements. our trading market risk control framework is composed of the following:
•a trading market risk management process led by erm, separate from the business units' discrete activities;
•defined responsibilities and authorities for the primary groups involved in trading market risk management;
•a trading market risk measurement methodology that captures correlation effects and allows aggregation of market risk across risk types, markets and business lines;
•daily monitoring, analysis and reporting of market risk exposures associated with trading activities against market risk limits;
•a defined limit structure and escalation process in the event of a market risk limit excess;
•use of var models to measure the one-day market risk exposure of trading positions;
•use of var as a ten-day-based regulatory capital measure of the market risk exposure of trading positions;
•use of non-var-based limits and other controls;
•use of stressed-var models, stress-testing analysis and scenario analysis to support the trading market risk measurement and management process by assessing how portfolios and global business lines perform under extreme market conditions;
•use of back-testing as a diagnostic tool to assess the accuracy of var models and other risk management techniques; and
•a new product approval process that requires market risk teams to assess trading-related market risks and apply risk tolerance limits to proposed new products and business activities.
we use our cap to assess our overall capital and liquidity in relation to our risk profile and provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity levels. with respect to market risk associated with trading activities, our risk management and our calculations of regulatory capital are based primarily on our internal var models and stress testing analysis. as discussed in detail under "value-at-risk and stressed var" below, var is measured daily by erm.
the cmrc oversees our market risk exposure in relation to limits established within our risk appetite framework. these limits define threshold levels for var- and stressed var-based measures and are applicable to all trading positions subject to regulatory capital requirements. these limits are designed to mitigate undue concentration of market risk exposure, in light of the primarily non-proprietary nature of our trading activities. the risk appetite framework and associated limits are reviewed and approved by the board's rc.
covered positions our trading positions are subject to regulatory market risk capital requirements if they meet the regulatory definition of a "covered position." a covered position is generally defined by u.s. banking regulators as an on- or off-balance sheet position associated with the organization's trading activities that is free of any restrictions on its tradability, but does not include intangible assets, certain credit derivatives recognized as guarantees and certain state street corporation | 104
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations equity positions not publicly traded. all fx and commodity positions are considered covered positions, regardless of the accounting treatment they receive. the identification of covered positions for inclusion in our market risk capital framework is governed by our trading and market risk guidelines, which outline the standards we use to determine whether a trading position is a covered position.
our covered positions consist primarily of the trading portfolios held by our global markets business. they also arise from certain positions held by our global treasury group. these trading positions include products such as foreign exchange spot, foreign exchange forwards, non-deliverable forwards, foreign exchange options, foreign exchange funding swaps, currency futures, financial futures and interest rate futures. new activities are analyzed to determine if the positions arising from such new activities meet the definition of a covered position and conform to our trading and market risk guidelines. this documented analysis, including any decisions with respect to market risk treatments, must receive approval from the cmrc.
we use spot rates, forward points, yield curves and discount factors imported from third-party sources to measure the value of our covered positions, and we use such values to mark our covered positions to market on a daily basis. these values are subject to separate validation by us in order to evaluate reasonableness and consistency with market experience. the mark-to-market gain or loss on spot transactions is calculated by applying the spot rate to the foreign currency principal and comparing the resultant base currency amount to the original transaction principal. the mark-to-market gain or loss on a forward foreign exchange contract or forward cash flow contract is determined as the difference between the life-to-date (historical) value of the cash flow and the value of the cash flow at the inception of the transaction. the mark-to-market gain or loss on interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows from each leg of the swap transaction.
value-at-risk and stressed var we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including var, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. we use a risk measurement methodology to measure trading-related var daily. we have adopted standards for measuring trading-related var, and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements.
we utilize an internal var model to calculate our regulatory market risk capital requirements. we use a historical simulation model to calculate daily var- and stressed var-based measures for our covered positions in conformity with regulatory requirements. our var model seeks to capture identified material risk factors associated with our covered positions, including risks arising from market movements such as changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and option-implied volatilities.
we have adopted standards and guidelines to value our covered positions which govern our var- and stressed var-based measures. our regulatory var-based measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period. we also use the same platform to calculate a one-tail, 99% confidence interval, one-business-day var for internal risk management purposes. a 99% one-tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses are not expected to exceed the estimated var more than 1% of the time, or less than three business days out of a year.
our market risk models, including our var model, are subject to change in connection with the governance, validation and back-testing processes described below. these models can change as a result of changes in our business activities, our historical experiences, market forces and events, regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors. in addition, the models are subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. changes in our models may result in changes in our measurements of our market risk exposures, including var, and related measures, including regulatory capital. these changes could result in material changes in those risk measurements and related measures as calculated and compared from period to period.
value-at-risk measures var measures are based on the most recent two years of historical price movements for instruments and related risk factors to which we have exposure. the instruments in question are limited to foreign exchange spot, forward and options contracts and interest rate contracts, including futures and interest rate swaps. historically, these instruments have exhibited a higher degree of liquidity relative to other available capital markets instruments. as a result, the var measures shown reflect our ability to rapidly adjust exposures in highly dynamic markets. for this reason, risk inventory, in the form of net open positions, across all currencies is typically limited. in addition, long and short positions in major, as well as minor, currencies provide risk offsets that limit our potential downside exposure.
state street corporation | 105
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our var methodology uses a historical simulation approach based on market-observed changes in foreign exchange rates, u.s. and non-u.s. interest rates and implied volatilities, and incorporates the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions. our var model incorporates approximately 5,000 risk factors and includes correlations among currency, interest rates and other market rates.
all var measures are subject to limitations and must be interpreted accordingly. some, but not all, of the limitations of our var methodology include the following:
•compared to a shorter observation period, a two-year observation period is slower to reflect increases in market volatility (although temporary increases in market volatility will affect the calculation of var for a longer period); consequently, in periods of sudden increases in volatility or increasing volatility, in each case relative to the prior two-year period, the calculation of var may understate current risk;
•compared to a longer observation period, a two-year observation period may not reflect as many past periods of volatility in the markets, because such past volatility is no longer in the observation period; consequently, historical market scenarios of high volatility, even if similar to current or likely future market circumstances, may fall outside the two-year observation period, resulting in a potential understatement of current risk;
•the var-based measure is calibrated to a specified level of confidence and does not indicate the potential magnitude of losses beyond this confidence level;
•in certain cases, var-based measures approximate the impact of changes in risk factors on the values of positions and portfolios; this may happen because the number of inputs included in the var model is necessarily limited; for example, yield curve risk factors do not exist for all future dates;
•the use of historical market information may not be predictive of future events, particularly those that are extreme in nature; this "backward-looking" limitation can cause var to understate or overstate risk;
•the effect of extreme and rare market movements is difficult to estimate; this may result from non-linear risk sensitivities as well as the potential for actual volatility and correlation levels to differ from assumptions implicit in the var calculations; and
•intra-day risk is not captured.
we calculate a stressed var-based measure using the same model we use to calculate var, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress. the stressed var model is designed to identify the second-worst outcome occurring in the worst continuous one-year rolling period since july 2007. this stressed var meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial stress. for each portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day var from within the available historical data. this historical data set includes the financial crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the standard & poor's downgrade of u.s. treasury debt in august 2011. as the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time, future market stress events will be incorporated.
stress testing we have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions. we also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs. we conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and we also perform stress testing as part of the federal reserve's ccar process. stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading desk, division and risk-factor level (for example, exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk).
stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by erm and reported to the cmrc. limit breaches are addressed by erm risk managers in conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the cmrc if material. in addition, we have established several action triggers that prompt immediate review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan.
we perform scenario analysis daily based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market state street corporation | 106
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations conditions recur. relevant scenarios are chosen from an inventory of historical financial stresses and applied to our current portfolio. these historical event scenarios involve spot foreign exchange, credit, equity, unforeseen geo-political events and natural disasters, and government and central bank intervention scenarios. examples of the specific historical scenarios we incorporate in our stress testing program may include the asian financial crisis of 1997, the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. and the 2008 financial crisis. we continue to update our inventory of historical stress scenarios as new stress conditions emerge in the financial markets.
as each of the historical stress events is associated with a different time horizon, we normalize results by scaling down the longer horizon events to a ten-day horizon and keeping the shorter horizon events (i.e., events that are shorter than ten days) at their original terms. we also conduct sensitivity analysis daily to calculate the impact of a large predefined shock in a specific risk factor or a group of risk factors on our current portfolio. these predefined shocks include parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts and foreign exchange spot and volatility surface shifts. in a parallel shift scenario, we apply a constant factor shift across all yield curve tenors. in a non-parallel shift scenario, we apply different shock levels to different tenors of a yield curve, rather than shifting the entire curve by a constant amount. non-parallel shifts include steepening, flattening and butterflies.
validation and back-testing we perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our var-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. this back-testing involves the comparison of estimated var model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss (p&l) outcomes observed from daily market movements. we back-test our var model using a "clean" p&l, which excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and nii, as well as estimated revenue from intraday trading.
our var definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees, commissions, changes to reserves and gains or losses from intraday activity.
we experienced no back-testing exceptions in 2023 and three back-testing exceptions in 2022. at a
99% confidence interval, the statistical expectation for a var model is to witness one exception every hundred trading days (or two to three exceptions per year). two 2022 back-testing exceptions occurred on days of higher volatility on the back of market concerns on economic outlook, inflation and central bank rate policy. a third back-testing exception occurred during the uk market turmoil in late september 2022.
our model validation process also evaluates the integrity of our var models through the use of regular outcome analysis. this outcome analysis includes back-testing, which compares the var model's predictions to actual outcomes using out-of-sample information. consistent with regulatory guidance, the back-testing compared a "clean" p&l, defined above, with the one-day var produced by the model. the back-testing was performed for a time period not used for model development. the number of occurrences where "clean" trading-book p&l exceeded the one-day var was within our expected var tolerance level.
market risk reporting our erm market risk management group is responsible for market risk monitoring and reporting. we use a variety of systems and controlled market feeds from third-party services to compile data for several daily, weekly and monthly management reports.
the following tables present var and stressed var associated with our trading activities for covered positions held during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as measured by our var methodology. diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for each trading activity. this effect arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.

the average and period-end stressed var-based measures were approximately $41 million and $60 million, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to $34 million and $27 million, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase in the average stressed var is primarily attributed to higher foreign exchange and interest rate risk positions.
the var-based measures as presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our trading activities. while overall levels of volatility have varied over the historical observation periods, smaller residual market risk positions during the quarter have led to a reduction in var measures presented.
we have in the past and may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate var and stressed var, subject to regulatory review and approval, and any future modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our var-based and stressed var-based measures.
the following tables present the var and stressed-var associated with our trading activities attributable to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the totals of the var-based and stressed var-based measures for the three attributes in total exceeded the related total var and total stressed var presented in the foregoing tables as of each period-end, primarily due to the benefits of diversification across risk types. diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for each trading activity. this effect arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.

(1) for purposes of risk attribution by component, foreign exchange refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates. forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that is captured by the measures used for interest rate risk. accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest rate risk component.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset and liability management activities the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable nii under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. while many market factors affect the level of nii and the economic value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. most of our nii is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses. we invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the liquidity characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, as well as the currency composition of our significant non-u.s. dollar denominated client deposits.
we quantify nii sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio positioning. this measure compares our baseline view of nii over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of rate shocks. our baseline view of nii is updated on a regular basis. table 36, key interest rates for baseline forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at december 31, 2023 and 2022. our baseline rate forecast as of december 31, 2023 was generally consistent with common market expectations for global central bank actions at that point in time, which implied that rates have reached peak levels and rate cuts will begin in the first half of 2024.

in table 37: net interest income sensitivity, we report the expected change in nii over the next twelve months from instantaneous 100 basis point shocks to various tenors on the yield curve relative to our baseline rate forecast, including the impacts from u.s. and non-u.s. rates. each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our financial performance. while investment securities balances and composition can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change, for purposes of this analysis our deposit balances and mix are assumed to remain consistent with the baseline forecast which assumes client deposit balance rotation including reductions in non-interest-bearing deposit balances. the results of these scenarios should not be extrapolated for other (e.g., more severe) shocks as the impact of interest rate shocks may not be linear. in lower rate scenarios, the full impact of the shock is realized for all currencies even if the result is negative interest rates.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our overall balance sheet, including all currencies, continues to be asset sensitive with an nii benefit in higher rate scenarios and nii exposure in lower rate scenarios. as of december 31, 2023, our usd balance sheet's nii sensitivity is relatively neutral given expectations for usd deposit betas and the repricing characteristics of our usd assets. compared to december 31, 2022, our usd nii positioning is less liability sensitive as a result of lower investment portfolio balances and hedging activity, partially offset by impact from rising deposit betas and deposit rotation. as of december 31, 2023, non-usd nii benefits from higher rate scenarios and is exposed to lower rates primarily driven by our sensitivities on the short-end of the yield curve. usd and non-usd nii sensitivities are also impacted by routine currency-level baseline forecasting updates and refinements, including deposit betas.
eve sensitivity is a discounted cash flow model designed to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities under a series of interest rate shocks over a long-term horizon. in the following table, we report our eve sensitivity to 200 bps instantaneous rate shocks, relative to spot interest rates. management compares the change in eve sensitivity against our aggregate tier 1 and tier 2 risk-based capital. eve sensitivity is dependent on the timing of interest and principal cash flows. also, the measure only evaluates the spot balance sheet and does not include the impact of new business assumptions.

as of december 31, 2023, eve sensitivity remains exposed to upward shifts in interest rates. compared to december 31, 2022, our sensitivity in the up 200bp shock scenario increased due to lower liability duration driven by client deposit rotation and higher betas.
both nii sensitivity and eve sensitivity are routinely monitored as market conditions change. for additional information about our asset and liability management activities, refer to management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, "risk management."
model risk management the use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry, with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financial decision making. the models contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial management and a source of risk. in large banking organizations like us, model results influence business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect on our financial performance. as a result, the mrm framework seeks to mitigate our model risk.
our mrm program has three principal components:
•a model risk governance program that defines roles and responsibilities, including the authority to restrict model usage, provides policies and guidance, monitors compliance and reports regularly to the board on the overall degree of model risk across the corporation;
•a model development process that focuses on sound design and computational accuracy, and includes activities designed to assess data quality, to test for robustness, stability and sensitivity to assumptions, and to conduct ongoing monitoring of model performance; and
•a model validation function designed to verify that models are conceptually sound, computationally accurate, are performing as expected, and are in line with their intended use.
the mrm framework, highlighted above, also provides insight and guidance into addressing key model risks that arise.
governance models used in the regulatory capital calculation can only be deployed for use after undergoing a model validation by erm's mrm group. the model validation results and/or a decision by the model risk committee must permit model usage or the model may not be used.
erm's mrm group is responsible for defining the corporate-wide model risk management framework and maintaining policies that are designed to achieve the framework's objectives. all regulatory capital calculation models, including any artificial intelligence and machine learning models, must comply with the model risk management framework and corresponding policies. the group is responsible for overall model risk governance capabilities, with particular emphasis in the areas of model identification, model validation, model risk reporting, model performance monitoring, tracking of new model state street corporation | 110
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations development status and committee-level review and challenge.
mrc, which is composed of senior managers representing mrm along with functional areas and business units with key models across the organization, reports to mrac, and provides guidance and oversight to the mrm function.
model development and ongoing monitoring models are developed under guidelines governing data sourcing, methodology selection and model integrity testing. model development includes a statement of purpose to align development with intended use. it may also include a comparison of alternative approaches to promote a sound modeling approach.
model developers conduct an assessment of data quality and relevance. the development teams conduct a variety of tests of the accuracy, robustness and stability of each model.
model owners submit models to the mvg for validation on a regular basis, as per the existing policy. the model owners also conduct ongoing monitoring of each model.
model validation mvg is part of mrm within erm and performs model validations and reviews. mvg is independent, as contemplated by applicable bank regulatory requirements, of both the developers and users of the models. mvg validates models through an evaluation process that assesses the appropriateness, accuracy, and suitability of data inputs, methodologies, documentation, assumptions, and processing code. model validation also encompasses an assessment of model performance, sensitivity, and robustness, as well as a model's potential limitations given its particular assumptions or deficiencies. based on the results of its review, mvg issues a model use decision and may require remedial actions and/or compensating controls on model use. mvg also maintains a model risk rating system, which assigns a risk rating to each model based on an assessment of a model's inherent and residual risks. these ratings aid in the understanding and reporting of model risk across the model portfolio, and enable the triaging of needs for remediation.
although model validation is the primary method of subjecting models to independent review and challenge, in practice, a multi-step governance process provides the opportunity for challenge by multiple parties. first, mvg conducts a model validation and issues a model use decision. mvg communicates their result as one of the following three outcomes: "approved", "approved with conditions", or "not approved". there are three ways in which a model can be deemed "not approved for use" given a validation: 1) the aggregation of the model scoring within mrm's model risk rating system is poor enough to result in a "high" rating, 2) the scoring of one or more model risk rating system element(s) is deemed "critical" resulting in an automatic "high" rating irrespective of the other elements as the "critical" element(s) undermines the model, or 3) the remediation action is not properly taken by the due date resulting in a severe compliance breach that undercuts the model rating. second, these decisions may be reviewed, challenged, and confirmed by the mrc. finally, model use decisions, risk ratings, and overall levels of model risk may be escalated to and reviewed by mrac. mrm also reports regularly on model risk issues to the board.
strategic risk management we define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment; decline in market performance or changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit, operational, model or liquidity risks. we incorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes. management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business.
separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and strategic risk is sometimes difficult. for instance, the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a strategic risk loss. an additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a major acquisition. failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue, would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk.
strategic risk is managed with a long-term focus. techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans, which are subject to review and challenge from senior management and the board of directors, as well as a formal review and approval process for all new business and product proposals. the potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. we use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario state street corporation | 111
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analysis, stress-testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on us attributable to strategic risk. management and control of strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units, with oversight from the control functions, as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes.
capital managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. we assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.
framework our objective with respect to management of our capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting clients' cash management needs, and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors. we strive to maintain an appropriate level of capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and long-term, while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and complying with regulatory capital requirements.
our capital management focuses on our risk exposures, the regulatory requirements applicable to us with respect to multiple capital measures, the evaluations and resulting credit ratings of the major independent rating agencies, our return on capital at both the consolidated and line-of-business level and our capital position relative to our peers.
assessment of our overall capital adequacy includes the comparison of capital sources with capital uses, as well as the consideration of the quality and quantity of the various components of capital. the assessment seeks to determine the optimal level of capital and composition of capital instruments to satisfy all constituents of capital, with the lowest overall cost to shareholders. other factors considered in our assessment of capital adequacy are strategic and contingency planning, stress testing and planned capital actions.
capital adequacy process (cap)
our primary federal banking regulator is the federal reserve. both we and state street bank are subject to the minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the federal reserve and defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act. state street bank must exceed the regulatory capital thresholds for "well capitalized" in order for our parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company. accordingly, one of our primary objectives with respect to capital management is to exceed all applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements and for state street bank to be "well capitalized" under the pca guidelines established by the fdic. our capital management activities are conducted as part of our corporate-wide cap and associated capital policy and guidelines.
we consider capital adequacy to be a key element of our financial well-being, which affects our ability to attract and maintain client relationships; operate effectively in the global capital markets; and satisfy regulatory, security holders and shareholder needs. capital is one of several elements that affect our credit ratings and the ratings of our principal subsidiaries.
in conformity with our capital policy and guidelines, we strive to achieve and maintain specific internal capital levels, not just at a point in time, but over time and during periods of stress, to account for changes in our strategic direction, evolving economic conditions, and financial and market volatility. we have developed and implemented a corporate-wide cap to assess our overall capital in relation to our risk profile and to provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital levels. the cap considers material risks under multiple scenarios, with an emphasis on stress scenarios, and encompasses existing processes and systems used to measure our capital adequacy.
capital contingency planning contingency planning is an integral component of capital management. the objective of contingency planning is to monitor current and forecast levels of select capital, liquidity and other measures that serve as early indicators of a potentially adverse capital or liquidity adequacy situation. these measures are one of the inputs used to set our internal capital adequacy level. we review these measures annually for appropriateness and relevance in relation to our financial budget and capital plan. in addition, we maintain an inventory of capital contingency actions designed to conserve or generate capital to support the unique risks in our business model, our client and investor demands and regulatory requirements.
stress testing we administer a robust business-wide stress-testing program that executes stress tests each year to assess the institution's capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions. our stress testing program is structured around what we determine to be the key risks inherent in our business, as assessed through a recurring material state street corporation | 112
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk identification process. the material risk identification process represents a bottom-up approach to identifying the institution's most significant risk exposures across all on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities, including credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational, fiduciary, business, reputation and regulatory risks. these key risks serve as an organizing principle for much of our risk management framework, as well as reporting, including the "risk dashboard" provided to the board.
in connection with the focus on our key risks, each stress test incorporates idiosyncratic loss events tailored to our unique risk profile and business activities. due to the nature of our business model and our consolidated statement of condition, our risks differ from those of a traditional commercial bank. over the past few years, stress scenarios have included a deep recession in the u.s., including impacts from the covid-19 pandemic, a break-up of the eurozone, a severe recession in china and an oil shock precipitated by turmoil in the middle east/north africa region.
the federal reserve requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, which includes us, to submit a capital plan on an annual basis. the federal reserve uses its annual ccar process, which incorporates hypothetical financial and economic stress scenarios, to review those capital plans and assess whether banking organizations have capital planning processes that account for idiosyncratic risks and provide for sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. as part of its ccar process, the federal reserve assesses each organization's capital adequacy, capital planning process and plans to distribute capital, such as dividend payments or stock purchase programs. management and board risk committees review, challenge and approve ccar results and assumptions before submission to the federal reserve.
through the evaluation of our capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions, the stress testing process provides us important insights for capital planning, risk management and strategic decision-making.
governance in order to support integrated decision making, we have identified three management elements to aid in the compatibility and coordination of our cap:
•risk management - identification, measurement, monitoring and forecasting of different types of risk and their combined impact on capital adequacy;
•capital management - determination of optimal capital levels; and
•business management - strategic planning, budgeting, forecasting and performance management.
we have a hierarchical structure supporting appropriate committee review of relevant risk and capital information. the ongoing responsibility for capital management rests with our treasurer. the capital management group within global treasury is responsible for the capital policy and guidelines, development of the capital plan, the oversight of global capital management and optimization.
the mrac provides oversight of our capital management, our capital adequacy, our internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies. in addition, mrac approves our balance sheet strategy and related activities. the board's rc assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities related to the assessment and management of risk and capital. our capital policy is reviewed and approved annually by the board's rc.
global systemically important bank we have been identified by the financial stability board and the basel committee on banking supervision as a g-sib. our designation as a g-sib is based on a number of factors, as evaluated by banking regulators, and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the basel iii rule.
we and our depositary institution subsidiaries are subject to the current basel iii minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio guidelines.
additional information about g-sibs is provided under "regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity standards" in "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k.
regulatory capital we and state street bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to the u.s. basel iii framework. we are also subject to the final market risk capital rule issued by u.s. banking regulators.
the basel iii rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy: the "standardized approach" and the "advanced approaches", applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations, like us. the standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk rwa, including specified risk weights for on and certain off-balance sheet exposures. the advanced approaches consist of the advanced internal ratings-based approach used for the calculation of credit risk rwa, and the advanced measurement approach used for the calculation of operational risk rwa.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as required by the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (dodd-frank act) enacted in 2010, we and state street bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to a "capital floor," also referred to as the collins amendment, in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy, such that our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the advanced approaches and the standardized approach. under the advanced approaches, state street and state street bank are subject to a 2.5% ccb requirement, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer requirement, which is currently set at 0%. under the standardized approach, state street bank is subject to the same ccb and countercyclical capital buffer requirements, but for state street, the 2.5% ccb requirement is replaced by the scb requirement according to the scb rule issued in 2020. in addition, state street is subject to a g-sib surcharge.
the scb replaced, under the standardized approach, the ccb with a buffer calculated as the difference between the institution's starting and lowest projected cet1 ratio under the ccar severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock dividend payments (as a percentage of rwa) from the fourth through seventh quarter of the ccar planning horizon. the scb requirement can be no less than 2.5% of rwa. breaching the scb or other regulatory buffer or surcharge will limit a banking organization's ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.
our scb requirement was 2.5% for the period from october 1, 2022 through september 30, 2023. on june 28, 2023, we were notified by the federal reserve of the results from the 2023 supervisory stress test. our scb calculated under the 2023 supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an scb at that floor, which went into effect starting october 1, 2023 and will remain effective through september 30, 2024.
our minimum risk-based capital ratios as of january 1, 2023 include a ccb of 2.5% and a scb of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and standardized approach, respectively, a g-sib surcharge of 1.0%, and a countercyclical buffer of 0.0%. this results in minimum risk-based ratios of 8.0% for the common equity tier 1 (cet1) capital ratio, 9.5% for the tier 1 capital ratio, and 11.5% for the total capital ratio.
our current g-sib surcharge, through december 31, 2024, is 1.0%. based upon preliminary calculations using data as of december 31, 2023, we currently anticipate that our surcharge will remain at 1% through december 31, 2025; however, that calculation has not yet been finalized and is subject to many financial, balance sheet, market and other factors, and consequently there is a risk that a higher g-sib surcharge of 1.5% will result from the final calculation.
to maintain the status of the parent company as a financial holding company, we and our idi subsidiaries are required, among other requirements, to be "well capitalized" as defined by regulation y and regulation h.
the market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily measures of var, which reflect general market risk for certain of our trading positions defined by the rule as "covered positions," as well as stressed-var measures to supplement the var measures. the rule also requires a public disclosure composed of qualitative and quantitative information about the market risk associated with our trading activities and our related var and stressed-var measures. the qualitative and quantitative information required by the rule is provided under "market risk management" included in this management's discussion and analysis.
the following table presents the regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios for us and state street bank as of the dates indicated. we are subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and those calculated under the advanced approaches in the assessment of our capital adequacy under applicable bank regulatory standards.

(1) other adjustments within cet1 capital primarily include aoci hedges that are not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet, the overfunded portion of our defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities, disallowed deferred tax assets, and other required credit risk-based deductions.
(2) under the advanced approaches, credit risk rwa includes a cva which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of otc derivative contracts. we used a simple cva approach in conformity with the basel iii advanced approaches.
(3) under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, rwa attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. an individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational rwa under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven basel-defined uoms.
(4) minimum requirements include a ccb of 2.5% and a scb of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and the standardized approach, respectively, a g-sib surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical capital buffer of 0%. on june 28, 2023, we were notified by the federal reserve of the results from the 2023 supervisory stress test. our preliminary scb calculated under the 2023 supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an scb at that floor, which will be in effect from october 1, 2023 through september 30, 2024.
na not applicable our cet1 capital decreased $1.58 billion as of december 31, 2023 compared to december 31, 2022, primarily due to common share repurchases and dividends declared in 2023, partially offset by net income and an improvement in aoci. our tier 1 capital decreased $1.58 billion as of december 31, 2023 compared to december 31, 2022 under both the advanced approaches and standardized approach, due to the decrease in cet1 capital.
our tier 2 capital increased under the advanced approaches and standardized approach, as of december 31, 2023 compared to december 31, 2022, by $0.49 billion and $0.52 billion, respectively, mainly driven by the net issuances of our tier 2 qualifying debt.
total capital decreased under the advanced approaches and standardized approach, as of december 31, 2023 compared to december 31, 2022, by $1.08 billion and $1.05 billion, respectively, mainly driven by the decrease in cet1 capital, partially offset by an increase in tier 2 capital.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december 31, 2023, total advanced approaches rwa increased $2.09 billion compared to december 31, 2022, mainly due to an increase in operational risk rwa. the increase in operational risk rwa primarily reflects higher frequency of conduct and business practices events in the five-year frequency window. credit risk rwa was flat year-over-year. rwa increases in reverse repurchase transactions driven by increased volume and higher equity market levels, in loans driven by new capital call commitments and in securitization driven by new collateralized loan obligation loans, were mostly offset by rwa decreases in derivative exposures driven by volatility.
as of december 31, 2023, total standardized approach rwa increased $4.48 billion compared to december 31, 2022, mainly driven by an increase in credit risk rwa. the increase in credit risk rwa primarily reflects higher reverse repurchase transactions rwa driven by increased volume and higher equity market levels and higher loans rwa related to new capital call commitments, partially offset by lower investment securities rwa due to the impact of the investment portfolio repositioning.
the regulatory capital ratios as of december 31, 2023, presented in table 39: regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios, are calculated under the advanced approaches and standardized approach in conformity with the basel iii final rule. the advanced approaches based ratios reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our capital and related matters as of december 31, 2023, based on our and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions, collectively referred to as "advanced systems," in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on form 10-q or an annual report on form 10-k. significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.
our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. for example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total rwa and our capital ratios compared to prior periods. an operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven basel-defined uom, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom, and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations.
due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the basel iii final rule will change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. the full effects of the basel iii final rule on us and state street bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios we are subject to a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio and slr. the tier 1 leverage ratio is based on tier 1 capital and adjusted quarterly average on-balance sheet assets. the tier 1 leverage ratio differs from the slr primarily in that the denominator of the tier 1 leverage ratio is a quarterly average of on-balance sheet assets, while the slr additionally includes off-balance sheet exposures. we must maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.
we are also subject to a minimum slr of 3%, and as a u.s. g-sib, we must maintain a 2% slr buffer in order to avoid any limitations on distributions to shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives. if we do not maintain this buffer, limitations on these distributions and discretionary bonus payments would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall.

amount equal to:
external tlac                 greater of:•21.5% of total rwa (18.0% minimum plus 2.5% plus a g-sib surcharge calculated for these purposes under method 1 of 1.0% plus any applicable countercyclical buffer, which is currently 0%); and •9.5% of total leverage exposure (7.5% minimum plus the slr buffer of 2.0%), as defined by the slr final rule.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory developments on july 27, 2023, the u.s. agencies issued a proposed rule to implement the basel iii endgame proposal for large banks, and separately proposed the g-sib surcharge proposal. the basel iii endgame proposal would, among other things, eliminate the advanced approaches for monitoring capital adequacy in favor of a new standardized expanded risk-based approach that would include, unlike the current standardized approach, operational risk and cva risk rwa components, and would also replace the existing market risk rule with the new fundamental review of the frtb framework. the g-sib surcharge proposal would, among other things, measure the g-sib surcharge in more granular 0.1% increments as opposed to the 0.5% increments that currently apply.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in january 2024, we issued 1.5 million depositary shares, each representing 1/100th ownership interest in shares of fixed-to-floating rate, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series i, without par value per share, with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (equivalent to $1,000 per depositary share), in a public offering. the aggregate proceeds, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other issuance costs, were approximately $1.5 billion. dividends on the series i preferred stock will be payable quarterly at an initial rate of 6.700% per annum commencing on june 15, 2024, with the first dividend payable on a pro-rata basis. our preferred stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof, are subject to consideration and approval by the board at the relevant times.
in addition, on february 8, 2024, we announced that we will redeem on march 15, 2024 an aggregate $1.0 billion, or all 7,500 outstanding shares, of our non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series d (represented by 30,000,000 depository shares), for a cash redemption price of $100,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depository share), plus all declared and unpaid dividends and all 2,500 of the outstanding shares of our non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series f (represented by 250,000 depository shares), for a cash redemption price of $100,000 per share (equivalent to $1,000 per depositary share) plus all declared and unpaid dividends. cash dividends on the series d and f preferred stock, of approximately $1,475 and $2,336, respectively, per share, or approximately $0.37 and $23.36, respectively per depository share have been declared for the period from december 15, 2023 up to but not including march 15, 2024 (together, the "march dividends"). the march dividends will be paid separately to the holders of record of the series d preferred stock and the series f preferred stock as of february 29, 2024 in the customary manner. accordingly, there will not be any declared and unpaid dividends included in the series d and series f redemption price.

federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. in addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. for information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to "related stockholder matters" included under item 5, market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities, and to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k. our common stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof, are subject to consideration and approval by the board at the relevant times.
stock purchases under our common share repurchase program may be made using various types of transactions, including open market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or other transactions off the market, and may be made under rule 10b5-1 trading programs. the timing and amount of any stock purchases and the type of transaction may not be ratable over the duration of the program, may vary from reporting period to reporting period and will depend on several factors, including our capital position and our financial performance, investment opportunities, market conditions, the nature and timing of implementation of revisions to the basel iii framework and the amount of common stock issued as part of employee compensation programs. the common share repurchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.
off-balance sheet arrangements on behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. in most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. the aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $279.92 billion and $348.92 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. we hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. we revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower. we held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $293.86 billion and $366.90 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
the cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. in certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. we require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. in our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. of the collateral of $293.86 billion and $366.90 billion, referenced above, $59.03 billion and $54.11 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we or our agents held $63.11 billion and $57.90 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.
certain of our accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements.
based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions, the more significant accounting policies identified by management are:
•recurring fair value measurements;
•allowance for credit losses;
•impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and
•contingencies.
these policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. an understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential to the understanding of our reported results of operations and financial condition.
the following is a discussion of the above-mentioned significant accounting estimates. additional information on our significant accounting policies, including references to applicable footnotes, is provided in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
fair value measurements we carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, including trading account assets and liabilities, afs debt securities, certain equity securities and various types of derivative financial instruments.
changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in our consolidated statement of condition. in addition to those financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, we estimate the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities that we carry at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition, and we disclose these fair value estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. we estimate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below.
u.s. gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. when we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or the most advantageous market in which we would transact; we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. when possible, we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical, or similar, financial assets and liabilities. when identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, we look to market-observable data for similar assets and liabilities. in some instances, certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets; as a result, we use alternate valuation techniques to measure their fair value.
we categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based on u.s. gaap's prescribed three-level valuation hierarchy. the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3).
with respect to derivative instruments, we evaluate the fair value impact of the credit risk of our counterparties. we consider such factors as the market-based probability of default by our counterparties, and our current and expected potential future net exposures by remaining maturities, in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations allowance for credit losses we record an allowance for credit losses related to certain on-balance sheet credit exposures, including our financial assets held at amortized cost, as well as certain off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded commitments and letters of credit.
determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. in future periods, factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods. we estimate credit losses over the contractual life of the financial asset while factoring in prepayment activity where supported by data over a three year reasonable and supportable forecast period. we utilize baseline, upside and downside scenarios that are applied based on a probability weighting, in order to better reflect management's expectation of expected credit losses given existing market conditions and the changes in the economic environment. the multiple scenarios are based on a three year horizon (or less depending on contractual maturity) and then revert linearly over a two year period to a ten-year historical average thereafter. the contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications, but includes prepayment assumptions where applicable.
our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of inputs, including macroeconomic forecast assumptions and credit rating migrations during the period. our macroeconomic forecasts used in determining the december 31, 2023 allowance for credit losses consisted of three scenarios reflecting contractions in gdp and rising unemployment of varying severity, with the baseline scenario generally in line with market consensus of economic forecasts for gdp and unemployment. we placed the most weight on our baseline scenario, with the remaining weighting split equally between the upside and downside scenarios.
keeping all other factors constant, we estimate that if we had applied 100% weighting to the downside scenario, the allowance for credit losses as of december 31, 2023 would have been approximately $58 million higher. this estimate is intended to reflect the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in our scenario weights and is not intended to be indicative of future changes in the allowance for credit losses.
additional information about our allowance for credit losses is provided in notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired at the acquisition date. other intangible assets represent purchased long-lived intangible assets, primarily client relationships, core deposit intangible assets and technology that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. other intangible assets are initially measured at their acquisition date fair value, the determination of which requires management judgment. goodwill is not amortized, while other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
management reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances arise or events occur that indicate an impairment of the carrying amount may exist. we begin our review by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. events that may indicate impairment include: significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more-likely-than-not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate. if we conclude from the qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is greater than its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. however, if we determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment. we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and complete a quantitative assessment in any given year.
in 2023, due to the passage of time since the last quantitative test, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and we assessed goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach. we determined there was no goodwill impairment in 2023.
other intangible assets are supported by the future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the intangible asset, less any costs associated with the intangible asset's eventual disposition. we evaluate other intangible assets for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other groups of assets using the following process. first, we routinely assess whether impairment indicators are present. when impairment indicators are identified as being present, we compare the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows of the state street corporation | 123

other matters closures of silicon valley bank and signature bank and related fdic matters on march 12 and 13, 2023, following the closures of silicon valley bank (svb) and signature bank and the appointment of the fdic as the receiver for those banks, the fdic announced that, under the systemic risk exception set forth in the federal deposit insurance act (fdia), all insured and uninsured deposits of those banks were transferred to the respective bridge banks for svb and signature bank. the fdic also announced that, as required by the fdia, any losses to the deposit insurance fund ("dif") to support uninsured depositors would be recovered by a special assessment.
on november 29, 2023, the fdic published in the federal register a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the dif arising from the protection of uninsured depositors following the closure of svb and signature bank. the fdic has determined that the current total special assessment for those purposes is $16.3 billion, which is approximately equal to the fdic's estimate of losses to the dif attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors at svb and signature bank. the fdic will determine the exact amount of losses incurred when it terminates the receiverships of these two banks, and the amount of the special assessment will be adjusted as the loss estimates change. for idis such as state street bank, the special assessment will be applied at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points multiplied by the idi's estimated uninsured deposits, reported as of december 31, 2022 and adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits from the idi. the fdic will collect the special assessment over eight quarterly assessment periods, although the collection period may change due to updates to the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination or if assessments collected change due to corrective amendments to the amount of uninsured deposits reported for the december 31, 2022 reporting period. the final rule is effective on april 1, 2024, with the first collection for the special assessment reflected on the invoice for the first quarterly assessment period of 2024 (i.e., january 1 through march 31, 2024), with a payment date of june 28, 2024.
in the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized a pre-tax expense within other expenses of approximately $387 million, reflecting the current full amount of state street bank's allocation of the special assessment consistent with the calculation methodology noted above. the total expense for the special assessment remains subject to any actions by the fdic, as described above, to cease collection early, extend the collection period, or impose a final additional shortfall special assessment.

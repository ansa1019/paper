item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with td group's consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. the following discussion may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under the heading entitled "risk factors" included elsewhere in this report. these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below.
overview for fiscal year 2023, we generated net sales of $6,585 million, gross profit of $3,842 million or 58.3% of net sales, and net income attributable to td group of $1,298 million. we believe we have achieved steady, long-term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our value-driven operating strategy. more specifically, we believe that focusing our businesses on our value-driven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business, carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered value-added products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long-term.
our selective acquisition strategy has also been an important contribution to the growth of our business. the integration of acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements in the financial performance of the acquired business.
we believe our key competitive strengths include:
large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream. we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products. we estimate that our products are installed on over 100,000 commercial transport, regional transport, military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft.
diversified revenue base. we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance. our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production. we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications. our current initiatives include creating new products that are more environmentally friendly, such as radiation-free exciters, and creating new products that will help further improve commercial airlines' efforts to keep passengers healthy and safe, such as touch-free aircraft lavatory suite products.
our business strategy is made up of two key elements: (1) a value-driven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and (2) a selective acquisition strategy.
value-driven operating strategy. our three core value drivers are:
•obtaining profitable new business. we attempt to obtain profitable new business by using our technical expertise and application skill and our detailed knowledge of our customer base and the individual niche markets in which we operate. we have regularly been successful in identifying and developing both aftermarket and oem products to drive our growth.
•improving our cost structure. we are committed to maintaining and continuously improving our lean cost structure through detailed attention to the cost of each of the products that we offer and our organizational structure, with a focus on reducing the cost of each.
•providing highly engineered value-added products to customers. we focus on the engineering, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of highly engineered niche products that we believe provide value to our customers. we believe we have been consistently successful in communicating to our customers the value of our products. this has generally enabled us to price our products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so.
selective acquisition strategy. we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies. the aerospace industry, in particular, remains highly fragmented, with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small non-core operations of larger businesses. we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture. as of the date of this report, we have successfully acquired approximately 88 businesses and product lines since our formation in 1993. many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility, which enables a higher production capacity utilization, which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume. in the case of larger acquisitions that consist of multiple operating units (such as the esterline acquisition in fiscal 2019), we may pursue opportunities to divest certain acquired operating units that are not in line with our long-term acquisition strategy.
acquisitions and divestitures during the most recent three fiscal years is described in note 2, "acquisitions and divestitures," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein. also as further disclosed in note 2, on november 9, 2023, transdigm announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the electron device business of communications & power industries for approximately $1,385 million in cash. the acquisition is expected to close by the end of transdigm's third quarter of fiscal 2024.
throughout fiscal 2023, we continued to see a rebound in our commercial aerospace end markets from the covid-19 pandemic and are encouraged by the progression of the commercial aerospace market recovery to date. commercial air travel in domestic markets continues to lead the air traffic recovery with most domestic markets nearing, achieving or surpassing pre-pandemic air traffic levels. the pace of the international recovery has been slower than the domestic recovery and remains below pre-pandemic levels. however, international rpks, a metric used to measure air traffic demand, continues to make positive strides as most countries have removed international traveler restrictions and there is pent-up demand for long-haul travel. current industry consensus indicates that worldwide rpks will recover or surpass calendar year 2019 (i.e., pre-pandemic levels) in calendar year 2024. therefore, we expect the company's commercial aerospace end markets to continue progressing into fiscal 2024 barring any significant disruptions or setbacks. in fiscal 2023, we experienced improved sales in the commercial oem sector primarily due to increased aircraft production by boeing and airbus. aircraft production rates continue to lag pre-pandemic levels, mainly due to continued commercial oem supply chain issues that are slowing the pace of new aircraft manufacturing. however, airline demand for new aircraft is strong and both boeing and airbus have disclosed further planned oem production rate increases for calendar 2024.
the pace of u.s. government defense spending outlays and government funding reprioritization provides for uncertainty in the defense aerospace market. defense sales rebounded in the second half of fiscal 2023 due to improving u.s. government defense spend outlays (though, in management's estimation, the current lag between spend authorizations and outlays remains longer than historical average levels). recent dod budgets have trended upwards; however, the ongoing conflicts between russia and ukraine and israel and hamas and potential impact on reprioritization of u.s. government defense spending and other ancillary impacts of these conflicts causes uncertainty.
in fiscal 2023, the pandemic continued to disrupt the global supply chain and labor markets, though the disruption has gradually improved. the disruption has resulted in delays in the availability of certain raw materials and increased freight costs, raw material costs and labor costs. our business has been adversely affected, though not materially, and could continue to be adversely affected by disruptions in our ability to timely obtain raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms. although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers, or alternative raw materials or component parts, the lengthy and expensive aviation authority and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier, raw material or component part.

organic sales represent net sales from existing businesses owned by the company, excluding sales from acquisitions. acquisition sales represent net sales from acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their respective acquisition date. we believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. refer to note 2, "acquisitions and divestitures," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information on the company's recent acquisitions activity.
the increase in organic sales of $985 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 is primarily related to increases in commercial aftermarket sales ($494 million, an increase of 31.4%), commercial oem sales ($266 million, an increase of 23.1%) and defense sales ($242 million, an increase of 10.4%). the increase in commercial aftermarket sales is primarily attributable to the continued recovery in commercial air travel demand and the resulting higher flight hours and utilization of aircraft in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. the increase in commercial oem sales is primarily attributable to the continued recovery in both narrow-body and wide-body aircraft production and deliveries. the increase in defense sales is primarily attributable to improving u.s. government defense spend outlays (though, in management's estimation, the current lag between spend authorizations and outlays remains longer than historical average levels but has improved in the second half of fiscal 2023).
the acquisition sales for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 are attributable to calspan, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and dart aerospace ("dart"), which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.

the change in cost of sales during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 decreased as a percentage of net sales despite increased inflationary pressures. this was primarily driven by the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers) coupled with fixed overhead costs incurred being spread over a higher production volume. a favorable sales mix, specifically, higher commercial aftermarket sales as a percentage of net sales compared to commercial oem and defense net sales also contributed to the gross profit as a percentage of net sales increasing by 1.2 percentage points to 58.3% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 from 57.1% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022.
regarding the specific components to cost of sales listed above, foreign exchange rates, particularly the u.s. dollar compared to the british pound and the euro, weakened particularly in the first half of fiscal 2023 resulting in unfavorable movement. in fiscal 2022, the u.s. dollar strengthened considerably in the fourth quarter resulting in foreign currency gains. no other material movement in the components to cost of sales were identified.
•selling and administrative expenses. selling and administrative expenses increased by $32 million to $780 million, or 11.8% of net sales, for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 from $748 million, or 13.8% of net sales, for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022. selling and administrative expenses and the related percentage of net sales for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (amounts in millions):

selling and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 improved as a percentage of net sales compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 as a result of higher net sales and our continued strategic cost mitigation efforts. the decrease in non-cash stock and deferred compensation expense is primarily attributable to fewer modifications to existing stock option grants compared to prior year. the change in bad debt expense in fiscal 2023 relates to the improving market conditions within commercial aerospace and the resulting reduction in assessed risk associated with the collectability of certain trade accounts receivable.
•amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets was $139 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 compared to $136 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022. the increase in amortization expense of $3 million was primarily due to the amortization expense recognized on intangible assets from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 acquisition of calspan and the third quarter of fiscal 2022 acquisition of dart. the increase was partially offset by the cobham aero connectivity ("cac") acquisition backlog being fully amortized in fiscal 2022.
•interest expense-net. interest expense-net includes interest on borrowings outstanding, amortization of debt issuance costs, original issue discount and premium, revolving credit facility fees, finance leases, interest income and the impact of interest rate swaps and caps designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges. interest expense-net increased $88 million, or 8.2%, to $1,164 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 from $1,076 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022. the increase in interest expense-net was primarily due to an increase in the base rates, i.e., term sofr and london interbank offered rate ("libor"), to the portion of our variable rate debt that is not hedged via an interest rate swap or cap. this was partially offset by a $93 million increase in interest income. the weighted average interest rate for cash interest payments on total borrowings outstanding for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 was 6.2% compared to 5.3% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022.
•refinancing costs. refinancing costs of $56 million incurred for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 were primarily related to third party fees incurred for the refinancing activity completed during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 as summarized in note 12, "debt," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein. refinancing costs of $1 million were incurred for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022.
•other (income) expense. other (income) expense was $(13) million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 compared to $18 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022. other (income) for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 primarily related to a $9 million cash refund received for the esterline retirement plan (the "erp") upon the finalizing of the group annuity purchase funding. refer to note 13, "retirement plans," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information. other expense for fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 was primarily driven by a pension settlement charge of approximately $22 million for the erp. partially offsetting this expense was the non-service related components of benefit costs on the company's benefit plans of $(3) million.
•gain on sale of businesses-net. no gain on sale of businesses-net was recorded for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023. gain on sale of businesses-net of $7 million was recorded for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022, and is primarily related to the net gain on sale recognized on the scioteq and treality simulation visual systems ("scioteq and treality") and technical airborne components ("tac") divestitures. refer to note 2, "acquisitions and divestitures," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information.
•income tax provision. income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 24.3% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 compared to 23.2% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022. the company's higher effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance applicable to the company's net interest deduction limitation carryforward, partially offset by the impact of excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments.
•income from discontinued operations, net of tax. no income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was recorded for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023. income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 and related to a final working capital settlement received on the divestiture of the souriau-sunbank connection technologies business.
•net income attributable to td group. net income attributable to td group increased $432 million, or 49.9%, to $1,298 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 compared to net income attributable to td group of $866 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022, primarily as a result of the factors referenced above.
•earnings per share. basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $22.03 for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 and $13.38 for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022. basic and diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations was $0.02 for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022. there was no impact on earnings per share from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023. net income attributable to td group for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 of $1,298 million was decreased by dividend equivalent payments of $38 million, or $0.67 per share, resulting in net income applicable to td group common stockholders of $1,260 million. net income attributable to td group for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 of $866 million was decreased by dividend equivalent payments of $86 million, or $1.47 per share, resulting in net income applicable to td group common stockholders of $780 million.

net sales for the power & control segment increased $443 million, an increase of 15.4%, for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022. the sales increase resulted primarily from increases in organic sales in the commercial aftermarket ($236 million, an increase of 29.6%), defense ($145 million, an increase of 10.2%) and commercial oem ($86 million, an increase of 16.3%). the increase in commercial aftermarket sales is primarily attributable to the continued recovery in commercial air travel demand and the resulting higher flight hours and utilization of aircraft in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. the increase in defense sales is primarily attributable to slowly improving u.s. government defense spend outlays (though, in management's estimation, the current lag between spend authorizations and outlays remains longer than historical average levels but has improved in the second half of fiscal 2023). the increase in commercial oem sales is primarily attributable to the continued recovery in both narrow-body and wide-body aircraft production and deliveries.
net sales for the airframe segment increased $703 million, an increase of 29.4%, for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022. the sales increase resulted primarily from increases in organic sales in the commercial aftermarket ($259 million, an increase of 33.2%), commercial oem ($181 million, an increase of 29.6%) and defense ($96 million, an increase of 10.8%). the increase in commercial aftermarket sales, commercial oem sales and defense sales for the airframe segment is attributable to the same factors described in the paragraph above for the power & control segment. acquisition sales increased by $171 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 due to the impact of the calspan and dart acquisitions. acquisition sales represent net sales from acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their respective acquisition date.
the change in non-aviation net sales compared to the prior fiscal year was not material.

(1)calculated as a percentage of consolidated net sales.
ebitda as defined for the power & control segment increased approximately $335 million, an increase of 21.9%, resulting from higher organic sales in the commercial aftermarket, commercial oem and defense channels. also contributing to the increase in ebitda as defined was the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies and positive leverage on our fixed overhead costs spread over a higher production volume despite the ongoing inflationary environment for freight, labor and certain raw materials.
ebitda as defined for the airframe segment increased approximately $426 million, an increase of 38.0%. the increase in ebitda as defined for the airframe segment is attributable to the same factors described in the paragraph above for the power & control segment. ebitda as defined for the airframe segment from acquisitions was approximately $48 million due to the impact of the calspan and dart acquisitions. ebitda as defined from acquisitions represents ebitda as defined from acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to the respective acquisition date.
the change in non-aviation ebitda as defined compared to the prior fiscal year was not material.
corporate expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits, professional services and other administrative costs incurred by the corporate offices. an immaterial amount of corporate expenses is allocated to the operating segments. the increase compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily attributable to the deferred compensation plan adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 for certain members of non-executive management.

if the company has excess cash, it generally prioritizes allocating the excess cash in the following manner: (1) capital spending at existing businesses, (2) acquisitions of businesses, (3) payment of a special dividend and/or repurchases of our common stock and (4) prepayment of indebtedness or repurchase of debt.
the company's ability to make scheduled interest payments on, or to refinance, the company's indebtedness, or to fund non-acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on the company's ability to generate cash in the future. this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control.
in fiscal 2023, the company refinanced over $9,800 million of its term loans and notes to extend maturity dates, reduce interest rates (in the case of refinancing the $1,100 million of 8.00% senior secured notes due 2025 - the "2025 secured notes") and transition the benchmark rate of our variable rate debt from based on libor to term sofr. as a result of the refinancing activity, there is no maturity on any tranche of term loans or notes until march 2026.
in connection with the refinancing activity in fiscal 2023, we entered into forward starting interest rate collar agreements aggregating to a notional amount of $1,600 million. for the remaining $4,700 million notional amount of interest rate swaps and cap, we entered into libor to term sofr basis interest rate swap and cap transactions to effectively convert our existing swaps and cap from libor-based to term sofr-based. the basis swaps and cap offset the libor exposure of the existing swaps and cap and effectively fix the term sofr rate for the notional amount.
the company's objective is to maintain an allocation of at least 75% fixed rate and 25% variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. interest rate swaps, caps and collars used to hedge and offset, respectively, the variable interest rates on our term loans are further described in note 21, "derivatives and hedging activities," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein. as of september 30, 2023, approximately 90% of our gross debt was fixed rate.
on july 25, 2023, the company amended the securitization facility to, among other things, increase the borrowing capacity from $350 million to $450 million and extend the maturity date to july 25, 2024 at an interest rate of three-month term sofr plus 1.60%, compared to an interest rate of three-month term sofr plus 1.30% that applied prior to the amendment. the total drawn on the securitization facility remains at $350 million as of september 30, 2023.
also, in fiscal 2023, we used existing cash on hand to fund the $729 million acquisition of calspan, which was completed on may 8, 2023.
as of september 30, 2023, the company has significant cash liquidity as illustrated in the table presented below (in millions):
as of september 30, 2023
cash and cash equivalents                                    $3,472
availability on revolving credit facility                       759
availability on securitization facility                         100
cash liquidity (1)                                           $4,331
(1)when considering the impact of the estimated $2,020 million payment in special dividends and dividend equivalents in november 2023, described below, the pro forma cash liquidity as of september 30, 2023 is $2,311 million.
we believe our significant cash liquidity will allow us to meet our anticipated funding requirements. we expect to meet our short-term cash liquidity requirements (including interest obligations and capital expenditures) through net cash from operating activities, cash on hand and, if needed, draws on the revolving credit facility. long-term cash liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our long-term debt agreements.
in connection with the continued application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers), we expect our efforts will continue to generate strong margins and provide sufficient cash provided by operating activities to meet our interest obligations and liquidity needs. we believe our cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make strategic business acquisitions, pay dividends to our shareholders and make opportunistic investments in our own stock, subject to any restrictions in our existing credit agreement and market conditions.
on november 9, 2023, transdigm announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the electron device business of communications & power industries for approximately $1,385 million in cash. the acquisition is expected to close by the end of transdigm's third quarter of fiscal 2024 and is expected to be financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and new long-term debt.
on november 9, 2023, the company announced that td group's board of directors authorized and declared a special cash dividend of $35.00 on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments on eligible vested options outstanding under its stock option plans. the record date and payment date for the special dividend is november 20, 2023 and november 27, 2023, respectively. the total estimated cash payment, to be funded by existing cash on hand, related to the special dividend and dividend equivalent payments in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 is approximately $2,020 million.
the company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal year 2024 to be approximately 2% to 3% of net sales, which is consistent with its historical annual spend as a percentage of net sales. the company's capital expenditures incurred from year-to-year are funded using existing cash on hand and are primarily for projects that are consistent with our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers).
the company may issue additional debt or refinance existing debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so. in addition, the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions, if cash flow from operating activities becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other short-term cash needs or for common stock repurchases or dividends. our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets.
operating activities. the company generated $1,375 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal 2023 compared to $948 million during fiscal 2022.
the change in trade accounts receivable during fiscal 2023 was a use of cash of $212 million compared to a use of cash of $190 million in fiscal 2022. the increase in the use of cash of $22 million is primarily attributable to the increase in sales volume and related timing of cash receipts. the company continues to actively manage its accounts receivable, the related agings and collection efforts.
the change in inventories during fiscal 2023 was a use of cash of $261 million compared to a use of cash of $134 million in fiscal 2022. the increase in the use of cash of $127 million is primarily driven by increased purchasing from higher demand in fiscal 2023 as raw material inventory is up approximately $185 million compared to at september 30, 2022. the company also continues to actively and strategically manage inventory levels in response to existing ongoing supply chain challenges.
the change in accounts payable during fiscal 2023 was a source of cash of $12 million compared to a source of cash of $58 million in fiscal 2022. the change is due to the timing of payments to suppliers.
investing activities. net cash used in investing activities was $900 million during fiscal 2023, consisting primarily of the acquisition of calspan for approximately $729 million, certain product line acquisitions aggregating to approximately $33 million and capital expenditures of $139 million.
net cash used in investing activities was $553 million during fiscal 2022, consisting primarily of the acquisition of dart for approximately $360 million, certain product line acquisitions aggregating to approximately $62 million and capital expenditures of $119 million. this was slightly offset by $3 million in proceeds received from the final working capital settlement for the scioteq and treality divestiture.
financing activities. net cash used in financing activities was $16 million during fiscal 2023. the use of cash was primarily attributable to repayments on term loans of $7,334 million, which consists of the full repayment of the existing principal for the tranche e, tranche f and tranche g term loans ($7,284 million), plus normal course principal payments on the tranche e, tranche f, tranche h and tranche i term loans ($50 million), the redemptions of the (1) 2025 secured notes for $1,122 million, (2) 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2026 (the "6.375% 2026 notes") for $950 million and (3) 6.875% senior subordinated notes due 2026 (the "6.875% 2026 notes") for $509 million, dividend equivalent payments of $38 million and other financing fees of $20 million. this was primarily offset by the total net proceeds from the issuance of tranche h and tranche i term loans of $6,238 million, net proceeds of $2,068 million from the completion of the 6.75% senior secured notes due 2028 (the "2028 secured notes") offering, net proceeds of $1,436 million from the completion of the 6.875% senior secured notes due 2030 (the "2030 secured notes") offering and $215 million in proceeds from stock option exercises.
net cash used in financing activities was $2,148 million during fiscal 2022. the use of cash was primarily attributable to $1,091 million of dividends and dividend equivalent payments, $912 million in common stock repurchases, the $200 million repayment of a previous draw on the revolving commitments and repayment on term loans of $75 million. this was partially offset by $132 million in proceeds from stock option exercises.

certain restrictive covenants in our debt documents the credit agreement and the indentures governing the subordinated notes and secured notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the payment of special dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, liens and encumbrances, and prepayments of certain other indebtedness.
the restrictive covenants included in the credit agreement are subject to amendments executed periodically. the most recent amendment that impacted the restrictive covenants contained in the credit agreement is amendment no. 11.
under the terms of the credit agreement, transdigm is entitled, on one or more occasions, to request additional term loans or additional revolving commitments to the extent that the existing or new lenders agree to provide such incremental term loans or additional revolving commitments provided that, among other conditions, our consolidated net leverage ratio would be no greater than 7.25x and the consolidated secured net debt ratio would be no greater than 5.00x, in each case, after giving effect to such incremental term loans or additional revolving commitments.
if any such default occurs, the lenders under the credit agreement and the holders of the subordinated notes and secured notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. the lenders under the credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. in addition, following an event of default under the credit agreement or the indentures governing the secured notes, the lenders thereunder or the holders thereof, as applicable, will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash, and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the subordinated notes.
with the exception of the revolving credit facility, the company has no maintenance covenants in its existing term loan and indenture agreements. under the credit agreement, if the usage of the revolving credit facility exceeds 35%, or $284 million, of the total revolving commitments, the company is required to maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of net debt to trailing four-quarter ebitda as defined of 7.25x as of the last day of the fiscal quarter.
as of september 30, 2023, the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants and expects to remain in compliance with its debt covenants in subsequent periods.
trade receivable securitization facility during fiscal 2014, the company established a trade receivable securitization facility (the "securitization facility"). the securitization facility effectively increases the company's borrowing capacity depending on the amount of the domestic operations' trade accounts receivable. the securitization facility includes the right for the company to exercise annual one year extensions as long as there have been no termination events as defined by the agreement. the company uses the proceeds from the securitization facility as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing borrowing costs. the securitization facility is collateralized by substantially all of the company's domestic operations' trade accounts receivable.
on july 25, 2023, the company amended the securitization facility to, among other things, increase the borrowing capacity from $350 million to $450 million and extend the maturity date to july 25, 2024 at an interest rate of three-month term sofr plus 1.60%, compared to an interest rate of three-month term sofr plus 1.30% that applied prior to the amendment. as of september 30, 2023, the total drawn on the securitization facility remains at $350 million. for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022, the applicable interest rate was 6.95% and 3.84%, respectively.

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. however, investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions.
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. for additional significant accounting policies, see note 3, "summary of significant accounting policies," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
revenue recognition - the company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using the five step model prescribed in asc 606. revenue is recognized from the sale of products or services when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of promised goods or services have transferred to the customer. control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain benefits from the goods or services. revenue is measured at the amount of consideration the company expects to be paid in exchange for goods or services. a substantial portion of the company's revenue is recorded at a point in time. sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period. sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided. for agreements with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. the primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service. we consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. these estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time.
inventories - inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the first-in, first-out ("fifo") methods and includes material, labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process. because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be in-service for 25 or more years, it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use. where management estimated that the net realizable value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels, based on historical experience, current and projected market demand, current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions, a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales. additionally, management believes that the company's estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable and material changes in future estimates or assumptions used to calculate our estimate is unlikely. however, actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future. a 10% change in our excess and obsolete inventory reserve at september 30, 2023 would not have a material impact on our results. in accordance with industry practice, all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales, even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year.
goodwill and other intangible assets - in accordance with asc 805, "business combinations," the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized as goodwill. the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, revenue growth rates and ebitda margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. we determine the fair values of intangible assets acquired generally in consultation with third-party valuation advisors. fair value adjustments to the company's assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition.
intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed or exchanged, regardless of the company's intent to do so. goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates.
u.s. gaap requires that the annual, and any interim, goodwill impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level. our reporting units have been identified at the operating unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction. with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit, any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit.
companies may perform a qualitative assessment as the initial step in the annual goodwill impairment testing process for all or selected reporting units. companies are also allowed to bypass the qualitative analysis and perform a quantitative analysis if desired. economic uncertainties and the length of time from the calculation of a baseline fair value are factors that we consider in determining whether to perform a quantitative test.
when we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment using a qualitative assessment, we consider factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance. if, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a quantitative impairment test. for the quantitative test, management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit. if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value, impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist. the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates, revenue growth rates and ebitda margins, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") methodology. the wacc methodology considers market and industry data in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used, inclusive of company-specific risk factors. the company utilizes a third party valuation firm to assist in the determination of the wacc. the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business.
management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates, sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. terminal value rate determination follows a common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low long-term growth rates.
the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values. if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference. management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. in this method, management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset. the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology, inclusive of considering any differences in company-specific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts. management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset. terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low long-term growth rates.
the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed. actual results could differ from these assumptions. management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions.
the company had 49 reporting units with goodwill and 46 reporting units with indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the date of the annual impairment test. based on its initial qualitative assessment over each of the reporting units, the company identified five reporting units to test for impairment using a quantitative test for both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. the reporting units selected for quantitative testing either have higher commercial aerospace content and, as a result, had been more adversely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, or was a recent acquisition. the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets were in excess of their respective carrying values. we believe we incorporate conservative sensitivity ranges on certain company-specific projected data, including earnings before taxes and net sales, which are significant assumptions in the discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value, such that actual results would need to be materially out of the range of the expected assumptions in order for an impairment to occur.
stock-based compensation - the cost of the company's stock-based compensation is recorded in accordance with asc 718, "stock compensation." the company uses a black-scholes pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the stock options awarded. the black-scholes pricing model requires assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the company's common shares, the risk-free interest rate, the expected life of the stock options award and the company's dividend yield. the company primarily utilizes historical data in determining the assumptions. an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management's control could, and do, have an impact on the black-scholes pricing model. the company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data. the total number of stock options expected to vest is adjusted by actual and estimated forfeitures. changes to the actual and estimated forfeitures will result in a cumulative adjustment in the period of change. the company also evaluates any subsequent changes to the respective option holders terms under the modification rules of asc 718. if determined to be a modification, the black-scholes pricing model is updated as of the date of the modification resulting in a cumulative catch-up to expense.
income taxes - the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates. this involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits. to the extent these estimates change, adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur. historically, such adjustments have not been significant.

non-gaap financial measures we present below certain financial information based on our ebitda and ebitda as defined. references to "ebitda" mean earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and references to "ebitda as defined" mean ebitda plus, as applicable for each relevant period, certain adjustments as set forth in the reconciliations of income from continuing operations to ebitda and ebitda as defined and the reconciliations of net cash provided by operating activities to ebitda and ebitda as defined presented below.
neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined is a measurement of financial performance under u.s. gaap. we present ebitda and ebitda as defined because we believe they are useful indicators for evaluating operating performance and liquidity.
our management believes that ebitda and ebitda as defined are useful as indicators of liquidity because securities analysts, investors, rating agencies and others use ebitda to evaluate a company's ability to incur and service debt. in addition, ebitda as defined is useful to investors because the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility requires compliance under certain circumstances, on a pro forma basis, with a financial covenant that measures the ratio of the amount of our secured indebtedness to the amount of our consolidated ebitda defined in the same manner as we define ebitda as defined herein.
in addition to the above, our management uses ebitda as defined to review and assess the performance of the management team in connection with employee incentive programs and to prepare its annual budget and financial projections. moreover, our management uses ebitda as defined to evaluate acquisitions.
although we use ebitda and ebitda as defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above, the use of these non-gaap financial measures as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with u.s. gaap. some of these limitations are:
•neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined reflects the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness;
•although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements;
•the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of ebitda and ebitda as defined;
•neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; and
•ebitda as defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions.
because of these limitations, ebitda and ebitda as defined should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. management compensates for these limitations by not viewing ebitda or ebitda as defined in isolation and specifically by using other u.s. gaap measures, such as net income, net sales and operating profit, to measure our operating performance. neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined is a measurement of financial performance under u.s. gaap, and neither should be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with u.s. gaap. our calculation of ebitda and ebitda as defined may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

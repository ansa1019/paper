key highlights -
•alliant energy's clean energy blueprint, also known as the roadmap for its transition to cleaner energy, continues to add clean energy resources in iowa and wisconsin. as a result, alliant energy directly reinvests in the communities it serves through the addition of skilled jobs, economic development and increased tax revenue. in wisconsin, wpl completed 639 mw of solar generation in 2023, adding to the 250 mw of solar generation placed in service in 2022, and expects to add another 200 mw of solar generation in 2024, resulting in approximately 1,100 mw of solar generation resources in aggregate. in iowa, ipl expects to complete 400 mw of solar generation by the end of 2024. completion of these projects is expected to result in approximately 1,500 mw of additional zero-fuel cost solar generation resources for alliant energy in aggregate by the end of 2024. the execution of alliant energy's strategy is expected to result in cost benefits for its utility customers by continuing to add renewable energy projects that generate fuel cost benefits and renewable tax credits that are provided to its electric customers.
•alliant energy, ipl and wpl currently expect to utilize various provisions of the inflation reduction act of 2022 to enhance tax benefits expected from wind, solar and battery storage projects in iowa and wisconsin, including transferring certain future tax credits from such projects to other corporate taxpayers. the inflation reduction act of 2022 is expected to result in more cost benefits for ipl's and wpl's customers, higher rate base amounts, and improvements in long-term cash flows over the life of the solar, battery storage and wind repowering projects. refer to note 1(c) for discussion of $98 million of proceeds from renewable tax credits transferred to other corporate taxpayers in 2023.
•reductions in iowa corporate income tax rates resulting from tax reform enacted in 2022 are expected to provide cost benefits to ipl's electric and gas customers in the future.
•ipl maintaining flat base rates for its retail electric and gas customers in 2021, 2022 and 2023.
•significant fuel cost reductions achieved in 2021, 2022 and 2023 as a result of shortening the term of ipl's daec ppa by 5 years, and beginning in 2023 with the may 2023 retirement of lansing.
•issuance of new long-term debt at historically low interest rates for ipl ($300 million of 3.1% senior debentures due 2051) and wpl ($300 million of 1.95% green bonds due 2031) in 2021 and wpl ($600 million of 3.95% green bonds due 2032) in 2022.
•in 2023, the u.s. department of energy office of clean energy selected the columbia energy storage project, a first of its kind in the u.s., 20 mw co2-based long-duration energy storage system at the retiring coal-fired columbia site, for award negotiations to receive up to $30 million in grant funding. alliant energy, with support from various project partners, currently expects to submit project plans to the pscw in 2024 after award negotiations with the doe are finished. any grant proceeds would reduce the cost of the project for wpl's customers.
•levelized cost recovery mechanism for the remaining net book value of edgewater unit 5, which helps reduce customer costs.

electric sales for resale - bulk power and other - bulk power and other volume changes were due to changes in sales in the wholesale energy markets operated by miso. these changes are impacted by several factors, including the availability and dispatch of alliant energy's egus and electricity demand within these wholesale energy markets. changes in bulk power and other revenues were largely offset by changes in fuel-related costs, and therefore did not have a significant impact on operating income.
gas transportation/other - gas transportation/other sales volume changes were largely due to changes in the gas volumes supplied to alliant energy's natural gas-fired egus caused by the availability and dispatch of such egus.

(a)alliant energy's sales for resale bulk power and other revenues decreased primarily due to lower prices for electricity sold by ipl and wpl to miso wholesale energy markets. these changes were largely offset by changes in fuel-related costs.
(b)wpl's cost recovery mechanism for retail fuel-related expenses supports deferrals of amounts that fall outside an approved fuel monitoring range of forecasted fuel-related expenses determined by the pscw each year. the difference between revenue collected and actual fuel-related expenses incurred within the fuel monitoring range increases or decreases alliant energy's and wpl's electric utility revenues. wpl estimates the increase (decrease) to electric utility revenues from amounts within the fuel monitoring range were approximately $6 million and ($6) million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. refer to note 2 for discussion of deferred fuel-related costs that were outside the approved fuel monitoring range in 2023, 2022 and 2021.

other future considerations - in addition to items discussed in this report, the following key items could impact alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's future financial condition or results of operations:
•financing plans - alliant energy currently expects to issue up to $25 million of common stock in 2024 through its shareowner direct plan. ipl, wpl and aef currently expect to issue up to $700 million, $300 million and $700 million of long-term debt, respectively, in 2024. ipl and aef have $500 million and $300 million of long-term debt, respectively, maturing in 2024.
•common stock dividends - alliant energy announced a 6% increase in its targeted 2024 annual common stock dividend to $1.92 per share, which is equivalent to a quarterly rate of $0.48 per share, beginning with the february 2024 dividend payment. the timing and amount of future dividends is subject to an approved dividend declaration from alliant energy's board of directors, and is dependent upon earnings expectations, capital requirements, and general financial business conditions, among other factors.
•cash flows from operating activities - alliant energy, ipl and wpl currently expect an increase in future cash flows from operating activities resulting from the transfer of future renewable tax credits to other corporate taxpayers pursuant to the inflation reduction act of 2022. in addition, alliant energy and wpl currently expect an increase in future cash flows from operating activities resulting from higher earnings on increasing rate base at wpl.
•ipl's electric sales trends - in july 2025, ipl's wholesale power agreement with southern minnesota energy cooperative will expire. sales to southern minnesota energy cooperative represented approximately 5% of ipl's total electric sales in 2023.
•higher earnings on increasing rate base - alliant energy and wpl currently expect an increase in earnings in 2024 compared to 2023 due to impacts from increasing revenue requirements related to investments in the utility business.
•depreciation and amortization expense - alliant energy, ipl and wpl currently expect an increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2024 compared to 2023 due to capital projects placed in service in 2023 and 2024 and lower amortization of wpl's west riverside liquidated damages. refer to note 2 for discussion of wpl's west riverside liquidated damages.
•interest expense - alliant energy, ipl and wpl currently expect an increase in interest expense in 2024 compared to 2023 due to financings completed in 2023 and planned in 2024 as discussed above.

•afudc - alliant energy and wpl currently expect a decrease and ipl currently expects an increase in afudc in 2024 compared to 2023 largely due to changes in cwip balances related to construction activity on capital projects.
customer investments alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's strategic priorities include making significant customer-focused investments toward cleaner energy and more reliable, resilient and sustainable customer solutions. these priorities include:
clean energy blueprint alliant energy has developed a clean energy blueprint, or the roadmap for its transition to cleaner energy, as a guide to meet customer demand for affordable, safe, reliable and sustainable energy in iowa and wisconsin. this strategy includes the development and acquisition of additional renewable energy, including approximately 1,100 mw of solar generation at wpl with in-service dates in 2022-2024, approximately 275 mw of battery storage at wpl with in-service dates in 2024 and 2025, and approximately 400 mw of solar generation at ipl with in-service dates in 2024. in order to support reliable and sustainable energy and meet miso's seasonal resource adequacy requirements, alliant energy, ipl and wpl continue to evaluate additional opportunities for renewables and battery storage projects, dispatchable gas generation projects, and distributed energy resources, as well as repowering existing wind farms. estimated capital expenditures for these planned projects for 2024 through 2027 are included in the "renewables and battery storage projects" line in the construction and acquisition table in "liquidity and capital resources."
wpl's generation projects - in 2021 and 2022, wpl received orders from the pscw for its first and second solar cas authorizing wpl to acquire, construct, own, and/or operate 675 mw and 414 mw, respectively, of new solar generation in various wisconsin counties. in 2022 and 2023, 250 mw and 639 mw of solar projects were placed in service, respectively, and a 200 mw solar project is expected to be placed in service in 2024. the 1,089 mw of new solar generation is expected to help replace energy and capacity being eliminated with the planned retirements of the coal-fired edgewater generating station (414 mw) by june 1, 2025, and columbia units 1 and 2 (595 mw in aggregate) by june 1, 2026, which are the last coal-fired egus at wpl.
in june 2023, wpl filed requests with the pscw for approval to construct improvements at the natural gas-fired neenah energy facility and sheboygan falls energy facility, which would increase the capacity and efficiency of the egus. a decision from the pscw is currently expected by the second quarter of 2024.
in august 2023, wpl received an order from the pscw authorizing wpl to construct, own and operate 175 mw of battery storage, with 100 mw and 75 mw at the grant county and wood county solar projects, respectively, which are currently expected to be placed in service in 2024.
in december 2023, wpl received an order from the pscw authorizing wpl to construct, own and operate approximately 99 mw of battery storage at the edgewater generating station, which is currently expected to be placed in service in 2025.
ipl's generation projects - in october 2023, the iub issued an order approving a modified non-unanimous settlement agreement with the iowa office of consumer advocate among other stakeholders, for advance rate-making principles for up to 400 mw of solar generation, subject to a cost target of $1,650/kilowatt, including afudc and transmission upgrade costs among other costs, and a related return on common equity of no less than 10.25% with the opportunity to request a higher return on common equity in future ipl retail electric rate review filings. any reasonable and prudent costs incurred in excess of the cost target are eligible for recovery at the return on common equity determined in ipl retail electric rate review filings. the iub's order also included a consumer protection plan, which monitors ipl's achievement of certain aggregate summer capacity factors for the up to 400 mw of solar generation projects during june, july and august each calendar year over 30 years. actual three-year rolling average summer capacity factors will be compared to target capacity factors, which may result in surpluses or deficits that would be offset against one another and contribute to an accumulated balance in a given calendar year. surpluses or deficits will be capped at $3 million in aggregate per year. at the end of the program, any accumulated deficit balance would be addressed in ipl's next rate review, and any accumulated surplus balance would not result in any return to ipl. in november 2023, ipl accepted these advance rate-making principles.
in 2023, the iub issued gcu certificates granting ipl approval to construct, own and operate up to 150 mw of solar generation at the wever project in lee county, iowa and up to 50 mw of solar generation at the creston project in union county, iowa. these solar projects are included in the iub's october 2023 order approving advance rate-making principles for up to 400 mw of solar generation. the iub also issued gcu certificates granting ipl approval to construct, own and operate up to 100 mw of battery storage (75 mw at the wever project and 25 mw at the creston project), which was not included in the iub's october 2023 order approving advance rate-making principles, and is subject to future regulatory approval.
the 400 mw of new solar generation would help replace a portion of the energy and capacity eliminated with the may 2023 retirement of the coal-fired lansing generating station (275 mw) and the reduction of energy and capacity resulting from the december 2021 fuel switch of the burlington generating station (212 mw) from coal to natural gas. in addition, ipl's plans include additional renewables and distributed energy resources, including community solar and small-scale energy storage systems, and repowering existing wind farms, to add energy and capacity.
table of contents wpl's west riverside natural gas-fired generating station - in 2020, wpl completed the construction of west riverside, a 723 mw natural gas-fired combined-cycle egu in beloit, wisconsin. wpl entered into agreements with neighboring utilities and electric cooperatives that provide each of them options to purchase a partial ownership interest in west riverside. the purchase price for such options is based on the ownership interest acquired and the net book value of west riverside on the date of the purchase. the timing and ownership amount of the options are as follows:
counterparty                                 option amount and timing wec energy group, inc. (wec)                 100 mw were acquired by wec in june 2023 pursuant to pscw and ferc approval; additionally, wec exercised its second and final option to purchase an additional 100 mw, subject to pscw and ferc approval (a)
madison gas and electric company (mge)       25 mw were acquired by mge in march 2023 pursuant to pscw and ferc approval; additionally, mge exercised its second and final option to purchase an additional 25 mw, subject to pscw and ferc approval electric cooperatives                        approximately 60 mw were acquired january 2018
(a)upon wec's exercise of its options, wpl may exercise reciprocal options, subject to approval by the pscw, to purchase up to 200 mw of any natural-gas combined-cycle egu that wec places in service prior to may 2030.
plant retirements and fuel switching - the current strategy includes the retirement, or fuel switch from coal to natural gas, of various egus in the next several years. ipl retired the coal-fired lansing generating station (275 mw) in may 2023, and currently expects to fuel switch or retire prairie creek units 1 and 3 (65 mw in aggregate) by december 31, 2025. wpl currently expects to retire the coal-fired edgewater generating station (414 mw) by june 1, 2025, and columbia units 1 and 2 (595 mw in aggregate) by june 1, 2026. alliant energy, ipl and wpl are working with miso, state regulatory commissions and other regulatory agencies, as required, to determine the timing of these actions, which are subject to change depending on operational, regulatory, market and other factors. refer to note 3 for additional details on these egus.
environmental stewardship - alliant energy's environmental stewardship is focused on meeting its customers' energy needs affordably, safely, reliably and sustainably. alliant energy proactively considers future environmental compliance requirements and proposed regulations in its planning, decision-making, construction and ongoing operations activities. alliant energy is focused on executing a long-term strategy to deliver reliable and affordable energy with lower emissions independent of changing policies and political landscape. to achieve these long-term goals, alliant energy will transition away from coal-fired egus by incorporating renewable energy, distributed energy resources, energy efficiency, demand response, natural gas-fired egus and other technologies such as energy storage.
alliant energy's current voluntary environmental-related goals and achievements include the following:
•exceeded its 2020 targets by reducing air emissions for sulfur dioxide by over 90%, nitrogen oxides by over 80% and mercury by over 90% from 2005 levels.
•by 2030, reduce ghg emissions from its utility operations by 50% from 2005 levels, reduce its electric utility water supply by 75% from 2005 levels and electrify 100% of its owned light-duty fleet vehicles.
•by 2040, eliminate all coal-fired egus from its generating fleet and reduce ghg emissions from its utility operations by 80% from 2005 levels.
•by 2050, aspire to achieve net-zero ghg emissions from its utility operations.
alliant energy's aspirational ghg goal includes epa reportable emissions based on applicable regulatory compliance requirements for co2, methane and nitrous oxide from its owned fossil-fueled egus and distribution of natural gas. in addition, alliant energy's environmental stewardship efforts include a goal to partner to plant more than 1 million trees by the end of 2030. future updates to sustainable energy plans and attaining these goals will depend on future economic developments, evolving energy technologies and emerging trends in alliant energy's service territories.
other customer-focused investments electric and gas distribution systems - customer-focused investments include replacing, modernizing and upgrading infrastructure in the electric and gas distribution systems. electric system investments will focus on areas such as improving reliability and resiliency with more underground electric distribution and enabling distributed energy solutions with higher capacity lines. gas system investments will focus on pipeline replacement to ensure safety and pipeline expansion to support reliability and economic development. estimated capital expenditures for expected and current electric and gas distribution infrastructure projects for 2024 through 2027 are included in the "electric and gas distribution systems" lines in the construction and acquisition expenditures table in "liquidity and capital resources."
fiber optic telecommunication network - alliant energy is currently installing fiber optic routes between its facilities to enhance its communications network to improve resiliency and reliability of, and enable and strengthen, the integrated grid network focused on less densely populated rural areas.
table of contents gas pipeline expansion - ipl and wpl currently expect to make investments to extend various gas distribution systems to provide natural gas to unserved or underserved areas in their service territories.
gas pipeline safety - the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration published various final rules from 2019 through 2022 that updated safety requirements for gas transmission pipelines, and updated procedures were implemented to address these rules. plans to address certain requirements for specific pipelines were developed and implemented, with identified remediation efforts to be completed by july 2035. in anticipation of these rule changes, alliant energy, ipl and wpl have been proactively replacing certain of ipl's transmission pipelines, making modifications to certain of wpl's transmission pipelines, and updating practices for assessment and operation of these pipelines. alliant energy, ipl, and wpl also continue to evaluate the impact of these final rules and resulting remediation plans on their financial condition and results of operations.
technology - alliant energy, ipl and wpl currently plan to make investments in technology to enhance productivity and efficiency through automation, customer self-service and telework. estimated capital expenditures for expected and current technology projects for 2024 through 2027 are included in the "other" line in the construction and acquisition expenditures table in "liquidity and capital resources."
non-utility business - alliant energy continues to explore growth of its travero businesses and other limited scope opportunities outside of, but complementary to, alliant energy's core utility business. this non-utility strategy continues to evolve through exploration of modest strategic opportunities that are accretive to earnings and cash flows.
rate matters rate reviews retail base rate filings - base rate changes reflect both returns on additions to infrastructure and recovery of changes in costs incurred or expected to be incurred to provide electric and gas service to retail customers. given that a portion of the rate changes will offset changes in costs, revenues from rate changes should not be expected to result in an equal change in net income for either ipl or wpl.
wpl's retail electric and gas rate reviews (2024/2025 forward-looking test period) - in december 2023, the pscw issued an order authorizing annual base rate increases of $49 million and $13 million for wpl's retail electric and gas customers, respectively, effective january 1, 2024, for the 2024 forward-looking test period. the pscw's order also authorized wpl to implement an additional $60 million increase in annual rates for its retail electric customers, effective january 1, 2025, for the 2025 forward-looking test period. the key drivers for the annual base rate increases include revenue requirement impacts of increasing electric and gas rate base, including investments in solar generation and battery storage. the order extends, with certain modifications, an earnings sharing mechanism through 2025. under the earnings sharing mechanism, wpl will defer a portion of its earnings if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeds 9.95% during the 2024/2025 test period. wpl must defer 50% of its excess earnings between 9.95% and 10.55%, and 100% of any excess earnings above 10.55%. the pscw also authorized wpl to defer the incremental under-/over-collection of solar and battery storage renewable tax credits that are outside of the approved amounts. in addition, the pscw authorized continued recovery of and a return on the remaining net book value of edgewater unit 5, which is currently expected to be retired by june 1, 2025. refer to note 3 for details of the pscw's february 2024 oral decision approving wpl's deferral request to seek recovery of solar generation construction costs that exceed amounts previously approved by the pscw in a future regulatory proceeding.
ipl's retail electric and gas rate reviews (october 2024 through september 2025 forward-looking test period) - in october 2023, ipl filed a retail electric and gas rate review with the iub for the october 2024 through september 2025 forward-looking test period. the key drivers for the filing include revenue requirement impacts of increasing electric and gas rate base, including investments in solar generation and repowering of the existing franklin county wind farm, as well as certain incremental costs and benefits incurred resulting from the 2020 derecho windstorm. the filing requested approval for ipl to implement increases in annual rates for its retail electric and gas customers of $160 million and $14 million, respectively, with any granted rate changes expected to be effective on october 1, 2024. ipl's filing also requested approval to implement an additional $124 million increase in annual rates for its retail electric customers in 2025, with any granted rate changes expected to be effective on october 1, 2025. ipl also requested a return on common equity of 10% and a 52% common equity component of its regulatory capital structure, as well as to receive continued recovery of and a return on the remaining net book value of the lansing generating station through 2037, which was retired in may 2023. a decision from the iub is currently expected in the third quarter of 2024.
wpl's retail fuel-related rate filing (2022 forward-looking test period) - in august 2023, the pscw authorized wpl to collect $117 million in higher rates, plus interest, from its retail electric customers from october 2023 through december 2025 for fuel-related costs incurred by wpl in 2022 that were higher than fuel-related costs used to determine rates for such period.
wpl's retail fuel-related rate filing (2023 forward-looking test period) - in december 2022, the pscw authorized wpl to collect $47 million in higher rates in 2023 from its retail electric customers to reflect an increase in expected fuel-related costs for 2023 compared to wpl's approved 2022 fuel-related costs.

legislative matters in august 2022, the inflation reduction act of 2022 was enacted. the most significant provisions of the new legislation for alliant energy, ipl and wpl relate to a 10-year extension of tax credits for clean energy projects, a new production tax credit for eligible solar projects, a new stand-alone investment tax credit for battery storage projects and the right to transfer renewable tax credits generated after 2022 to other corporate taxpayers. the new legislation also includes a requirement for corporations with income over $1 billion to pay a 15% minimum tax; however, alliant energy is currently below this income level. alliant energy, ipl and wpl are utilizing various provisions of the new legislation to enhance the tax benefits expected from their announced solar and battery storage projects, including transferring the future tax credits from such projects to other corporate taxpayers, as well as the repowering of existing wind farms. the impact of these changes is expected to result in more cost benefits for ipl's and wpl's customers, higher rate base amounts, additional financing needs expected to be satisfied with additional long-term debt and common stock issuances, and improvements in long-term cash flows over the life of the solar, battery storage and wind repowering projects. refer to note 1(c) for discussion of the transfer of renewable tax credits to other corporate taxpayers in 2023.
refer to note 12 for discussion of iowa tax reform enacted in march 2022.
in november 2021, the infrastructure investment and jobs act (iija act) was enacted. the most significant provisions of the iija act for alliant energy relate to a variety of infrastructure-related priorities, including transportation, environmental, energy and broadband infrastructure. in addition, the iija act is intended to accelerate research, development, demonstration and deployment of carbon-free technologies, including hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.
in march 2021, the american rescue plan act of 2021 (act) was enacted. the most significant provision of the act for alliant energy is reduced minimum pension plan funding requirements, which alliant energy adopted in august 2021. the act also provides additional funding to the low income home energy assistance program, which assists certain of alliant energy's customers with managing their energy costs, as well as provides financial support for certain of alliant energy's residential, small business and non-profit customers.

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview - alliant energy, ipl and wpl expect to maintain adequate liquidity to operate their businesses and implement their strategy as a result of operating cash flows generated by their utility business, and available capacity under a single revolving credit facility and ipl's sales of accounts receivable program, supplemented by periodic issuances of long-term debt and alliant energy equity securities. as summarized below, alliant energy, ipl and wpl believe they have the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet their requirements and plans for cash in the next 12 months and beyond.
liquidity position - at december 31, 2023, alliant energy had $62 million of cash and cash equivalents, $525 million ($293 million at the parent company, $150 million at ipl and $82 million at wpl) of available capacity under the single revolving credit facility and $4 million of available capacity at ipl under its sales of accounts receivable program.
capital structure - alliant energy, ipl and wpl plan to maintain debt-to-total capitalization ratios that are consistent with investment-grade credit ratings. ipl and wpl expect to maintain capital structures consistent with the authorized levels approved by regulators. financial capital structures as of december 31, 2023 were as follows (common equity (ce); long-term debt (including current maturities) (ld); short-term debt (sd)):
alliant energy, ipl and wpl intend to manage their capital structures and liquidity positions in such a way that facilitates their ability to raise funds reliably and on reasonable terms and conditions, while maintaining capital structures consistent with those approved by regulators. in addition to capital structures, other important factors used to determine the characteristics of future financings include financial coverage ratios, capital spending plans, regulatory orders and rate-making considerations, levels of debt imputed by rating agencies, market conditions, the impact of tax initiatives and legislation, and any potential proceeds from asset sales. the pscw factors certain imputed debt adjustments, including certain lease obligations, in establishing a regulatory capital structure as part of wpl's retail rate reviews. the iub does not make any explicit adjustments for imputed debt in establishing capital ratios used in determining customer rates, although such adjustments are considered by ipl in recommending an appropriate capital structure. debt imputations by rating agencies include, among others, pension and opeb obligations, the sales of accounts receivable program and certain lease obligations.
credit and capital markets - alliant energy, ipl and wpl maintain a single revolving credit facility to provide backstop liquidity to their commercial paper programs, and ensure a committed source of liquidity in the event the commercial paper market becomes disrupted. in addition, ipl maintains a sales of accounts receivable program as an alternative financing source; however, if customer arrears were to exceed certain levels, ipl's access to the program may be restricted.
primary sources and uses of cash - alliant energy's most significant source of cash is from electric and gas sales to ipl's and wpl's customers. cash from these sales reimburses ipl and wpl for prudently-incurred expenses to provide service to their utility customers and generally provides ipl and wpl a return of and a return on the assets used to provide such services. capital needed to retire debt and fund capital expenditures related to large strategic projects is expected to be met primarily through external financings.

ferc and public utility holding company act financing authorizations - under the public utility holding company act of 2005, ferc has authority over the issuance of utility securities, except to the extent that a public utility's primary state regulatory commission has retained jurisdiction over such matters. ferc currently has authority over the issuance of securities by ipl. ferc does not have authority over the issuance of securities by alliant energy, wpl, aef or corporate services. in 2023, ipl received authorization from ferc to issue securities in 2024 and 2025 as follows (in millions):
long-term debt securities issuances in aggregate                                                      $1,700

state regulatory financing authorizations - in march 2023, wpl received authorization from the pscw to have up to $500 million of short-term borrowings and/or letters of credit outstanding at any time through the expiration date of wpl's credit facility agreement. as of december 31, 2023, wpl also had authority to issue up to $900 million of long-term debt securities in aggregate through december 2025 pursuant to a february 2023 pscw order.
shelf registrations - alliant energy, ipl and wpl have current shelf registration statements on file with the sec for availability to issue unspecified amounts of securities through december 2026. alliant energy's shelf registration statement may be used to issue common stock, debt and other securities. ipl's and wpl's shelf registration statements may be used to issue preferred stock and debt securities.
table of contents common stock dividends - payment of common stock dividends is subject to dividend declaration by alliant energy's board of directors and is dependent upon, among other factors, regulatory limitations, earnings, cash flows, capital requirements and general financial condition of subsidiaries. alliant energy's general long-term goal is to maintain a dividend payout ratio that is competitive with the industry average. based on that, alliant energy's goal is to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately 60% to 70% of consolidated earnings from continuing operations. refer to "results of operations" for discussion of expected common stock dividends in 2024.
common stock issuances - refer to note 7 for discussion of common stock issuances by alliant energy in 2022 and 2023, and "results of operations" for discussion of expected issuances of common stock in 2024.
short-term debt - in january 2024, alliant energy, ipl and wpl extended their single revolving credit facility agreement, which expires in december 2028 and is discussed in note 9(a). there are currently 13 lenders that participate in the credit facility, with respective commitments ranging from $20 million to $130 million. subject to certain conditions, alliant energy, ipl and wpl may exercise one extension option, which would extend the maturity date by one year. the credit facility has a provision to expand the facility size up to an additional $300 million, for a potential total commitment of $1.3 billion, subject to lender approval for alliant energy and subject to lender and regulatory approvals for ipl and wpl.
the credit agreement contains customary events of default, including a cross-default provision that would be triggered if alliant energy or certain of its significant subsidiaries (including ipl and wpl) defaults on debt (other than non-recourse debt) totaling $100 million or more. ipl and wpl are subject to a similar cross-default provision with respect to their own respective consolidated debt. a default by alliant energy or its non-utility subsidiaries would not trigger a cross-default at ipl or wpl, nor would a default by either of ipl or wpl constitute a cross-default event for the other. if an event of default under the credit agreement occurs and is continuing, then the lenders may declare any outstanding obligations of the defaulting borrower under the credit agreement immediately due and payable.
the single credit facility agreement contains a financial covenant, which requires alliant energy, ipl and wpl to maintain certain debt-to-capital ratios in order to borrow under the credit facility. aef's term loan credit agreement contains a financial covenant, which requires alliant energy to maintain a certain debt-to-capital ratio in order to borrow under the term loan credit agreement. the required debt-to-capital ratios compared to the actual debt-to-capital ratios at december 31, 2023 were as follows:
alliant energy         ipl         wpl requirement, not to exceed                      65%         65%         65%
actual                                          59%         50%         48%
the debt component of the capital ratios includes, when applicable, long- and short-term debt (excluding non-recourse debt and hybrid securities to the extent the total carrying value of such hybrid securities does not exceed 15% of consolidated capital of the applicable borrower), finance lease obligations, certain letters of credit, guarantees of the foregoing and new synthetic leases. unfunded vested benefits under qualified pension plans and sales of accounts receivable are not included in the debt-to-capital ratios. the equity component of the capital ratios excludes accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
long-term debt - refer to note 9(b) for discussion of issuances and retirements of long-term debt in 2023, and "results of operations" for discussion of expected issuances and retirements of long-term debt in 2024. in 2022, wpl issued $600 million of 3.95% green bond debentures due 2032, and an amount in excess of the net proceeds was disbursed for the development and acquisition of wpl's solar egus. in 2022, aef entered into a $300 million variable rate term loan credit agreement and used the borrowings under this agreement to retire its $300 million variable rate term loan credit agreement that expired in 2022. in 2022, aef increased the amount outstanding under the new term loan credit agreement by $100 million and used the additional borrowings to reduce alliant energy's outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. in 2022, aef issued $350 million of 3.6% senior notes due 2032 and used the net proceeds to reduce alliant energy's outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.
impact of credit ratings on liquidity and collateral obligations -
ratings triggers - the long-term debt of alliant energy and its subsidiaries is not subject to any repayment requirements as a result of explicit credit rating downgrades or so-called "ratings triggers." however, alliant energy and its subsidiaries are parties to various agreements that contain provisions dependent on credit ratings. in the event of a significant downgrade, alliant energy or its subsidiaries may need to provide credit support, such as letters of credit or cash collateral equal to the amount of any exposure, or may need to unwind contracts or pay underlying obligations. in the event of a significant downgrade, management believes alliant energy, ipl and wpl have sufficient liquidity to cover counterparty credit support or collateral requirements under these various agreements. in addition, a downgrade in the credit ratings of alliant energy, ipl or wpl could also result in them paying higher interest rates in future financings, reduce flexibility with future financing plans, reduce their pool of potential lenders, increase their borrowing costs under existing credit facilities or limit their access to the commercial paper market. credit ratings and outlooks as of the date of this report are as follows:

off-balance sheet arrangements -
special purpose entities - ipl maintains a receivables agreement whereby it may sell its customer accounts receivables, unbilled revenues and certain other accounts receivables to a third party through wholly-owned and consolidated special purpose entities. the purchase commitment from the third party to which ipl sells its receivables expires in march 2024. ipl currently expects to amend and extend the purchase commitment. in 2023 and 2022, ipl evaluated the third party that purchases ipl's receivable assets under the receivables agreement and believes that the third party is a vie; however, ipl concluded consolidation of the third party was not required.
in addition, ipl's sales of accounts receivable program agreement contains a cross-default provision that is triggered if ipl or alliant energy incurs an event of default on debt totaling $100 million or more. if an event of default under ipl's sales of accounts receivable program agreement occurs, then the counterparty could terminate such agreement. refer to note 5(b) for additional information regarding ipl's sales of accounts receivable program.
guarantees and indemnifications - at december 31, 2023, various guarantees and indemnifications are outstanding related to alliant energy's cash equity ownership interest in a non-utility wind farm, prior divestiture activities and transfers of renewable tax credits to other corporate taxpayers. refer to note 17(d) for additional information.
certain financial commitments -
contractual obligations - alliant energy, ipl and wpl have various long-term contractual obligations as of december 31, 2023, which include long-term debt maturities in note 9(b), operating and finance leases in note 10, capital purchase obligations in note 17(a), and other purchase obligations in note 17(b). at december 31, 2023, alliant energy, ipl and wpl had no uncertain tax positions recorded as liabilities. refer to note 13(a) for anticipated pension and opeb funding amounts. refer to "construction and acquisition expenditures" above for additional information on construction and acquisition programs. in addition, at december 31, 2023, there were various other liabilities included on the balance sheets that, due to the nature of the liabilities, the timing of payments cannot be estimated.
other matters market risk sensitive instruments and positions - primary market risk exposures are associated with commodity prices, counterparty credit risk, investment prices and interest rates. risk management policies are used to monitor and assist in mitigating these market risks and derivative instruments are used to manage some of the exposures related to commodity prices and interest rates. refer to notes 1(h) and 15 for further discussion of derivative instruments, and note 1(g) for details of utility cost recovery mechanisms that significantly reduce commodity risk.
commodity price - alliant energy, ipl and wpl are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of commodities they procure and market. established policies and procedures mitigate risks associated with these market fluctuations, including the use of various commodity derivatives and contracts of various durations for the forward sale and purchase of these commodities. exposure to commodity price risks in the utility businesses is also significantly mitigated by current rate-making structures in place for recovery of fuel-related costs as well as the cost of natural gas purchased for resale. ipl's electric and gas tariffs and wpl's wholesale electric and gas tariffs provide for subsequent monthly adjustments to their tariff rates for material changes in prudently incurred commodity costs. ipl's and wpl's rate mechanisms, combined with commodity derivatives, significantly reduce commodity risk associated with their electric and gas

table of contents service. wpl's retail electric service is exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices due largely to the current retail recovery mechanism in place in wisconsin for fuel-related costs.
counterparty credit risk - alliant energy, ipl, and wpl are exposed to credit risk related to losses resulting from counterparties' nonperformance of their contractual obligations. alliant energy, ipl and wpl maintain credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations. alliant energy, ipl, and wpl conduct credit reviews for certain counterparties, and employ credit risk controls such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, master netting agreements and termination provisions. credit exposure is monitored, and when necessary, activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided. distress in the financial markets could increase alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's credit risk.
investment price - alliant energy, ipl and wpl are exposed to investment price risk as a result of their investments in securities, largely related to securities held by their pension and opeb plans, as well as unconsolidated investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting. refer to note 13(a) for details of the securities held by their pension and opeb plans, and note 6 for details of equity investments. refer to "critical accounting estimates" for the impact on retirement plan costs of changes in the rate of returns earned by plan assets.
interest rate - alliant energy, ipl and wpl are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates associated with variable-rate borrowings. in addition, alliant energy and ipl are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates on cash amounts outstanding under ipl's sales of accounts receivable program. assuming the impact of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates on variable-rate borrowings and cash amounts outstanding under ipl's sales of accounts receivable program at december 31, 2023, alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's annual pre-tax expense would increase by approximately $5 million, $0 and $3 million, respectively. refer to notes 5(b) and 9 for additional information on cash amounts outstanding under ipl's sales of accounts receivable program, and short- and long-term variable-rate borrowings, respectively. refer to "critical accounting estimates" for the impacts of changes in discount rates on retirement plan obligations and costs.
critical accounting estimates - alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap, which requires management to apply accounting policies, judgments and assumptions, and make estimates that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. the following accounting estimates are critical to the business and the understanding of financial results as they require critical assumptions and judgments by management. the results of these assumptions and judgments form the basis for making estimates regarding the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual financial results may differ materially from estimates. management has discussed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors. refer to note 1 for additional discussion of accounting estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.
regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities - ipl and wpl are regulated by various federal and state regulatory agencies. as a result, they are subject to gaap for regulated operations, which recognizes that the actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or liability. regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities arise as a result of a difference between gaap and actions imposed by the regulatory agencies in the rate-making process. regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred as such costs are probable of recovery in future customer rates. regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers or amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred. regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recognized in accordance with the rulings of applicable federal and state regulators, and future regulatory rulings may impact the carrying value and accounting treatment of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities. note 2 provides details of the nature and amounts of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities assessed at december 31, 2023.
assumptions and judgments are made each reporting period regarding whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery and regulatory liabilities are probable future obligations by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes, rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory agencies, historical decisions by such regulatory agencies regarding similar regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, and subsequent events of such regulatory agencies. the decisions made by regulatory authorities have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. a change in these decisions may result in a material impact on results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
in may 2023, ipl retired the lansing generating station. ipl is currently allowed a full recovery of and a full return on this egu from both its retail and wholesale customers, and ipl's retail electric rate review for the october 2024 through september 2025 forward-looking test period includes a request for continued recovery of and a return on the remaining net book value of lansing through 2037. as a result, alliant energy and ipl concluded that no impairment was required as of december 31, 2023.
table of contents income taxes - alliant energy, ipl and wpl are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. assumptions and judgments are made each reporting period to estimate income tax assets, liabilities, benefits and expenses. judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections. significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations. alliant energy's and ipl's critical assumptions and judgments for 2023 included estimates of qualifying deductions for repairs expenditures and allocation of mixed service costs due to the impact of iowa rate-making principles on such property-related differences. critical assumptions and judgments also include projections of future taxable income used to determine the ability to utilize federal credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. refer to note 12 for further discussion of tax matters.
effect of rate-making on property-related differences - alliant energy's and ipl's effective income tax rates are normally impacted by certain property-related differences at ipl for which deferred tax is not recorded in the income statement pursuant to iowa rate-making principles. changes in methods or assumptions regarding the amount of ipl's qualifying repairs expenditures, allocation of mixed service costs, and costs related to retirement or removal of depreciable property could result in a material impact on alliant energy's and ipl's financial condition and results of operations.
carryforward utilization - significant federal tax credit carryforwards exist for alliant energy, ipl and wpl as of december 31, 2023. based on projections of current and future taxable income, alliant energy, ipl and wpl plan to utilize all of these carryforwards more than five years before expiration. changes in tax regulations or assumptions regarding current and future taxable income could require valuation allowances in the future resulting in a material impact on financial condition and results of operations.
long-lived assets - periodic assessments regarding the recoverability of certain long-lived assets are completed when factors indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or such assets are planned to be sold. these assessments require significant assumptions and judgments by management. the long-lived assets assessed for impairment generally include certain assets within regulated operations that may not be fully recovered from ipl's and wpl's customers as a result of regulatory decisions in the future, and assets within non-utility operations that are proposed to be sold or are currently generating operating losses.
regulated operations - alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's long-lived assets within their regulated operations that were assessed for impairment and/or plant abandonment in 2023 included wpl's generating units subject to early retirement, and ipl's and wpl's solar generation projects recently completed or under construction.
generating units subject to early retirement - alliant energy, ipl and wpl evaluate future plans for their electric generation fleet and have announced the early retirement of certain egus. when it becomes probable that an egu will be retired before the end of its useful life, alliant energy, ipl and wpl must assess whether the egu meets the criteria to be considered probable of abandonment. egus that are considered probable of abandonment generally have material remaining net book values and are expected to cease operations in the near term significantly before the end of their original estimated useful lives. if an egu meets such criteria to be considered probable of abandonment, alliant energy, ipl and wpl must assess the probability of full recovery of the remaining carrying value of such egu. if it is probable that regulators will not allow full recovery of and a full return on the remaining net book value of the abandoned egu, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the difference between the remaining carrying value and the present value of the future revenues expected from the abandoned egu.
alliant energy and wpl concluded that edgewater unit 5 (expected to be retired by june 1, 2025) and columbia units 1 and 2 (expected to be retired by june 1, 2026), met the criteria to be considered probable of abandonment as of december 31, 2023. wpl is currently allowed a full recovery of and a full return on these egus from both its retail and wholesale customers, and as a result, alliant energy and wpl concluded that no impairment was required as of december 31, 2023. alliant energy, ipl and wpl evaluated their other egus that are subject to early retirement and determined that no other egus met the criteria to be considered probable of abandonment as of december 31, 2023. note 3 provides additional details on these egus.
solar generation projects recently completed or under construction - alliant energy, ipl and wpl review property, plant and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate all or a portion of the carrying value of the assets may be disallowed for rate-making purposes. if ipl or wpl is disallowed recovery of any portion of, or is only allowed a partial return on, the carrying value of the solar generation projects recently completed or under construction, then an impairment charge is recognized. "customer investments" provides details of ipl's and wpl's solar generation projects recently completed or under construction.
ipl accepted the iub's advance rate-making principles approved in october 2023 for 400 mw of solar generation. ipl currently expects estimated construction costs associated with the 400 mw of new solar generation will exceed the cost target of $1,650/kilowatt, including afudc and transmission upgrade costs among other costs, approved by the iub by approximately 10%. alliant energy and ipl concluded that there was not a probable disallowance of anticipated higher rate base amounts as of december 31, 2023 given construction costs were reasonably and prudently incurred.
wpl previously received authorization from the pscw to acquire, construct, own and/or operate approximately 1,100 mw of new solar generation. alliant energy and wpl currently expect estimated construction costs associated with this solar table of contents generation will exceed amounts previously approved by the pscw by approximately $180 million. in december 2023, the pscw issued an order authorizing annual base rate increases for wpl's retail electric customers for the 2024/2025 forward-looking test period, which did not include revenue requirement for the estimated construction costs that exceed amounts previously approved by the pscw. in february 2024, the pscw issued an oral decision approving wpl's deferral request to seek recovery of these costs in a future regulatory proceeding. alliant energy and wpl concluded that there was not a probable disallowance of anticipated higher rate base amounts as of december 31, 2023 given construction costs were reasonably and prudently incurred.
pensions and other postretirement benefits - alliant energy, ipl and wpl sponsor various defined benefit pension and opeb plans that provide benefits to a significant portion of their employees and retirees. assumptions and judgments are made periodically to estimate the obligations and costs related to their retirement plans. there are many judgments and assumptions involved in determining an entity's pension and other postretirement liabilities and costs each period including employee demographics (including life expectancies and compensation levels), discount rates, assumed rates of return and funding. changes made to plan provisions may also impact current and future benefits costs. judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed at least annually. the following table shows the impacts of changing certain key actuarial assumptions discussed above (in millions):

contingencies - assumptions and judgments are made each reporting period regarding the future outcome of contingent events. loss contingency amounts are recorded for any contingent events for which the likelihood of loss is probable and able to be reasonably estimated based upon current available information. the amounts recorded may differ from actuals when the uncertainty is resolved. the estimates made in accounting for contingencies, and the gains and losses that are recorded upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties, could have a significant effect on results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
certain contingencies, such as alliant energy resources, llc's guarantees of the partnership obligations of an affiliate of whiting petroleum, require estimation each reporting period of the expected credit losses on those contingencies, which requires significant judgment and may result in the recognition of a credit loss liability. with respect to alliant energy's guarantees of the partnership obligations of an affiliate of whiting petroleum, the most significant judgments in determining the credit loss liability were the estimate of the exposure under the guarantees and the methodology used for calculating the credit loss liability. as of december 31, 2023, alliant energy currently estimates the exposure to be a portion of the known partnership abandonment obligations. the methodology used to determine the credit loss liability considers both quantitative and qualitative information, which utilizes potential outcomes in a range of possible estimated amounts. factors considered include market and external data points, the creditworthiness of the other partners, whiting petroleum's emergence from bankruptcy in 2020 as well as subsequent bankruptcy developments, payments by whiting petroleum related to abandonment obligations, forecasted cash flow expenditures associated with the abandonment obligations based on information made available to alliant energy, and whiting petroleum's business combination with oasis petroleum inc. in 2022.
note 17 provides further discussion of contingencies assessed at december 31, 2023 that may have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations, including various pending legal proceedings, guarantees and indemnifications.

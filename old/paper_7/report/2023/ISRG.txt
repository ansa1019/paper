item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview open surgery remains the predominant form of surgery and is used in almost every area of the body. however, the large incisions required for open surgery create trauma to patients, typically resulting in longer hospitalization and recovery times, increased hospitalization costs, and additional pain and suffering relative to minimally invasive surgery, where mis is available. for over three decades, mis has reduced trauma to patients by allowing selected surgeries to be performed through small ports rather than large incisions. mis has been widely adopted for certain surgical procedures.
da vinci surgical systems enable surgeons to extend the benefits of mis to many patients who would otherwise undergo a more invasive surgery by using computational, robotic, and imaging technologies to overcome many of the limitations of traditional open surgery or conventional mis. surgeons using a da vinci surgical system operate while seated comfortably at a console viewing a 3d, high-definition image of the surgical field. this immersive console connects surgeons to the surgical field and their instruments. while seated at the console, the surgeon manipulates instrument controls in a natural manner, similar to open surgical technique. our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of articulation of the surgical instruments used in the surgical field analogous to the motions of a human wrist, while filtering out the tremor inherent in a surgeon's hand. in designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy and safe to use.
our da vinci products fall into five broad categories: da vinci surgical systems, da vinci instruments and accessories, da vinci stapling, da vinci energy, and da vinci vision, including firefly fluorescence imaging systems and da vinci endoscopes. we also provide a comprehensive suite of systems, learning, and services offerings. digitally-enabled for nearly three decades, these three offerings aim to decrease variability by providing dependable, consistent functionality and an integrated user experience. our systems category includes robotic platforms, software, vision, energy, and instruments and accessories. our learning category includes educational technology, such as simulation and telepresence, as well as technical training programs and personalized peer-to-peer learning opportunities. our services category assists and optimizes minimally invasive programs through readiness, on-demand support, consultation for minimally invasive program optimization, and hospitals customized analytics. within our integrated ecosystem, our focus is to decrease variability in surgery by offering actionable insights, with digital solutions, to take action with the potential to improve outcomes, personalize learning, and optimize efficiency. we take a holistic approach, offering intelligent technology and systems designed to work together to make mis intervention more available and applicable.
we have commercialized the following da vinci surgical systems: the da vinci standard surgical system in 1999, the da vinci s surgical system in 2006, the da vinci si surgical system in 2009, and the fourth generation da vinci xi surgical system in 2014. we extended our fourth-generation platform by adding the da vinci x surgical system, commercialized in 2017, and the da vinci sp surgical system, commercialized in 2018. the da vinci sp surgical system accesses the body through a single incision, while the other da vinci surgical systems access the body through multiple incisions. all da vinci systems include a surgeon's console (or consoles), imaging electronics, a patient-side cart, and computational hardware and software. we are in the early stages of launching our da vinci sp surgical system, and we have an installed base of 177 da vinci sp surgical systems as of december 31, 2023. we have received fda clearance for the da vinci sp surgical system for urologic and certain transoral procedures, and we have received regulatory clearance in south korea, where the da vinci sp surgical system may be used for a broad set of procedures. in september 2022, we received regulatory clearance for the da vinci sp surgical system in japan for the same set of procedures as can be performed on the da vinci xi surgical system in japan. in january 2024, we obtained the european certification in accordance with 2017/745 eu mdr (medical devices regulation) for our da vinci sp surgical system for use in endoscopic abdominopelvic, thoracoscopic, transoral otolaryngology, transanal colorectal, and breast surgical procedures. we plan to commercialize the da vinci sp surgical system in select major european countries throughout 2024 as part of a measured rollout strategy. we plan to seek fda clearances for additional indications for the da vinci sp surgical system over time. we also plan to seek clearances (including for additional indications) in other ous markets over time. the success of the da vinci sp surgical system is dependent on positive experiences and improved clinical outcomes for the procedures for which it has been cleared as well as securing additional clinical clearances.
in addition, we have submitted regulatory filings in the u.s., japan, and south korea for our fifth-generation multi-port platform, da vinci 5. if we obtain the required regulatory clearances, we plan a phased launch over several quarters after clearance, giving us time to mature our supply and manufacturing processes for the new system.
we offer approximately 70 different multi-port da vinci instruments to provide surgeons with flexibility in choosing the types of tools needed to perform a particular surgery. these multi-port instruments are generally robotically controlled and provide end effectors (tips) that are similar to those used in either open or laparoscopic surgery. we offer advanced instrumentation for the da vinci x and da vinci xi platforms, including da vinci energy and da vinci stapler products, to provide surgeons with sophisticated, computer-aided tools to precisely and efficiently interact with tissue. the da vinci x and da vinci xi surgical systems share the same instruments, whereas the da vinci si surgical system uses instruments that are not table of contents compatible with the da vinci x or da vinci xi systems. we currently offer nine core instruments on our da vinci sp surgical system. we plan to expand the da vinci sp instrument offering over time.
training technologies include our intuitive simulation products, our intuitive telepresence remote case observation and telementoring tools, and our dual console for use in surgeon proctoring and collaborative surgery.
in 2019, the fda cleared our ion endoluminal system, which is a flexible, robotic-assisted, catheter-based platform that utilizes instruments and accessories for which the first cleared indication is minimally invasive biopsies in the lung. our ion system extends our commercial offering beyond surgery into diagnostic endoluminal procedures. the system features an ultra-thin, ultra-maneuverable catheter that can articulate 180 degrees in all directions and allows navigation far into the peripheral lung and provides the stability necessary for precision in a biopsy. many suspicious lesions found in the lung may be small and difficult to access, which can make diagnosis challenging, and ion helps physicians obtain tissue samples from deep within the lung, which could help enable earlier diagnosis. in march 2023, we obtained the european certification in accordance with 2017/745 eu mdr (medical devices regulation) for our ion endoluminal system and, in september 2023, we received regulatory clearance for our ion endoluminal system in south korea. we plan to seek additional clearances, approvals, and certifications for the ion endoluminal system in ous markets over time.
the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, pricing, competition, market and consumer acceptance, the effective forecasting and management of product demand, inventory levels, the management of manufacturing and supply costs, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction.
macroeconomic environment uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic and geopolitical factors in the u.s. and globally characterized by the supply chain environment, inflationary pressure, higher interest rates, instability in the global financial markets, significant disruptions in the commodities' markets as a result of the conflict between russia and ukraine and the conflict between israel and hamas, labor shortages, and the introduction of or changes in tariffs or trade barriers may result in a recession, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
supply chain constraints continued to show improvement as 2023 progressed, relative to 2022, based on fewer market constraints. notably, supply of semiconductor materials rebounded, while certain residual stresses remain. additionally, prices of such materials remain elevated due to either market demand or production-related cost inflation. with higher interest rates, access to credit may become more difficult and any insolvency of certain suppliers, including sole- and single-sourced suppliers, may have heightened continuity risks. we are actively engaged in activities to seek to mitigate the impact of any supply chain disruptions on our operations.
global shortages in important components have resulted in, and will continue to cause, inflationary cost pressure in our supply chain. to date, these supply chain challenges have not materially impacted our results of operations or ability to deliver products and services to our customers. however, supply constraints with certain materials, which may be unavoidable, could delay the timing of finished product deliveries, which could result in deferred or canceled procedures. additionally, if inflationary pressures in component costs persist, we may not be able to quickly or easily adjust pricing, reduce costs, or implement countermeasures. also, there is continued uncertainty surrounding the impact of any monetary policy changes taken by the u.s. federal reserve and other central banks to address the structural risks associated with inflation.
fluctuations in labor availability globally, including labor shortages and staff burnout and attrition, could also impact our ability to hire and retain personnel critical to our manufacturing, logistics, and commercial operations. we are also highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. the loss of critical members of our team, or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, could significantly harm our operations, business, and ability to compete.
a number of hospitals continue to experience challenges with staffing and cost pressures that could affect their ability to provide patient care; however, the staffing challenges have shown signs of improvement during the second half of 2023, relative to the first half of 2023 and to the prior year. additionally, hospitals are facing significant financial pressure as supply chain constraints and inflation drive up operating costs, higher interest rates make access to credit more expensive, unrealized losses decrease available cash reserves, and fiscal stimulus programs enacted during the covid-19 pandemic wind down. hospitals may also be adversely affected by the liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry that could result in delayed access or loss of access to uninsured deposits or loss of their ability to draw on existing credit facilities involving a troubled or failed financial institution. as a consequence of the financial pressures and decreased profitability, some hospitals have indicated that they are lowering their capital investment plans and tightening their operational budgets. we believe that these factors have contributed to a softening in our u.s. capital pipeline, and we expect that demand for capital, particularly in the u.s., will continue to be impacted while macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. in addition, as overall competition for medical technologies, including robotic-assisted devices and treatment options, progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and pricing pressures. any or all of these factors could negatively impact the number of da table of contents vinci procedures performed or the number of system placements and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations resulting in the failure to achieve our anticipated financial results.
we maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major u.s. and multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits exceed insured limits. market conditions could impact the viability of these institutions. to date, these market conditions and liquidity concerns have not impacted our results of operations. however, in the event of the failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. any inability to access or delay in accessing these funds could adversely affect our business and financial position.
covid-19 pandemic in 2021, resurgences of the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (covid-19) affected da vinci procedure volumes at various times throughout the year in most of the markets that we operate in. after each resurgence, as covid-19 cases and hospitalizations subsided, we saw procedure volumes recover. in the u.s., the impact of high covid-related hospitalization rates on procedure volumes was exacerbated by staffing shortages. although hospitals were better equipped to handle covid patients as compared to the outset of the pandemic, covid-19 resurgences challenged hospital resources and negatively impacted da vinci procedure volumes. in addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions had a negative impact on da vinci procedure volumes. volumes associated with benign procedures were generally impacted to a higher degree when covid-19 cases and hospitalizations increased, reflecting the deferability of certain elective surgeries.
in early 2022, a resurgence of covid-19 resulted in a significant increase in infections and hospitalization rates in the u.s. and certain countries in europe, which, in turn, negatively impacted procedure volumes in january and february. as infections and hospitalizations started to decrease in february in the u.s. and europe, we saw a recovery of procedure volumes. in march and during the second quarter of 2022, we also saw a resurgence in covid-19 cases and increased hospitalizations and government interventions impacting parts of asia, particularly china, which negatively impacted procedure volumes. during the third quarter of 2022, we did not experience significant disruptions from covid-19. in the fourth quarter of 2022, we saw a resurgence in covid-19 cases in china, which had a significant negative impact on our procedure volumes in the region.
in 2023, covid-19 resurgences in china continued to negatively impact our procedure volumes in january. however, in february and march, as infections and hospitalization started to decrease, we saw a recovery of procedure volumes. during the remainder of 2023, we did not experience significant disruptions from covid-19.
we expect the depth and extent to which covid-19 impacts individual markets to vary based on the availability of vaccinations, personal protective equipment, intensive care units and operating rooms, and medical staff, as well as other government interventions. additionally, covid-19 has, and may continue to, contribute to hospital staffing shortages, which impacts hospitals' ability to provide patient care and, in some cases, results in the deferral of elective surgeries. when covid-19 infection rates have spiked in a particular region in the past, procedure volumes were often negatively impacted and the diagnoses of new conditions and their related treatments were sometimes deferred. while we believe that there has been a backlog of patients that remains to be treated, and that such a backlog has positively contributed to 2023 procedure volumes, it is difficult to determine if and when any remaining backlog of patients will ultimately seek diagnosis and treatment and whether they will be treated through surgery.
business model overview we generate revenue from the placement of da vinci surgical systems, in sales or sales-type lease arrangements where revenue is recognized up-front or in fixed-payment or usage-based operating lease arrangements where revenue is recognized over time. we earn recurring revenue from the sales of instruments, accessories, and services, as well as revenue from operating leases. the da vinci surgical system generally sells for between $0.7 million and $2.5 million, depending on the model, configuration, and geography, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers when purchased. our instruments and accessories have limited lives and will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery, at which point they need to be replaced. we generally earn between $700 and $3,600 of instruments and accessories revenue per surgical procedure performed, depending on the type and complexity of the specific procedures performed and the number and type of instruments used. we typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold or leased at an annual fee between $80,000 and $200,000, depending on the configuration of the underlying system and the composition of the services offered under the contract. our system sale arrangements generally include a five-year period of service, with the first year of service provided for free. these service contracts have generally been renewed at the end of the initial contractual service periods.
we generate revenue from our ion endoluminal system in a business model consistent with the da vinci surgical system model described above. we generate revenue from the placement of ion systems, in sales or sales-type lease arrangements where revenue is recognized up-front or in fixed-payment or usage-based operating lease arrangements where revenue is table of contents recognized over time. we earn recurring revenue from the sales of instruments, accessories, and services, as well as revenue from operating leases. the ion system generally sells for between $500,000 and $650,000. our instruments and accessories have limited lives and will either expire or wear out as they are used in procedures, at which point they need to be replaced. we typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold or leased at an annual fee between $55,000 and $65,000.
additionally, as part of our ecosystem of products and services, we provide a portfolio of learning offerings and digital solutions. we do not currently generate material revenue from these offerings.
recurring revenue recurring revenue consists of instruments and accessories revenue, service revenue, and operating lease revenue. recurring revenue increased to $5.94 billion, or 83% of total revenue in 2023, compared to $4.92 billion, or 79% of total revenue in 2022, and $4.29 billion, or 75% of total revenue in 2021.
instruments and accessories revenue has grown at a faster rate than systems revenue over time. instruments and accessories revenue increased to $4.28 billion in 2023, compared to $3.52 billion in 2022 and $3.10 billion in 2021. the increase in instruments and accessories revenue largely reflects continued procedure adoption.
service revenue was $1.17 billion in 2023, compared to $1.02 billion in 2022 and $0.92 billion in 2021. the increase in service revenue was primarily driven by the growth of the base of installed da vinci surgical systems producing service revenue. the installed base of da vinci surgical systems grew 14% to approximately 8,606 as of december 31, 2023; 12% to approximately 7,544 as of december 31, 2022; and 12% to approximately 6,730 as of december 31, 2021.
we use the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems as metrics for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. management believes that the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance, as management believes that the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems are an indicator of the rate of adoption of our robotic-assisted medical procedures as well as an indicator of future recurring revenue. management believes that both it and investors benefit from referring to the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems also facilitate management's internal comparisons of our historical performance. we believe that the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems are useful to investors as metrics because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of our business. the vast majority of installed systems are connected via the internet. system logs can also be accessed by field engineers for systems that are not connected to the internet. we utilize this information as well as other information from agreements and discussions with our customers that involve estimates and judgments, which are, by their nature, subject to substantial uncertainties and assumptions. estimates and judgments for determining the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems may be impacted over time by various factors, including system internet connectivity, hospital and distributor reporting behavior, and inherent complexities in new agreements. such estimates and judgments are also susceptible to technical errors. in addition, the relationship between the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems and our revenues may fluctuate from period to period, and growth in the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems may not correspond to an increase in revenue. the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, revenue or other financial information prepared and presented in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
intuitive system leasing since 2013, we have entered into sales-type and fixed-payment operating lease arrangements directly with certain qualified customers as a way to offer customers flexibility in how they acquire systems and expand their robotic-assisted programs while leveraging our balance sheet. these leases generally have commercially competitive terms as compared to other third-party entities that offer equipment leasing. we have also entered into usage-based operating lease arrangements with qualified customers that have committed da vinci programs where we charge for the system and service as the systems are utilized. we believe that these alternative financing structures have been effective and well-received, and we are willing to expand the proportion of these structures based on customer demand. we include systems placed under fixed-payment and usage-based operating lease arrangements, as well as sales-type lease arrangements, in our system placement and installed base disclosures. we exclude operating lease-related revenue, including usage-based revenue, and ion system revenue from our da vinci surgical system average selling price ("asp") computations.

revenue from fixed-payment operating lease arrangements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and revenue from usage-based operating lease arrangements is recognized as the systems are used. we generally set fixed-payment and usage-based operating lease arrangements' pricing at a modest premium relative to purchased systems reflecting the time value of money and, in the case of usage-based operating lease arrangements, the risk that system utilization may fall short of anticipated levels. variable lease revenue recognized from usage-based operating lease arrangements has been included in our operating lease metrics herein. operating lease revenue has grown at a faster rate than overall systems revenue and was $501 million, $377 million, and $277 million for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, of which $217 million, $133 million, and $78 million, respectively, was variable lease revenue related to our usage-based operating lease arrangements. as revenue for fixed-payment and usage-based operating lease arrangements is recognized over time, total systems revenue growth is reduced in a period when the number of operating lease placements increases as a proportion of total system placements. generally, lease transactions generate similar gross margins as our sale transactions.

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our lease financing arrangements may increase if our customers are adversely affected by economic pressures or uncertainty, changes in healthcare laws, coverage and reimbursement, or other customer-specific factors. as a result of these macroeconomic factors impacting our customers, we may be exposed to defaults under our lease financing arrangements. moreover, usage-based operating lease arrangements generally contain no minimum payments; therefore, customers may exit such arrangements without paying a financial penalty to us.
table of contents for some operating lease arrangements, our customers are provided with the right to purchase the leased system at certain points during and/or at the end of the lease term. revenue generated from customer purchases of systems under operating lease arrangements ("lease buyouts") was $74 million, $72 million, and $96 million for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. we expect that revenue recognized from customer exercises of buyout options will fluctuate based on the timing of when, and if, customers choose to exercise their buyout options.
systems revenue system placements are driven by procedure growth in most markets. in some markets, system placements are constrained by regulation. in geographies where da vinci procedure adoption is in an early stage or system placements are constrained by regulation, system sales will precede procedure growth. system placements also vary due to seasonality largely aligned with hospital budgeting cycles. on an annual basis, we typically place a higher proportion of systems in the fourth quarter and a lower proportion in the first quarter as customer budgets are reset. systems revenue is also affected by the proportion of system placements under operating lease arrangements, recurring fixed-payment and usage-based operating lease revenue, lease buyouts, product mix, asps, trade-in activities, customer mix, and specified-price trade-in rights. we generally do not provide specified-price trade-in rights or upgrade rights at the time of a system purchase. however, we expect that the number of arrangements that may contain these specified-price trade-in rights will increase when we launch our fifth-generation multi-port platform, da vinci 5. systems revenue remained flat at $1.68 billion in 2023. systems revenue declined 1% to $1.68 billion in 2022. systems revenue grew 44% to $1.69 billion in 2021.
procedure mix / products our da vinci surgical systems are generally used for soft tissue surgery for areas of the body between the pelvis and the neck, primarily in general, gynecologic, urologic, cardiothoracic, and head and neck surgeries. within these categories, procedures range in complexity from cancer and other highly complex procedures to less complex procedures for benign conditions. cancer and other highly complex procedures tend to be reimbursed at higher rates than less complex procedures for benign conditions. thus, hospitals are more sensitive to the costs associated with treating less complex, benign conditions. our strategy is to provide hospitals with attractive clinical and economical solutions across the spectrum of procedure complexity. our fully featured da vinci xi surgical system with advanced instruments (including da vinci energy and endowrist and sureform stapler products) and our integrated table motion product targets the more complex procedure segment. our da vinci x surgical system is targeted toward price-sensitive markets and procedures. our da vinci sp surgical system complements the da vinci xi and x surgical systems by enabling surgeons to access narrow workspaces.
procedure seasonality more than half of the da vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions, most notably hernia repairs, hysterectomies, and cholecystectomies. these benign procedures and other short-term elective procedures tend to be more seasonal than cancer operations and surgeries for other life-threatening conditions. seasonality in the u.s. for procedures for benign conditions typically results in higher fourth quarter procedure volume when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower first quarter procedure volume when deductibles are reset. seasonality outside of the u.s. varies and is more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods, which have lower procedure volume. as a result of the factors outlined in the covid-19 pandemic section above, including past and potentially future recommendations of authorities to defer elective procedures, historical procedure patterns may be disrupted.
distribution channels we provide our products through direct sales organizations in the u.s., europe (excluding italy, spain, portugal, greece, and eastern european countries), china (through our intuitive-fosun pharma joint venture), japan, south korea, india, taiwan, and canada. in the remainder of our ous markets, we provide our products through distributors.
regulatory activities overview our products must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international standards that govern the product safety, efficacy, advertising, labeling, safety reporting design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use, and disposal of our products. examples of such standards include electrical safety standards, such as those of the international electrotechnical commission, and composition standards, such as the reduction of hazardous substances and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directives in the eu. failure to meet these standards could limit our ability to market our products in those regions that require compliance with such standards.
our products and operations are also subject to increasingly stringent medical device, privacy, and other regulations by regional, federal, state, and local authorities. after a device is placed on the market, numerous fda and comparable foreign regulatory requirements continue to apply. these requirements include establishment registration and device listing with the table of contents fda or other foreign regulatory authorities and compliance with medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the fda or other foreign regulatory authorities if their device caused or contributed, or may have caused or contributed, to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
we anticipate that timelines for the introduction of new products and/or indications may be extended relative to past experience as a result of these regulations. for example, we have seen elongated regulatory approval timelines in the u.s. and europe.
clearances, approvals, and certifications we have generally obtained the regulatory clearances, approvals, and certifications required to market our products associated with our da vinci multi-port surgical systems (s, si, xi, and x systems) for our targeted surgical specialties within the u.s., south korea, japan, and the european markets in which we operate. since 2021, we have obtained regulatory clearances, approvals, and certifications for the following products:

refer to the descriptions of our new products that received regulatory clearances, approvals, or certifications in 2023, 2022, and 2021 in the recent product introductions section below.
in june 2023, the china national health commission published the 14th five-year plan quota for major medical equipment to be sold in china on its official website. under the 2023 quota, the government will allow for the sale of 559 new surgical robots into china, which could include da vinci surgical systems as well as surgical systems introduced by others. as of december 31, 2023, including systems that were sold in prior quarters, we have placed 76 da vinci surgical systems under the 2023 quota. future sales of da vinci surgical systems under this and any previously published open quotas are uncertain, as they are open to other medical device companies that have introduced robotic-assisted surgical systems and are dependent on hospitals completing a tender process and receiving associated approvals. also, our ability to track the number of systems that could be sold under these quotas in the future will be limited by provincial and national agencies making such information publicly available.
since 2022, several provinces, including the hunan provincial healthcare security administration, have implemented significant limits on what hospitals can charge patients for surgeries using robotic surgical technology, including soft tissue surgery and orthopedics. these limits have significantly impacted the number of procedures performed and have impacted our instruments and accessories revenue in those provinces. as of the date of this report, these limits have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, as only a small portion of our installed base in china is currently located in the impacted provinces. companies providing robotic surgical technology, including our joint venture in china, have been meeting with chinese government healthcare agencies to discuss these developments and to provide feedback. we cannot assure you that additional provincial or national healthcare agencies and administrations will not impose similar limits, and we expect to continue to face increased pricing pressure, both of which could further impact the number of procedures performed and our instruments and accessories revenue in china.
the japanese ministry of health, labor, and welfare considers reimbursement for procedures in april of even-numbered years. the process for obtaining reimbursement requires japanese university hospitals and surgical societies, with our support, to seek reimbursement. there are multiple pathways to obtain reimbursement for procedures, including those that require in-country clinical and economic data. in april 2012 and april 2016, the mhlw granted reimbursement status for prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy, respectively. most prostatectomies and partial nephrectomies were open procedures prior to da vinci reimbursement. da vinci procedure reimbursement for prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy procedures are higher than open and conventional laparoscopic procedure reimbursements. an additional 12 da vinci procedures were granted reimbursement in april, 2018, including gastrectomy, low anterior resection, lobectomy, and hysterectomy, for both malignant and benign conditions, and an additional seven da vinci procedures were granted reimbursement in april, 2020. an additional eight da vinci procedures were granted reimbursement in april, 2022, including colon resection. in addition, we received higher reimbursement for da vinci gastrectomy procedures, as compared to open and conventional laparoscopic procedure reimbursements. the additional reimbursed procedures have varying levels of conventional laparoscopic penetration and will generally be reimbursed at rates equal to the conventional laparoscopic procedures. given the reimbursement level and laparoscopic penetration for these additional procedures, there can be no assurance that the adoption pace for these procedures will be similar to prostatectomy or partial nephrectomy, given their higher reimbursement, or any other da vinci procedure.
recalls and corrections medical device companies have regulatory obligations to correct or remove medical devices in the field that could pose a risk to health. the definition of "recalls and corrections" is expansive and includes repair, replacement, inspections, relabeling, and issuance of new or additional instructions for use or reinforcement of existing instructions for use and training when such actions are taken for specific reasons of safety or compliance. these field actions require stringent documentation, reporting, and monitoring worldwide. there are other actions that a medical device manufacturer may take in the field without reporting including, but not limited to, routine servicing and stock rotations.
as we determine whether a field action is reportable in any regulatory jurisdiction, we prepare and submit notifications to the appropriate regulatory agency for the particular jurisdiction. regulators can require the expansion, reclassification, or change in scope and language of the field action. in general, upon submitting required notifications to regulators regarding a field action that is a recall or correction, we will notify customers regarding the field action, provide any additional table of contents documentation required in their national language, and arrange, as required, the return or replacement of the affected product or a field service visit to perform the correction.
field actions, as well as certain outcomes from regulatory activities, can result in adverse effects on our business, including damage to our reputation, delays by customers of purchase decisions, reduction or stoppage of the use of installed systems, and reduced revenue as well as increased expenses.
procedures we model patient value as equal to procedure efficacy / invasiveness. in this equation, procedure efficacy is defined as a measure of the success of the procedure in resolving the underlying disease, and invasiveness is defined as a measure of patient pain and disruption of regular activities. when the patient value of a robotic-assisted procedure is greater than that of alternative treatment options, patients may benefit from seeking out surgeons or physicians and hospitals that offer robotic-assisted medical procedures, which could potentially result in a local market share shift. adoption of robotic-assisted procedures occurs by procedure and by market and is driven by the relative patient value and total treatment costs of robotic-assisted procedures as compared to alternative treatment options for the same disease state or condition.
we use the number and type of procedures as metrics for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. management believes that the number and type of procedures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance, as management believes procedure volume is an indicator of the rate of adoption of our robotic-assisted medical procedures as well as an indicator of future revenue (including revenue from usage-based operating lease arrangements). management believes that both it and investors benefit from referring to the number and type of procedures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. the number and type of procedures also facilitate management's internal comparisons of our historical performance. we believe that the number and type of procedures are useful to investors as metrics, because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of our business. the vast majority of our installed systems are connected via the internet. system logs can also be accessed by field engineers for systems that are not connected to the internet. we utilize certain methods that rely on information collected from the installed systems for determining the number and type of procedures performed that involve estimates and judgments, which are, by their nature, subject to substantial uncertainties and assumptions. estimates and judgments for determining the number and type of procedures may be impacted over time by various factors, including changes in treatment modalities, hospital and distributor reporting behavior, and system internet connectivity. such estimates and judgments are also susceptible to algorithmic or other technical errors. in addition, the relationship between the number and type of procedures and our revenues may fluctuate from period to period, and procedure volume growth may not correspond to an increase in revenue. the number and type of procedures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, revenue or other financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap.
our systems and instruments are regulated independently in various countries and regions of the world. the discussion of indications for use and representative or target procedures is intended solely to provide an understanding of the market for our products and is not intended to promote for sale or use any intuitive product outside of its licensed or cleared labeling and indications for use.
da vinci procedures the adoption of robotic-assisted surgery using the da vinci surgical system has the potential to grow for those procedures that offer greater patient value than to non-da vinci alternatives and competitive total economics for healthcare providers. our da vinci surgical systems are used primarily in general, urologic, gynecologic, cardiothoracic, and head and neck surgeries. we focus our organization and investments on developing, marketing, and training products and services for procedures in which da vinci can bring patient value relative to alternative treatment options and/or economic benefit to healthcare providers. target procedures in general surgery include hernia repair (both ventral and inguinal), colorectal, cholecystectomy, and bariatric procedures. target procedures in urology include prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy. target procedures in gynecology include hysterectomy for both cancer and benign conditions and sacrocolpopexy. in cardiothoracic surgery, target procedures include lung resection. in head and neck surgery, target procedures include transoral surgery. not all indications, procedures, or products described may be available in a given country or region or on all generations of da vinci surgical systems. surgeons and their patients need to consult the product labeling in their specific country and for each product in order to determine the cleared uses, as well as important limitations, restrictions, or contraindications.
in 2023, approximately 2,286,000 surgical procedures were performed with da vinci surgical systems, compared to approximately 1,875,000 and 1,594,000 surgical procedures performed with da vinci surgical systems in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase in our overall procedure volume in 2023 was largely attributable to growth in u.s. general surgery, ous urologic surgery, ous general surgery (particularly cancer), and u.s. gynecologic surgery procedures. the overall table of contents procedure volumes in the comparative 2022 and 2021 years reflect the disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic, as noted in the covid-19 pandemic section above.
u.s. da vinci procedures overall u.s. procedure volume with da vinci surgical systems grew to approximately 1,532,000 in 2023, compared to approximately 1,282,000 in 2022 and approximately 1,109,000 in 2021. general surgery was our largest and fastest growing u.s. specialty in 2023 with procedure volume that grew to approximately 896,000 in 2023, compared to approximately 720,000 in 2022 and approximately 588,000 in 2021. gynecology was our second largest u.s. surgical specialty in 2023 with procedure volume that grew to approximately 390,000 in 2023, compared to approximately 341,000 in 2022 and approximately 316,000 in 2021. urology was our third largest u.s. surgical specialty in 2023 with procedure volume that grew to approximately 173,000 in 2023, compared to approximately 162,000 in 2022 and approximately 153,000 in 2021.
ous da vinci procedures overall ous procedure volume with da vinci surgical systems grew to approximately 754,000 in 2023, compared to approximately 593,000 in 2022 and approximately 485,000 in 2021. urology was our largest ous specialty in 2023 with procedure volume that grew to approximately 381,000 in 2023, compared to approximately 316,000 in 2022 and approximately 264,000 in 2021. general surgery was our second largest and fastest growing ous specialty in 2023 with procedure volume that grew to approximately 188,000 in 2023, compared to approximately 133,000 in 2022 and approximately 101,000 in 2021. gynecology was our third largest ous specialty in 2023 with procedure volume that grew to approximately 110,000 in 2023, compared to approximately 86,000 in 2022 and approximately 70,000 in 2021.
ion procedures the adoption of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy using the ion endoluminal system has the potential to grow if it can offer greater patient value than non-ion alternatives and competitive total economics for healthcare providers.
in 2023, approximately 54,000 biopsy procedures were performed with ion systems, compared to approximately 23,500 in 2022 and approximately 7,400 in 2021. the increase in our overall procedure volume in 2023 reflects a larger installed base of approximately 534 systems, an increase of 66% compared to the installed base of approximately 321 systems as of 2022. currently, the vast majority of ion biopsy procedures are performed in the u.s.
recent business events and trends procedures overall. total da vinci procedures performed by our customers grew approximately 22% for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to approximately 18% for the year ended december 31, 2022. the growth in the comparative 2022 procedure results partially reflected disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic in both the 2022 and comparative 2021 procedure results, as noted in the covid-19 pandemic section above. the 2023 procedure growth was largely attributable to growth in u.s. general surgery, ous urologic surgery, ous general surgery (particularly cancer), and u.s. gynecologic surgery procedures. delays in both the diagnosis and treatments of diseases reflecting disruptions caused by covid-19 have previously, and may continue to, adversely impact procedure volumes in periods with disruption. such delays may also create treatment backlogs that could have a beneficial impact on future period procedure volumes.
u.s. procedures. u.s. da vinci procedures grew approximately 19% for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to approximately 16% for the year ended december 31, 2022. the 2022 procedure results (and comparative 2021 procedures results) reflected disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic, as noted in the covid-19 pandemic section above. the 2023 u.s. procedure growth was largely attributable to growth in general surgery procedures, most notably cholecystectomy, hernia repair, and colorectal procedures. growth in bariatric procedures decelerated in 2023. growth in the more mature gynecologic procedure category accelerated in 2023, while growth in the more mature urologic procedure category was more moderate.
u.s. general surgery.  general surgery procedures in the u.s. grew to approximately 896,000 in 2023, compared to approximately 720,000 in 2022 and approximately 588,000 in 2021. cholecystectomy, inguinal and ventral hernia repair, and colorectal procedures contributed the most incremental procedures in 2023, while inguinal and ventral hernia repair, cholecystectomy, and bariatric procedures contributed the most incremental procedures in 2022 and 2021.
given the already very high level of laparoscopic techniques used in cholecystectomy, it is unclear to what extent robotic-assisted surgery using da vinci may continue to be adopted.
we believe that growth in hernia repair using da vinci reflects improved clinical outcomes within certain patient populations, as well as potential cost benefits relative to certain alternative treatments. we believe that hernia repair procedures represent a significant opportunity with the potential to drive growth in future periods. however, given the differences in surgical complexity associated with the treatment of various hernia patient populations and varying surgeon opinions regarding table of contents optimal surgical technique, it is difficult to estimate the timing of and to what extent hernia repair procedure volume will grow in the future. we expect a large portion of hernia repairs will continue to be performed via different modalities of surgery.
the adoption of da vinci for colorectal procedures, which includes several underlying procedures, such as low anterior resections for rectal cancers and certain colon procedures for benign and cancerous conditions, has been ongoing for several years and is supported by certain technologies, such as the endowrist and sureform staplers, energy devices, and integrated table motion.
bariatric procedures have been an increased area of focus and may have benefited from certain patients prioritizing weight loss, as obesity is a significant covid-19 risk factor. in addition, our sureform 60mm stapler provides surgeons with a more optimized robotic tool set for bariatric procedures using da vinci. while bariatric procedures have grown significantly over the last three years, the pace of this growth has slowed during 2023. it is unclear whether the slowing growth is a temporary pause as patients evaluate new drug therapies or if growth in u.s. bariatric procedures will continue to slow in future periods. the diagnosis and treatment pathways for bariatric patients are long, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to see significant growth in bariatric procedures in future periods.
u.s. gynecology.  gynecology procedures in the u.s. grew to approximately 390,000 in 2023, compared to approximately 341,000 in 2022 and approximately 316,000 in 2021. benign hysterectomy procedures contributed the most incremental procedures in 2023, 2022, and 2021. the growth in benign hysterectomy procedures has been driven largely by new surgeon training.
ous procedures. ous da vinci procedures grew approximately 27% for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to approximately 22% for the year ended december 31, 2022. the 2022 procedure results (and comparative 2021 procedures results) reflected disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic, as noted in the covid-19 pandemic section above. the 2023 ous procedure growth was driven by continued growth in urologic procedures, including prostatectomies and partial nephrectomies, and earlier stage growth in general surgery (particularly colorectal) and gynecologic procedures. the 2023 ous procedure growth rate reflects continued da vinci adoption in european and asian markets. we saw strong procedure growth in china, japan, germany, and the uk during 2023. in china, the strong procedure growth rate was partially attributable to the disruption caused by covid-19 in the comparative 2022 procedure results. we believe that growth in these global markets is being driven by increased acceptance among surgeons and health systems, supported by expanded global evidence validating the clinical and economic value of da vinci procedures as well as increased surgeon training.
ous urology. ous urology procedures have been a strong contributor to our overall procedure growth. ous urology procedures grew to approximately 381,000 in 2023, compared to approximately 316,000 in 2022 and approximately 264,000 in 2021. in the u.s., da vinci is the standard of care for the surgical treatment of prostate cancer, and we believe that the growth is largely aligned with surgical volumes of prostate cancer. outside of the u.s., prostatectomy is at varying states of adoption in different areas of the world but is the largest overall da vinci procedure. in 2023, we saw more moderate growth in ous prostatectomy procedures compared to higher growth in 2022, as we are further up the adoption curve.
kidney cancer procedures have also been a strong contributor to our recent global urology procedure growth. clinical publications have demonstrated that the use of a da vinci system increases the likelihood that a patient will receive nephron sparing surgery through a partial nephrectomy, which is typically the surgical society guideline recommended therapy.
ous general surgery.  ous general surgery procedures grew to approximately 188,000 in 2023, compared to approximately 133,000 in 2022 and approximately 101,000 in 2021. colorectal procedures contributed the most incremental procedures in 2023, 2022, and 2021, aided by improved clinical outcomes relative to open and laparoscopic techniques within certain patient populations, along with enabling technologies, such as endowrist and sureform staplers, energy devices, and integrated table motion.
system demand we placed 1,370 da vinci surgical systems in 2023, compared to 1,264 systems in 2022. the increase in system placements reflects an increase in demand for additional capacity by our customers as a result of procedure growth. this increase was partially offset by the impacts of a smaller number of third generation da vinci systems available for trade-in and the macroeconomic challenges impacting our customers. we continue to see our customers challenged by staffing shortages, inflation, debt servicing costs, and other financial pressures, particularly in the u.s. as a result, we expect our customers to continue to be cautious in their overall capital spending. in addition, in july 2023, the chinese government launched a one-year anti-corruption campaign targeting the healthcare sector. as a result of this anti-corruption campaign, the medical institutions have heightened their scrutiny with respect to initiating tenders. therefore, some tenders were cancelled or delayed without a timeline. in 2023, the effect of this anti-corruption campaign contributed to fewer systems being placed in china. currently, the extent of the impact of this anti-corruption campaign on our business remains uncertain.
table of contents we expect that future placements of da vinci surgical systems will be impacted by a number of factors: supply chain risks; economic and geopolitical factors; inflationary pressures; high interest rates; hospital staffing shortages; procedure growth rates; evolving system utilization and point-of-care dynamics; capital replacement trends, including a declining number of older generation systems available for trade-in transactions; additional reimbursements in various global markets, such as in japan; the timing around governmental tenders and authorizations, as well as governmental actions impacting the tender process, such as the anti-corruption campaign in china; the impact of covid-19, as noted in the covid-19 pandemic section above; the hospital response to the evolving healthcare environment; the timing of when we receive regulatory clearance in our other ous markets for our da vinci xi, x, and sp surgical systems and related instruments; and the market response. market acceptance of our da vinci sp surgical system and the nature and timing of additional da vinci sp regulatory indications may also impact future system placements.
demand may also be impacted by competition, including from companies that have introduced products in the field of robotic-assisted medical procedures or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field including, but not limited to, the following companies: asensus surgical, inc.; beijing surgerii robotics company limited; cmr surgical ltd.; johnson & johnson; medicaroid corporation; medtronic plc; meerecompany inc.; noah medical; shandong weigao group medical polymer company ltd.; shanghai microport medbot (group) co., ltd.; and shenzhen edge medical co., ltd.
many of the above factors will also impact future demand for our ion endoluminal system, as we extend our commercial offering into diagnostics, along with additional factors associated with a new product introduction, including, but not limited to, our ability to optimize manufacturing and our supply chain, competition, clinical data to demonstrate value, and market acceptance.
recent product introductions e-200 generator. in november 2022, we obtained fda clearance for the e-200 generator. in july 2023, we received regulatory clearance for our e-200 generator in japan and south korea. the e-200 generator is an advanced electrosurgical generator designed to provide high-frequency energy for cutting, coagulation, and vessel sealing of tissues. the e-200 generator is compatible with the da vinci xi and x surgical systems and can also function as a standalone electrosurgical generator. when connected to a da vinci system, the e-200 delivers high-frequency energy to da vinci instruments, with control and status messages communicated through an ethernet cable. the e-200 generator is also compatible with third-party handheld monopolar and bipolar instruments, as well as fingerswitch-equipped instruments and intuitive-provided auxiliary footswitches. the e-200 generator includes the same advanced energy capability as the e-100 generator and supports the same vessel sealing instruments.
sureform 30 curved-tip stapler and reloads. in december 2021, we obtained initial fda clearance for our 8 mm sureform 30 curved-tip stapler and reloads (gray, white, and blue) for use in general, thoracic, gynecologic, urologic, and pediatric surgery. we designed this instrument to help surgeons better visualize and reach anatomy through a combination of the 8 mm diameter instrument shaft and jaws, 120-degree cone of wristed articulation, and the curved tip. as it fits through the 8 mm da vinci surgical system instrument cannula, the stapler allows different angles for surgeons to approach patient anatomy. consistent with our other sureform staplers, the 8 mm sureform 30 curved-tip stapler integrates smartfire technology, which makes automatic adjustments to the firing process as staples are formed and the transection is made. the technology makes more than 1,000 measurements per second, helping achieve a consistent staple line. we completed initial evaluations of the 8 mm sureform 30 stapler with certain customers in the u.s. in 2022. after the initial feedback, we are completing design changes and are targeting another submission in 2024. in october 2022, we received regulatory clearance in japan to market our 8 mm sureform 30 curved-tip and straight-tip stapler instruments and reloads for use in general, thoracic (except for cardiac), gynecologic, and urologic surgery.
intuitive ventures in 2020, we launched intuitive ventures fund i, an inaugural $100 million fund focused on investment opportunities in companies that share intuitive's commitment to advancing positive outcomes in healthcare. as of december 31, 2023, we have invested $50 million of the $100 million.
in late 2023, we launched intuitive ventures fund ii, a $150 million fund focused on investment opportunities in companies reimagining the future of minimally invasive care.

table of contents product revenue product revenue increased by 15% to $5.96 billion for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to $5.20 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022. product revenue for the year ended december 31, 2022, increased by 8% compared to $4.79 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021.
instruments and accessories revenue increased by 22% to $4.28 billion for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to $3.52 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase in instruments and accessories revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023, was primarily driven by approximately 22% higher da vinci procedure volume and higher pricing, partially offset by customer buying patterns. the 2023 u.s. da vinci procedure growth was approximately 19%, driven by strong growth in general surgery procedures, most notably cholecystectomy, hernia repair, and colorectal procedures. growth in bariatric procedures decelerated in 2023. growth in the more mature gynecologic procedure category accelerated in 2023, while growth in the more mature urologic procedure category was more moderate. the 2023 ous da vinci procedure growth was approximately 27%, driven by continued growth in urologic procedures, including prostatectomies and partial nephrectomies, and earlier stage growth in general surgery (particularly colorectal) and gynecologic procedures. geographically, the 2023 ous da vinci procedure growth was driven by procedure expansion in a number of markets with particular strength in china, japan, germany, and the uk. in china, the strong procedure growth rate was partially attributable to the disruption caused by covid-19 in the comparative 2022 procedure results.
systems revenue remained flat at $1.68 billion for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to $1.68 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022. the flat system revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023, was primarily driven by higher operating lease revenue, offset by lower sales-type lease revenue, lower asps, and a higher proportion of da vinci system placements under operating leases (partially offset by more systems placements).
during 2023, 1,370 da vinci surgical systems were placed compared to 1,264 systems during 2022. by geography, 666 systems were placed in the u.s., 308 in europe, 305 in asia, and 91 in other markets during 2023, compared to 692 systems placed in the u.s., 280 in europe, 244 in asia, and 48 in other markets during 2022. the increase in system placements was primarily driven by the demand for additional capacity by our customers due to the procedure growth, partially offset by a smaller number of third generation da vinci systems available for trade-in, the macroeconomic challenges impacting our u.s. customers, and the effect of the anti-corruption campaign in china. as of december 31, 2023, we had a da vinci surgical system installed base of approximately 8,606 systems, compared to an installed base of approximately 7,544 systems as of december 31, 2022. the incremental system installed base reflects continued procedure growth and further customer validation that robotic-assisted surgery addresses their quadruple aim objectives.

operating lease revenue, including the contribution from ion systems, was $501 million for the year ended december 31, 2023, of which $217 million was variable lease revenue relating to usage-based arrangements, compared to $377 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, of which $133 million was variable lease revenue relating to usage-based arrangements. revenue from lease buyouts was $74.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to $72.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2022. we expect revenue from lease buyouts to fluctuate period to period depending on the timing of when, and if, customers choose to exercise buyout options embedded in their leases.
table of contents the da vinci surgical system asp, excluding systems placed under fixed-payment or usage-based operating lease arrangements and ion systems, was approximately $1.42 million for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to approximately $1.49 million for the year ended december 31, 2022. the lower asp for the year ended december 31, 2023, was largely driven by higher pricing discounts, unfavorable product mix, unfavorable geographic mix, and foreign currency impacts, partially offset by fewer trade-ins. asp fluctuates from period to period based on geographic and product mix, product pricing, systems placed involving trade-ins, and changes in foreign exchange rates.
during 2023, 213 ion systems were placed compared to 192 systems during 2022. the increase in system placements was primarily driven by the demand for additional capacity by our customers due to the procedure growth. as of december 31, 2023, we had an ion system installed base of approximately 534 systems, compared to an installed base of approximately 321 systems as of december 31, 2022.

service revenue service revenue increased by 14% to $1.17 billion for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to $1.02 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase in service revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023, was primarily driven by a larger installed base of systems producing service revenue.
gross profit product gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased by 12% to $3.91 billion, representing 65.7% of product revenue, compared to $3.50 billion, representing 67.3% of product revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2022. the higher product gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2023, was primarily driven by higher product revenue, partially offset by a lower product gross profit margin. the lower product gross profit margin for the year ended december 31, 2023, was primarily driven by a higher mix of new products, higher costs related to scrap and components, increases in inventory reserves, and lower 2023 da vinci system asps, partially offset by higher pricing for instruments and accessories.
product gross profit for the years ended december 31, 2023, and 2022, included share-based compensation expense of $83.4 million and $67.6 million, respectively, and intangible assets amortization expense of $13.5 million and $17.3 million, respectively service gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased by 17% to $0.82 billion, representing 69.8% of service revenue, compared to $0.70 billion, representing 68.2% of service revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2022. the higher service gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2023, was primarily driven by higher service revenue, reflecting a larger installed base of da vinci surgical systems, and a higher service gross profit margin. the higher service gross profit margin for the year ended december 31, 2023, was primarily driven by favorable impacts from leveraging volume of repairs.
service gross profit for the years ended december 31, 2023, and 2022, included share-based compensation expense of $28.2 million and $23.6 million, respectively, and intangible assets amortization expense of $0.9 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
table of contents selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales and marketing activities, trade show expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees, and general corporate expenses.
selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased by 13% to $1.96 billion, compared to $1.74 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023, was primarily driven by higher headcount, resulting in increased fixed and share-based compensation expense, higher variable compensation, the charitable contribution discussed below, as well as higher travel and training expenses, partially offset by lower litigation charges. in the fourth quarter of 2023, we made a charitable contribution of $40 million to the intuitive foundation, a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to reduce the global burden of disease and suffering through research, education, and philanthropy aimed at better outcomes for patients around the globe.
selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31, 2023, and 2022, included share-based compensation expense of $275 million and $261 million, respectively, and intangible assets amortization expense of $3.3 million and $5.9 million, respectively.
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred. research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, and significant enhancement of our products. our main product development initiatives include multi-port, ion, and sp platform investments and our digital products and services.
research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased by 14% to $999 million, compared to $879 million for the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023, was primarily driven by higher personnel-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, and other project costs incurred to support a broader set of product development initiatives, including future generations of robotics, ion and sp platform investments, and digital investments.
research and development expenses for the years ended december 31, 2023, and 2022, included share-based compensation expense of $212 million and $164 million, respectively, and intangible asset-related charges of $13.5 million and $20.3 million, respectively.
research and development expenses fluctuate with project timing. based upon our broader set of product development initiatives and the stage of the underlying projects, we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future.
interest and other income, net interest and other income, net, for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased by 547% to $192 million, compared to $30 million for the year ended december 31, 2022. interest and other income, net decreased by 57% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $69 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase in interest and other income, net, for the year ended december 31, 2023, was primarily driven by higher interest income earned due to an increase in average interest rates (despite lower average cash and investment balances), lower foreign exchange losses, and lower unrealized losses on investments resulting from strategic arrangements.
we held an equity investment in preferred shares of broncus holding corporation ("broncus"), which was reflected in our consolidated financial statements on a cost basis. in the first quarter of 2021, we recorded an unrealized gain on our investment in broncus of approximately $14 million. in september 2021, broncus completed an initial public offering ("ipo") of common shares on the stock exchange of hong kong. upon completion of the ipo, the preferred shares were converted to common shares in broncus, and we recognized a net gain on this investment in the third quarter of 2021 of approximately $8 million. for the year ended december 31, 2022, we recognized a loss on this investment of approximately $21 million. for the year ended december 31, 2023, we sold our shares in this investment, recognizing an additional nominal loss.
income tax expense income tax expense was $142 million and $262 million for the years ended december 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. our effective tax rate for 2023 was approximately 7.2% compared to 16.3% for 2022.
our effective tax rates for 2023 differed from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the increase in swiss deferred tax assets, as discussed below, the tax benefits associated with employee equity plans, the effect of income earned by certain overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate, the federal research and development credit benefit, and the release of unrecognized tax benefits due to statute expiration in various jurisdictions, partially offset by the u.s. tax on foreign earnings and state income taxes (net of the federal benefit).
table of contents our effective tax rates for 2022 differed from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the tax benefits associated with employee equity plans, the effect of income earned by certain overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate, and the federal research and development credit benefit, partially offset by the u.s. tax on foreign earnings and state income taxes (net of the federal benefit).
our lower effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to the year ended december 31, 2022, was primarily due to the increase in swiss deferred tax assets, as discussed below, and lower u.s. tax on foreign earnings.
our provision for income taxes for 2023 reflected swiss tax benefits of $92.3 million, net of a $67.3 million valuation allowance, related to certain tax assets recorded by our swiss entity. in addition, a one-time net benefit of $67.1 million was recorded from the re-measurement of our swiss deferred tax assets resulting from the swiss cantonal tax rate increase enacted in december 2023 for years after 2024 as well as a swiss cantonal tax rate increase from the discontinuation of our 2017 swiss tax ruling, which was deemed effective as of january 1, 2023.
our provision for income taxes for 2023 and 2022 included excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans of $108 million and $99 million, respectively, which reduced our effective tax rate by 5.5 and 6.1 percentage points, respectively. the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies will fluctuate from period to period based on the price of our stock, the volume of share-based awards settled or vested, and the value assigned to employee equity awards under gaap, which results in increased income tax expense volatility.
on august 16, 2022, the inflation reduction act was enacted in the u.s. and introduced a 15% alternative minimum tax based on the financial statement income of certain large corporations ("camt"), effective january 1, 2023. there is no impact on our provision for income taxes from the camt for the year ended december 31, 2023.
in 2021, the oecd established an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting and agreed on a two-pillar solution ("pillar two") to global taxation, focusing on global profit allocation and a 15% global minimum effective tax rate. on december 15, 2022, the european union member states agreed to implement the oecd's global minimum tax rate of 15%. the oecd issued pillar two model rules and continues to release guidance on these rules. the inclusive framework calls for tax law changes by participating countries to take effect in 2024 and 2025. various countries have enacted or have announced plans to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax. we considered the applicable tax law changes on pillar two implementation in the relevant countries, and there is no impact to our tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2023. we will continue to evaluate the impact of these tax law changes on future reporting periods.
we file federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the u.s. and ous. years before 2016 are considered closed for most significant jurisdictions. certain of our unrecognized tax benefits could change due to activities of various tax authorities, including evolving interpretations of existing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, potential assessment of additional tax, possible settlement of audits, or through normal expiration of various statutes of limitations, which could affect our effective tax rate in the period in which they change. due to the uncertainty related to the timing and potential outcome of audits, we cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible changes in unrecognized tax benefits that may occur in the next 12 months.
we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. the outcome of these audits cannot be predicted with certainty. management regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in joint venture the company's joint venture with fosun pharma was established to research, develop, manufacture, and sell robotic-assisted, catheter-based medical devices. the joint venture is owned 60% by us and 40% by fosun pharma and is located in china. the catheter-based technology will initially target early diagnosis and cost-effective treatment of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world. distribution of catheter-based medical devices in china will be conducted by the joint venture, while distribution outside of china will be conducted by us.
in january 2019, the joint venture acquired certain assets, including distribution rights, customer relationships, and certain personnel, from chindex and its affiliates, a subsidiary of fosun pharma, and began direct operations for da vinci products and services in china. as of december 31, 2023, the companies have contributed $55 million of up to $100 million required by the joint venture agreement. following approval in june 2023 by china's nmpa for a local version of our da vinci xi surgical system, in august 2023, our intuitive-fosun pharma joint venture received a manufacturing license that permits the joint venture to manufacture our da vinci xi surgical system for sale to customers in china.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in joint venture for the year ended december 31, 2023, was $19.3 million, compared to $22.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2022.
table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by our operations and by the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program. cash and cash equivalents plus short- and long-term investments increased by $0.60 billion to $7.34 billion as of december 31, 2023, from $6.74 billion as of december 31, 2022, primarily as a result of cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases, and unrealized gains on interest-bearing debt securities classified as available for sale, partially offset by cash used for capital expenditures and share repurchases. cash and cash equivalents plus short- and long-term investments decreased by $1.88 billion to $6.74 billion as of december 31, 2022, from $8.62 billion as of december 31, 2021, primarily from cash used in share repurchases, capital expenditures, and taxes paid related to net share settlements of equity awards, as well as unrealized losses on interest-bearing debt securities classified as available for sale, offset by cash provided by our operations and proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases.
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products, and other factors. we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to expand procedure adoption and acceptance of our products. we have made substantial investments in our commercial operations, product development activities, facilities, and intellectual property. based on our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided by our operations. we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances, together with income to be derived from our business, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. however, we may experience reduced cash flow from operations as a result of the risk of a recession along with other macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds.
as of december 31, 2023, $521 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments was held by foreign subsidiaries. we intend to repatriate earnings from our swiss subsidiary and our joint venture in hong kong, as needed, since the u.s. and foreign tax implications of such repatriations are not expected to be significant. we will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from the rest of our foreign subsidiaries and do not expect the tax implications of repatriating these earnings to be significant.
see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for discussion on the impact of interest rate risk and market risk on our investment portfolio.

operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.81 billion was less than our net income of $1.82 billion, primarily due to the following factors:
1.our net income included non-cash charges of $774 million, consisting primarily of the following significant items: share-based compensation of $593 million; depreciation expense and losses on the disposal of property, plant, and equipment of $402 million; changes in deferred income taxes of $(281) million; deferred commission amortization of $33 million; and intangible asset amortization of $20 million.
2.the non-cash charges outlined above were partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in $778 million of cash used in operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2023. inventory, including the transfer of equipment from inventory to property, plant, and equipment, increased by $713 million, primarily to address the growth in the business as well as to mitigate risks of disruption that could arise from supply or other matters. refer to the supplemental cash flow information in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. accounts receivable increased by $186 million, primarily due to the timing of billings and collections, table of contents and other accrued liabilities decreased by $33 million, primarily due to timing of income tax payments. the unfavorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue by $53 million, primarily due to collections of payments related to future services, an increase in accounts payable by $42 million, primarily due to the timing of billing and payments, an increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits by $35 million, primarily due to higher headcount and higher variable compensation, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets by $24 million, primarily due to a decrease in net investments in sales-type leases.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.49 billion exceeded our net income of $1.34 billion, primarily due to the following factors:
1.our net income included non-cash charges of $766 million, consisting primarily of the following significant items: share-based compensation of $513 million; depreciation expense and losses on the disposal of property, plant, and equipment of $338 million; changes in deferred income taxes of $(185) million; and net losses on investments, accretion, and amortization of $49 million.
2.the non-cash charges outlined above were partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in $619 million of cash used in operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2022. inventory, including the transfer of equipment from inventory to property, plant, and equipment, increased by $547 million, primarily to address the growth in the business as well as to mitigate risks of disruption that could arise from trade, supply, or other matters. refer to further details in the supplemental cash flow information in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. accounts receivable increased by $159 million, primarily due to the timing of billings and collections. prepaid expenses and other assets increased by $129 million, primarily due to an increase in net investments in sales-type leases and an increase in recoverable vat related to growth in our ous activities. the unfavorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a $122 million increase in other liabilities, primarily due to additional accruals related to capital expenditures and timing of income tax payments, a $52 million increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits, primarily due to higher headcount and variable compensation, and a $21 million increase in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of billing and payments.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2023, consisted primarily of $1.06 billion paid for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of investments, net of purchases, of $0.71 billion.
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2022, consisted primarily of proceeds from maturities and sales of investments, net of purchases, of $1.92 billion, partially offset by $532 million paid for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2021, consisted primarily of purchases of investments, net of proceeds from maturities and sales, of $2.10 billion and $340 million paid for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment.
we invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. our investment portfolio may, at any time, contain investments in u.s. treasury and u.s. government agency securities, taxable and tax-exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, non-u.s. government agency securities, cash deposits, and money market funds.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2023, consisted primarily of cash used in the repurchase of approximately 1.7 million shares of our common stock for $416 million and taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlements of vested employee equity awards of $165 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $296 million.
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2022, consisted primarily of cash used in the repurchase of approximately 11.2 million shares of our common stock for $2.61 billion, 8.5 million shares of which related to accelerated share buyback programs executed and settled during 2022 and further described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, and taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlements of vested employee equity awards of $194 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $234 million.
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2021, consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $277 million, partially offset by taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlements of vested employee equity awards of $212 million and the payment of deferred purchase consideration of $22 million.
table of contents capital expenditures our capital expenditures are increasing as we continue to build the company to supply our customers with highly differentiated products manufactured in highly automated factories to facilitate outstanding performance in product quality, availability, and cost. a significant portion of this investment involves the construction of facilities to expand our manufacturing and commercial capabilities. we have also been vertically integrating key technologies to develop a more robust supply chain and bring important products to market at attractive price points. these investments include increased ownership of our imaging pipelines, and investments in strategic instruments and accessories technologies that allow us to serve our customers better. we expect these capital investments to range between $1 billion and $1.2 billion in 2024, the majority of which will be facilities-related investments. we intend to fund these capital investments with cash generated from operations.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments operating leases. we lease spaces for our operations in the u.s. as well as in japan, china, israel, mexico, germany, south korea, the united kingdom, india, and other countries. we also lease automobiles for certain sales and field service employees. these leases have varying terms of up to 20 years. operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all of our non-cancellable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further details.
purchase commitments and obligations. total purchase commitments and obligations as of december 31, 2023, are estimated to be $2.37 billion, of which $2.13 billion is expected to be due within a year. these amounts include an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services, commitments for capital expenditures, including construction-related activities, for which we have not received the goods or services, and commitments for the acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. approximately one third of our estimated purchase commitments and obligations are facilities-related. although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. in addition to the above, we have committed to making potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration, and development arrangements. payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory, and/or commercial milestones. for instances in which the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.
2017 tax act deemed repatriation tax. as of december 31, 2023, our obligation associated with the deemed repatriation tax is $121 million, of which $54 million is due within a year. the remaining balance is expected to be paid in 2025.
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2023, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k promulgated under the exchange act.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap, which requires us to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions. see "note 2. summary of significant accounting policies," in notes to the consolidated financial statements, which is included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data," for a description of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. our most critical accounting estimates include:
•the valuation and recognition of investments, which impacts our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value and interest and other income, net, when we record impairments;
•the standalone selling prices used to allocate the contract consideration to the individual performance obligations, which impacts revenue recognition;
•the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross profit margins;
•the valuation of and assessment of the recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill and the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, which primarily impacts gross profit margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their amortization;

•the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and
•the estimate of probable loss associated with legal contingencies, which impacts accrued liabilities and operating expenses.
investments valuation fair value. our investments may include, at any time, a diversified portfolio of cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments in a variety of high-quality securities, including money market funds, u.s. treasury and u.s. government agency securities, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, non-u.s. government agency securities, and municipal notes, as well as equity investments with and without readily determinable value. the assessment of the fair value of investments can be difficult and subjective. gaap establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. valuation of level 1 and 2 instruments generally do not require significant management judgment, and the estimation is not difficult. level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. the determination of fair value for level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. there were no level 3 securities for the periods presented.
after determining the fair value of our available-for-sale instruments, we identify instruments with an amortized cost basis in excess of their estimated fair value. available-for-sale instruments in an unrealized loss position are written down to fair value through a charge to interest and other income, net in the consolidated statements of income, if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. for the remaining securities, we assess what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. factors considered in determining whether a credit-related loss exists include the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, the extent of the loss related to the credit of the issuer, and the expected cash flows from the security. these judgments could prove to be wrong, and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations.
no significant impairment charges were recorded during the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. as of december 31, 2023, and 2022, net unrealized losses on investments of $29.7 million and $154.2 million, net of tax, respectively, were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
revenue recognition. our system sale arrangements contain multiple products and services, including system(s), system components, system accessories, instruments, accessories, and services. other than services, we generally deliver all of the products upfront. each of these products and services is a distinct performance obligation. system accessories, instruments, accessories, and services are also sold on a standalone basis.
for multiple-element arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. standalone selling prices are based on observable prices at which we separately sell the products or services. if a standalone selling price is not directly observable, then we estimate the standalone selling prices considering market conditions and entity-specific factors including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the products and services, geographies, type of customer, and market conditions. we regularly review standalone selling prices and maintain internal controls over establishing and updating these estimates.
our system sales arrangements generally include a five-year period of service. the first year of service is generally free and included in the system sale arrangement, and the remaining four years are billed at a stated service price. revenue that is allocated to the service obligation is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period.
inventory valuation. inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. the cost basis of our inventory is reduced for any products that are considered excess or obsolete based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill. we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration, including contingent consideration, to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest is recorded as goodwill. when determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest, management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. the estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows, and the determination of the assets' life cycle. these estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made.
table of contents our intangible assets include identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. identifiable intangible assets include developed technology, patents, distribution rights, customer relationships, licenses, and non-competition arrangements. currently, all of our identifiable intangible assets have finite lives. goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review (or more frequent if impairment indicators arise) by applying a fair value-based test. there have been no such impairments.
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these identifiable intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. if the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges.
the valuation and classification of intangible assets and goodwill and the assignment of useful lives for purposes of amortization involves judgments and the use of estimates. the evaluation of these intangible assets and goodwill for impairment under established accounting principles is required on a recurring basis. changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to the assumptions made. when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization over the assets' new, shorter useful lives. no impairment charges or accelerated amortization were recorded for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing impairment, which includes financial forecasts. if conditions are different from management's current estimates, material write-downs of long-lived assets may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results.
accounting for income taxes. significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with gaap. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease in our tax provision in the current period or subsequent periods.
also, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. in the event that all or part of our deferred tax assets are not recoverable in the future, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be recoverable. in order for our deferred tax assets to be recoverable, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. we consider forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, in determining the need for a valuation allowance. as of december 31, 2023, we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will ultimately be recovered, with the exception of our california deferred tax assets and a portion of our swiss deferred tax assets. we believe that, due to the computation of california taxes under the single sales factor, it is more likely than not that our california deferred tax assets of $202.5 million will not be realized. additionally, given certain limitations prescribed by the swiss tax authority on the utilization of some of our swiss deferred tax assets, we believe that it is more likely than not that $67.3 million of the swiss deferred tax assets will not be realized based on the future forecasted income of our swiss entity. our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if our estimates of future forecasted income do not support the realization of our deferred tax assets. should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period in which such change takes place.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, then the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effective settlement of audit issues, and new audit activity. such a change in the recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
accounting for legal contingencies.  from time to time, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings involving product liability, intellectual property, shareholder derivative actions, securities class actions, insurance, employee-related, and other matters. we record a liability and related charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements for legal contingencies when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. our assessment is re-evaluated each accounting period and is based on all available information, including discussion with any outside legal counsel that represents us. if a reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss cannot be made, but a range of probable losses can be table of contents estimated, the low-end of the range of losses is recognized if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other. if a loss is reasonably possible, but not probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
when determining the estimated probable loss or range of losses, significant judgment is required to be exercised in order to estimate the amount and timing of the loss to be recorded. estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation are inherently difficult to make, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete facts and information. the final outcome of legal proceedings is dependent on many variables and is difficult to predict and, therefore, the ultimate cost to entirely resolve such matters may be materially different than the amount of current estimates. consequently, new information or changes in judgments and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows.
recent accounting pronouncements see "note 2. summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for additional information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.

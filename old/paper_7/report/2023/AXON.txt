overview axon's product suite includes cloud-hosted digital evidence management, productivity and real-time operations software, body-worn cameras, in-car cameras, taser energy devices, robotic security and training solutions. our financial strategy is to build highly recurring, highly profitable businesses. axon products are generally cloud-connected, designed to drive better outcomes and customer experiences, and sold via mutually reinforcing integrated bundles.
axon's operations comprise two reportable segments:
1.    taser: axon is the market leader in the development, manufacture and sale of ceds, which we sell under our brand name, taser.

2.    software and sensors: we develop, manufacture and sell fully integrated hardware and cloud-based software solutions that enable law enforcement to capture, securely store, manage, share and analyze video and other digital evidence. our software offerings also support productivity and real-time operations.

we derive revenue from two primary sources: (i) the sale of physical products, including axon cameras, axon signal-enabled devices, ceds, corresponding hardware extended warranties, and related accessories such as axon docks, cartridges and batteries, among others, and (ii) subscriptions to our axon evidence digital evidence management saas offering (including data storage fees and other ancillary services), which includes varying levels of support. to a lesser extent, we also recognize revenue from training, professional services and other software and saas services.
some of our products and services are sold on a standalone basis. we also bundle our hardware products and services together and sell them to our customers in single transactions, where the customer can make payments over a multi-year period. these sales may include payments for upfront hardware and services, as well as payments for hardware and services to be provided by us at a future date.
our revenues for the year ended december 31, 2023 were $1.6 billion, an increase of $373.5 million, or 31.4%, from the prior year. we had income from operations of $154.8 million in 2023 compared to income from operations of $93.3 million in the prior year. gross margin dollars increased by $226.7 million in 2023 but remained relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to 2022. operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $165.2 million, reflecting an increase of $97.2 million in salaries, benefits and bonus expense and an increase in stock compensation of $23.2 million primarily related to an increase in headcount. for the year ended december 31, 2023, we recorded net income of $174.2 million, which reflected net unrealized losses of $80.5 million related to impairment and observable price changes for our existing investments and related warrants, interest income, net of $42.1 million, and an unrealized gain of $38.7 million on marketable securities related to our investment in cellebrite di ltd.

("clbt"). this represented an increase of $27.1 million over net income of $147.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, which included an unrealized gain of $131.9 million related to observable price changes for our existing investments and related warrants and an unrealized loss of $32.9 million related to clbt for the prior year.

(1) taser segment "other" includes smaller categories, such as vr hardware, ced training revenue such as revenue associated with our master instructor school, and taser consumer device sales.
(2) software and sensors segment "other" includes revenue from items including signal sidearm, interview room and axon air.
net sales for the taser segment for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $81.0 million, or 15.2%, primarily due to an increase of $51.2 million in taser devices (professional) and an $11.6 million increase in cartridge revenue. the increase in taser devices (professional) revenue was the result of increased unit sales and premium product mix. we continue to see strong adoption of our next generation product, taser 10, which began shipping in the first quarter of 2023. the increase in cartridge revenue was primarily attributable to growing sales of next generation taser products. net sales for axon evidence and cloud services increased $16.0 million due to an increase in the number of cloud-connected taser devices in the field, as well as an increase in vr revenue.
net sales for the software and sensors segment for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $292.4 million, or 44.4%, as we continue to add users and associated devices to our network. the increase in the aggregate number of users and average revenue per user, driven primarily by software add-ons, drove the majority of the increase in axon evidence and cloud services revenue of $194.3 million in addition to increased professional services revenue associated with new product installations, including axon fleet cameras. the $55.1 million increase in axon fleet systems revenue was primarily driven by higher unit sales. net sales of axon body cameras and accessories increased $25.7 million on higher volume driven by demand for our next generation product, axon body 4, which began shipping at the end of the second quarter of 2023. an increase in cameras and docks in the field drove the $12.8 million increase in extended warranties, as most of those devices are sold with extended warranties.
future contracted revenue - as of december 31, 2023 compared to december 31, 2022
total company future contracted revenue represents remaining performance obligation and includes both recognized contract liabilities as well as amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods. the remaining performance obligations are limited only to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under accounting standards codification topic 606 as of december 31, 2023. we currently expect to recognize between 15% to 25%

of this balance over the next 12 months, and generally expect the remainder to be recognized over the following ten years, subject to risks related to delayed deployments, budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. as of december 31, 2023, we had approximately $7.1 billion of future contracted revenue, an increase from $4.6 billion as of december 31, 2022.

gross margin increased $226.7 million to $955.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to $728.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2022. as a percentage of net sales, gross margin decreased slightly to 61.1% for 2023 from 61.2% for 2022. the decrease was due to lower gross margin in our taser segment and was partially offset by higher gross margin in our software and sensors segment.
as a percentage of total segment net sales, gross margin for the taser segment decreased to 60.5% for the year ended december 31, 2023, from 63.3% for the year ended december 31, 2022. the decrease was primarily due to inventory reserve charges realized in the first quarter of 2023 and warranty reserve charges recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to a taser 7 production issue that largely occurred in march 2023, combined with the launch of taser 10, which is still ramping up toward full-scale manufacturing.
within the software and sensors segment, gross margin as a percentage of total segment net sales increased to 61.5% for the year ended december 31, 2023 from 59.5% for the year ended december 31, 2022. within the software and sensors segment, hardware gross margin was 45.6% for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to 42.1% for the same period in 2022, while service margin decreased to 72.6% from 73.3%, respectively, during each of those same time periods. the increase in gross margin was driven by a premium product mix and scale efficiencies, partially offset by a higher mix of lower-margin professional services revenue.
we anticipate an increase in stock-based compensation expense reflected within cost of goods sold as a result of rsus granted in january 2024 that generally vest in five annual installments from march 2024 through march 2028. these rsus were granted to employees whose compensation was under a specified threshold, including production-line employees. as further discussed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included within this annual report on form 10-k, patrick w. smith, our chief executive officer, agreed to compensation in a lesser amount than the compensation committee of our board of directors was otherwise willing to provide so that the company could instead provide enhanced compensation opportunities to other employees of the company. if instead he had accepted higher compensation, it would have been reflected in sg&a expenses over a similar period.

sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $19.3 million as compared to the prior year, driven by a $16.3 million increase in commissions expense tied to higher revenues. sales and marketing expenses were also impacted by an increase of $3.6 million related to in-person events in 2023, including our annual user conference, axon accelerate.
stock-based compensation expense for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $7.2 million as compared to the prior year, which is primarily attributable to increased headcount combined with a $4.9 million increase in expenses related to the vesting of the final three tranches of the 2019 xspp. partially offsetting the increases was a decrease of $11.5 million related to the 2018 ceo performance award as the award became fully amortized with the vesting of the final two tranches.
other sg&a expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by $14.6 million as compared to the prior year, reflecting higher headcount and the following:
●   travel expenses increased $4.8 million, reflecting increased in-person customer and vendor meetings. increased travel costs per trip also impacted travel expenses.

net sales within the taser segment for the three months ended december 31, 2023 decreased by $1.2 million, or 0.8%, as compared to the prior quarter, primarily driven by lower taser cartridge revenue, partially offset by growth in taser devices (professional). the $10.5 million decrease in cartridge revenue was due to lower international volume. fluctuations in cartridge revenue are generally attributable to customers who are not on cartridge subscriptions plans and periodically purchase in bulk. taser devices (professional) increased by $8.0 million due to higher volume and premium product mix.
net sales for the software and sensors segment for the three months ended december 31, 2023 increased $19.8 million, or 7.9%, as compared to the prior quarter, as we continue to add users and associated devices to our network. the increase in the aggregate number of users and average revenue per user, driven primarily by software add-ons, drove the majority of the increase in axon evidence and cloud services revenue of $14.6 million. net sales of axon body cameras and accessories increased $6.5 million due to higher volume. partially offsetting the increases in the software and sensors segment was a decrease of $4.2 million in axon fleet revenue primarily reflecting lower unit volume due to timing of shipments related to customer-driven deployment schedules.
international sales were $48.9 million for the three months ended december 31, 2023 as compared to $71.5 million for the three months ended september 30, 2023, a decrease of $22.6 million, primarily driven by large hardware orders in the prior quarter.
non-gaap financial measures to supplement our financial results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"), we present the non-gaap financial measures of ebitda and adjusted ebitda as defined below. we have included ebitda and adjusted ebitda in this annual report on form 10-k because they are key measures used by our management team in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and evaluating our operational performance in comparison to prior periods. we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-gaap financial measures in assessing our performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. a reconciliation of gaap to the non-gaap financial measures is presented below.
●   ebitda (most comparable gaap measure: net income) - earnings before interest expense, investment interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.

●   adjusted ebitda (most comparable gaap measure: net income) - earnings before interest expense, investment interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, fair value adjustments to strategic investments and marketable securities, transaction costs related to acquisitions and investments, and other unusual, non-recurring pre-tax items that are not considered representative of our underlying operating performance.

although these non-gaap financial measures are not consistent with gaap, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-gaap financial measures when assessing our operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. however, management recognizes that:
●   these non-gaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered only as a supplement to our gaap financial measures;

●   these non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, our gaap financial measures;

●   these non-gaap financial measures should not be considered to be superior to our gaap financial measures; and

52
●   these non-gaap financial measures were not prepared in accordance with gaap and investors should not assume that the non-gaap financial measures presented in this annual report on form 10-k were prepared under a comprehensive set of rules or principles propounded by a third party.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 of $189.3 million consisted of $174.2 million in net income, a net add-back of non-cash income statement items totaling $133.4 million and a $118.4 million net change in operating assets and liabilities. included in the non-cash items were $131.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, a
53
$41.8 million net loss from impairment and changes in fair values of strategic investments and marketable securities, $32.6 million in depreciation and amortization expense and a $73.0 million increase in deferred income tax assets. cash provided by operations was impacted by an increase of $172.5 million in accounts and notes receivable and contract assets, an increase of $102.4 million in prepaid expenses and other assets and an increase of $71.9 million in inventory. the increase in accounts and notes receivable and contract assets was largely attributable to increased sales in 2023, particularly for sales made under subscription plans. the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was attributable to an increase in deferred commissions related to increased bookings, higher deferred cost of goods sold related to increased sales of axon air and axon fleet and timing of certain prepayments for supplier contracts and license agreements. inventory increases were a result of advance purchases to support future sales.
partially offsetting this activity was an increase in deferred revenue of $164.0 million and an increase in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities of $64.4 million. the increase in deferred revenue was primarily attributable to increased subscription invoicing for software and sensors hardware and services in advance of fulfillment and a smaller increase in hardware deferred revenue from taser subscription sales. the increase in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities included a higher bonus accrual reflecting higher attainment on the 2023 cash incentive program, an increase in warranty reserves and the timing of purchases and payments.
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was $12.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2023. this included $111.4 million of proceeds from calls and maturities, net of purchases of available-for-sale investments. we invested $59.5 million in the purchase of property and equipment and intangibles, net of proceeds on disposals and $37.3 million for business acquisitions and strategic investments.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was $41.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2023. this was primarily attributable to net proceeds of $94.7 million received from our "at the market" equity offering program and $54.5 million from the exercise of stock options where shares were sold to cover the exercise price. partially offsetting the cash inflows was a payment of $107.9 million for income and payroll taxes on behalf of employees who net-settled stock awards during the period, primarily related to the vesting of three tranches of the 2019 xspp.
liquidity and capital resources our most significant source of liquidity continues to be funds generated by operating activities and available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. in addition, our $200.0 million revolving credit facility is available for additional working capital needs or investment opportunities. under the terms of the line of credit, available borrowings are reduced by outstanding letters of credit. advances under the line of credit bear interest at term sofr plus 1.25 to 1.75% per year determined in accordance with a pricing grid based on our net debt to ebitda ratio, which for purposes of the credit agreement excludes investment interest income. "sofr" is defined as a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the federal reserve bank of new york or a successor administrator of the secured overnight financing rate.
as of december 31, 2023, we had letters of credit outstanding of $7.5 million, leaving the net amount available for borrowing of $192.5 million. the credit agreement will mature on the earlier of december 15, 2027 or the date that is six months prior to the stated maturity date of the notes unless the notes have been redeemed, repurchased, converted or defeased in full. additionally, the credit agreement has an accordion feature that allows for an increase in the total line of credit up to $300.0 million, in each lender's sole discretion. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under the line.
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility.
54
our agreement with the bank requires us to comply with a net leverage ratio, defined as consolidated total indebtedness to ebitda, of no greater than 3.50 to 1.00 based upon a trailing four fiscal quarter period. at december 31, 2023, our net leverage ratio was 0.10 to 1.00. additionally, we must comply with a consolidated interest coverage ratio, defined as ebitda to consolidated interest expense, of no less than 3.50 to 1.00 based upon a trailing four fiscal quarter end. at december 31, 2023, our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 45.61 to 1.00.
taser subscription and installment purchase arrangements typically involve amounts invoiced in five equal installments at the beginning of each year of the five-year term. this is in contrast to a traditional ced sale in which the entire amount being charged for the hardware is invoiced upon shipment. this impacts liquidity in a commensurate fashion, with the cash for the subscription or installment purchase received in five annual installments rather than up front. our strategy includes continuing to shift an increasing amount of our business to a subscription model, to better match the municipal budgeting process of our customers as well as to allow for multiple product offerings to be bundled into existing subscriptions. we carefully considered the cash flow impacts of this strategic shift and regularly revisit our cash flow forecast with the goal of maintaining a comfortable level of liquidity as we continue to offer products and services in which we incur upfront cash costs to produce and fulfill hardware sales ahead of the cash inflows from our customers.
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and investments and credit capacity under our existing credit facility. additionally, we believe we have access to additional financing. however, there is no assurance that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
we believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements, including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions or investments, income and payroll tax payments for net-settled stock awards, and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. we and our board of directors may consider repurchases of our common stock. further repurchases of our common stock would take place on the open market, would be financed with available cash and are subject to authorization as well as market and business conditions.
contractual obligations the following table outlines our future contractual financial obligations by period in which payment is expected, as of december 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

short                long total                 term                 term operating lease obligations (1)                                      $74,672               $10,594              $64,078
purchase obligations                                                         780,726              500,542               280,184
principal and interest payable on our convertible senior notes               703,445                3,450               699,995
total contractual obligations                                        $1,558,843            $514,586             $1,044,257
(1)   includes obligations of two leases that were executed as of december 31, 2023 but had not yet commenced.

purchase obligations in the table above represent $429.5 million of open purchase orders and $351.2 million of other purchase obligations. the open purchase orders represent both cancelable and non-cancelable purchase orders with key vendors, which are included in this table due to our strategic relationships with these vendors.
for additional information regarding the notes, refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included within this annual report on form 10-k.
we are subject to u.s. federal income tax as well as income taxes imposed by state and foreign jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2023, we had $25.8 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. the settlement period for these long-term income tax liabilities cannot be determined; however, the liabilities are expected to increase by approximately $6.1 million within the next 12 months. the obligations related to our uncertain tax
55
positions have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of any settlement.
critical accounting estimates we have identified the following accounting estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the preparation of this annual report on form 10-k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. while we do not believe that a change in these estimates is reasonably likely, there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from these estimates. the effect of these estimates on our business operations is discussed below.
warranty reserves we warranty our ceds, axon cameras and certain related accessories from manufacturing defects on a limited basis for a period of one year after purchase and, thereafter, will replace any defective unit for a fee. the company estimates and records a liability for standard warranty at the time products are sold. the estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management's best estimates of costs to be incurred over the warranty period. adjustments may be required when actual or projected costs differ. variations in component failure rates, repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle are key drivers that impact our periodic re-assessment of the warranty liability.
as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, our warranty reserve was approximately $7.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively. warranty expense for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $8.1 million, $0.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively. warranty expense for the year ended december 31, 2023 was impacted by warranty claims on taser 7. warranty expense for the year ended december 31, 2022 was impacted by lower than expected warranty claims for the axon body cameras and taser 7 devices. warranty expense for the year ended december 31, 2021 was impacted by higher battery degradation resulting in shorter battery lives for the axon body 3 camera and warranty claims for taser 7 devices.
revenue related to separately priced extended warranties is initially recorded as deferred revenue at its allocated amount and subsequently recognized as net sales on a straight-line basis over the warranty service period. costs related to extended warranties are charged to cost of product and service sales when the costs become probable and can be reasonably estimated.
inventory inventories are stated at lower of cost or realizable values. cost of inventories are determined on the first-in, first-out basis utilizing a standard cost methodology. additional provisions are made to reduce excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventories to their net realizable value. these provisions are based on management's best estimate after considering historical demand, projected future demand, inventory purchase commitments, industry and market trends and conditions among other factors. we evaluate inventory costs for abnormal costs due to excess production capacity and treat such costs as period costs.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recorded provisions to reduce inventories to their lower of cost and net realizable value of approximately $5.4 million compared to $1.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2022.
revenue recognition, deferred revenue and accounts and notes receivable and contract assets we derive revenue from two primary sources: (1) the sale of physical products, including ceds, axon cameras, axon signal-enabled devices, corresponding hardware extended warranties, and related accessories such as axon
56
docks, cartridges and batteries, among others, and (2) subscriptions to our axon evidence digital evidence management saas offering (including data storage fees and other ancillary services), which includes varying levels of support. to a lesser extent, we also recognize revenue from training, professional services and other software and saas services. we apply the five-step model outlined in accounting standards codification topic 606, revenue from contracts from customers ("topic 606"). for additional discussion of topic 606, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included within this annual report on form 10-k.
a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in topic 606. for contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.
revenues are recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which is generally distinct and accounted for as a separate performance obligation. revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns.
performance obligations to deliver products, including ceds, axon cameras and related accessories, such as docks, cartridges and batteries, are generally satisfied at the point in time we ship the product, as this is when the customer obtains control of the asset under our standard terms and conditions. in certain contracts with non-standard terms and conditions, these performance obligations may not be satisfied until formal customer acceptance occurs. performance obligations to fulfill service-type extended warranties and provide our saas offerings, including axon evidence and other cloud services, are generally satisfied over time as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of these services over the stated service period.
many of our products and services are sold on a standalone basis. we also bundle our hardware products and services together and sell them to our customers in single transactions where the customer can make payments over a multi-year period. these sales may include payments for upfront hardware and services, as well as payments for hardware and services to be provided by us at a future date.
additionally, we offer customers the ability to purchase ced cartridges and certain services on an unlimited basis over the contractual term. due to the unlimited nature of these arrangements whereby we are obligated to deliver unlimited products at the customer's request, we account for these arrangements as stand-ready obligations and recognize revenue ratably over the contract period. cost of product sales is recognized when control of hardware products or accessories have transferred to the customer.
we have elected to recognize shipping costs as an expense in cost of product sales when the control of hardware products or accessories have transferred to the customer.
sales tax collected on sales is netted against government remittances and, thus, recorded on a net basis.
the timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. we generally have an unconditional right to consideration when we invoice our customers and record a receivable. we record a contract asset when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or a contract liability (deferred revenue) when revenue will be recognized subsequent to invoicing. contract asset amounts that will be invoiced during the subsequent 12-month period from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets and the remaining portion is recorded within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. deferred revenue that will be recognized during the subsequent 12-month period from the balance sheet date is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as long-term deferred revenue. generally, customers are billed in annual installments. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements withn this annual report on form 10-k for further disclosures about our contract assets.
sales are typically made on credit, and we generally do not require collateral. we are exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of products and services. our expected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable,
57
notes receivable, and contract assets is developed using historical collection experience, published or estimated credit default rates for entities that represent our customer base, current and future economic and market conditions, and a review of the current status of customers' trade accounts receivables. we review receivables for u.s. and international customers separately to better reflect different published credit default rates and economic and market conditions. additionally, specific reserve amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. our monitoring activities include account reconciliation, dispute resolution, payment confirmation, consideration of customers' financial condition and macroeconomic conditions. balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible.
valuation of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets we evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of these assets may not be recoverable. such circumstances could include a change in the product mix, a change in the way products are created, produced or delivered, or a significant change in the way products are branded and marketed. in performing the review for recoverability, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss, if impairment exists, is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amounts of the assets over their estimated fair values computed using discounted cash flows.
finite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives; rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. we perform our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recorded $0.3 million of impairment charges primarily related to construction in process. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded $5.3 million of impairment charges. of this total, $3.3 million related to the cease-use of a portion of our seattle office. an additional $1.4 million related to the decision to slow pacing on construction of our new scottsdale, arizona campus. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we recorded an immaterial amount of impairment charges.
income taxes we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. we also recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards.
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. we must also assess whether uncertain tax positions as filed could result in the recognition of a liability for possible interest and penalties if any. we have completed r&d tax credit studies for each year a tax credit was claimed for federal and state income tax purposes. we determined that it was more likely than not that the full benefit of the r&d tax credit would not be sustained on examination and accordingly, have established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $25.8 million as of december 31, 2023. we expect the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit to increase by approximately $6.1 million within the next 12 months. should the unrecognized tax benefit of $25.8 million be recognized, our effective tax rate would be favorably impacted. our estimates are based on information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provision. our income tax returns are subject to audit by u.s. federal, state, local and foreign governments, generally years after the returns are filed. these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws.
58
our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting or tax laws domestically and internationally, or changes in other facts or circumstances. in addition, we recognize liabilities for potential tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, or if the actual tax liability is greater than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit, or additional income tax expense, respectively, in our consolidated financial statements.
in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including operating results, ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. a valuation allowance is established if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business.
we have state net operating losses of $17.5 million, which do not expire until 2041. we anticipate sufficient future pre-tax book income to realize a large portion of our deferred tax assets. however, based on expected income for years in which arizona r&d tax credits are set to expire, unrealized investment losses for which realization is uncertain, and specific identified intangibles with an indefinite life, a reserve of $21.6 million has been recorded as a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2023.
in december 2021, the oecd published a framework for pillar two of the global anti-base erosion rules ("globe"). the globe rules were designed to coordinate participating jurisdictions in updating the international tax system to ensure that large multinational companies pay a minimum level of income tax. recommendations from the oecd regarding a global minimum income tax and other changes are being considered and/or implemented in jurisdictions where we operate. we believe enactment of the recommended framework in jurisdictions where we operate will result in minimal impacts to our financial results in the near term.
stock-based compensation we have historically granted stock-based compensation to key employees and non-employee directors as a means of attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel. stock-based compensation awards primarily consist of service-based rsus, performance-based rsus, and performance-based stock options. our stock-based compensation awards are classified as equity and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. when determining the grant date fair value of stock-based awards, we consider whether an adjustment is required to the observable market price or volatility of our common stock used in the valuation as a result of material non-public information. for service-based awards, we recognize rsu expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period. vesting of performance-based rsus is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria related to our operating performance, as well as successful and timely development and market acceptance of future product introductions. for performance-based rsus containing only performance conditions, compensation cost is recognized using the graded attribution model over the explicit or implicit service period. for awards containing multiple service, performance or market conditions, where all conditions must be satisfied prior to vesting, compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is defined as the longest explicit, implicit or derived service period, based on management's estimate of the probability and timing of the performance criteria being satisfied, adjusted at each balance sheet date. for both service-based and performance-based rsus, we account for forfeitures as they occur as a reduction to stock-based compensation expense and additional paid-in-capital.
for performance-based options, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance goals when the achievement of each individual performance goal becomes probable. for performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both
59
performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement. the fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulations. refer to note 15 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements within this annual report on form 10-k.
we have granted a total of approximately 15.6 million performance-based awards (options and rsus) of which approximately 0.9 million are outstanding as of december 31, 2023, the vesting of which is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria including the successful development and market acceptance of future product introductions as well as our future sales targets and operating performance and market capitalization. of the 0.9 million performance-based awards that are outstanding, 0.5 million are options that are exercisable. compensation expense for performance awards will be recognized based on management's best estimate of the probability of the performance criteria being satisfied using the most currently available projections of future product adoption and operating performance, adjusted at each balance sheet date. changes in the subjective and probability-based assumptions can materially affect the estimates of the fair value of the awards and timing of recognition of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive income.
contingencies and accrued litigation expense we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including product-related and other litigation. we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements within this annual report on form 10-k.
reserve for expected credit losses we are exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of products and services. our expected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable, contract assets, notes receivable and off-balance-sheet exposures is developed using historical collection experience, published or estimated credit default rates for entities that represent our customer base, current and future economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of customers' trade accounts receivables. additionally, specific allowance amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. our monitoring activities include account reconciliation, dispute resolution, payment confirmation, consideration of customers' financial condition and macroeconomic conditions. balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible.
we review receivables for u.s. and international customers separately to better reflect different published credit default rates and economic and market conditions.
a majority of our customers are government agencies. due to municipal government funding rules, certain of our contracts are subject to appropriation, termination for convenience, or similar cancellation clauses, which could allow our customers to cancel or not exercise options to renew contracts in the future. economic slowdowns that negatively affect municipal tax collections and put pressure on law enforcement may increase this risk and negatively impact the realizability of our accounts and notes receivable and contract assets.
based on the balances of our financial instruments as of december 31, 2023, a hypothetical 25% increase in expected credit loss rates across all pools would result in a $0.8 million increase in the allowance for expected credit losses.

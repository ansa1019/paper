consumers overwhelmingly turn to the internet and mobile devices for real estate information and services. the digital real estate services segment's success depends on its continued innovation to provide products and services that are useful for consumers and real estate, mortgage and financial services professionals, homebuilders and landlords and attractive to its advertisers. the digital real estate services segment operates in a highly competitive digital environment with other operators of real estate and property websites and mobile apps.
subscription video services the company's subscription video services segment consists of (i) its 65% interest in the foxtel group and (ii) anc. the foxtel group is the largest australian-based subscription television provider, with a suite of offerings including its foxtel pay-tv and kayo sports, binge and foxtel now streaming services. the foxtel group generates revenue primarily through subscription revenue as well as advertising revenue.
the foxtel group competes for audiences primarily with a variety of other video content providers, such as traditional free-to-air ("fta") tv operators in australia, including the three major commercial fta networks and two major government-funded fta broadcasters, and content providers that deliver video programming over the internet. these providers include, internet protocol television, or iptv, subscription video-on-demand and broadcast video-on-demand providers; streaming services offered through digital media providers; as well as programmers and distributors that provide content directly to consumers over the internet.
anc operates the sky news network, australia's 24-hour multi-channel, multi-platform news service, and also owns and operates the australia channel iptv service for international markets. revenue is primarily derived from monthly affiliate fees received from pay-tv providers and advertising.
the most significant operating expenses of the subscription video services segment are the acquisition and production expenses related to programming, the expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the broadcast operations, expenses related to satellite, data and cable-related transmission costs and studio and engineering expense. the expenses associated with licensing certain sports programming rights are recognized during the applicable season or event, which can cause results at the subscription video services segment to fluctuate based on the timing and mix of the foxtel group's local and international sports programming. sports programming rights costs associated with a dedicated channel are amortized over 12 months. other expenses include subscriber acquisition costs such as sales costs and marketing and promotional expenses related to improving the market visibility and awareness of the channels and their programming. additional expenses include salaries, employee benefits, technology, rent and other routine overhead expenses.
dow jones the dow jones segment's products target individual consumers and enterprise customers. revenue from the dow jones segment's consumer business is derived primarily from circulation, which includes subscription and single-copy sales of its digital and print consumer products, the sale of digital and print advertising, licensing fees for its print and digital consumer content and table of contents participation fees for its live journalism events. circulation revenues are dependent on the content of the dow jones segment's consumer products, prices of its and/or competitors' products, as well as promotional activities and news cycles. advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including demand for the dow jones segment's consumer products, general economic and business conditions, demographics of the customer base, advertising rates and effectiveness and brand strength and reputation. certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of dow jones's advertising revenues, including technology and finance, which were particularly affected by economic and market conditions in fiscal 2023. advertising revenues are also subject to seasonality, with revenues typically highest in the company's second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season. in addition, the consumer print business faces challenges from alternative media formats and shifting consumer preferences, which have adversely affected, and are expected to continue to adversely affect, both print circulation and advertising revenues. advertising, in particular, has been impacted by the shift in advertising spending from print to digital. the increasing range of advertising choices and formats has resulted in audience fragmentation and increased competition. technologies, regulations, policies and practices have also been and will continue to be developed and implemented that make it more difficult to target and measure the effectiveness of digital advertising, which may impact digital advertising rates or revenues. as a multi-platform news provider, the dow jones segment seeks to maximize revenues from a variety of media formats and platforms, including leveraging its content through licensing arrangements with third-party distribution platforms, developing new advertising models and growing its live journalism events business, and continues to invest in its digital and other products, which represent an increasingly larger share of revenues at its consumer business. mobile devices, their related apps and other technologies, provide continued opportunities for the dow jones segment to make its content available to a new audience of readers, introduce new or different pricing schemes and develop its products to continue to attract advertisers and/or affect the relationship between content providers and consumers.
operating expenses for the consumer business include costs related to paper, production, distribution, third party printing, editorial and commissions. selling, general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses, salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead. the costs associated with printing and distributing newspapers, including paper prices and delivery costs, are key operating expenses whose fluctuations can have a material effect on the results of the dow jones segment's consumer business. the consumer business is affected by the cyclical changes in the price of paper and other factors that may affect paper prices, including, among other things, inflation, supply chain disruptions, industry trends or economics and tariffs or other restrictions on non-u.s. paper suppliers. in addition, the dow jones segment relies on third parties for much of the printing and distribution of its print products. the shift from print to digital and changing labor markets present challenges to the financial and operational stability of these third parties which could, in turn, impact the availability, or increase the cost, of third-party printing and distribution services for the company's newspapers.
the dow jones segment's consumer products compete for consumers, audience and advertising with other local and national newspapers, web and app-based media, news aggregators, customized news feeds, search engines, blogs, magazines, investment tools, social media sources, podcasts and event producers, as well as other media such as television, radio stations and outdoor displays. as a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies (including recent developments in artificial intelligence (ai), particularly generative ai), distribution platforms and business models, and corresponding changes in consumer behavior, the consumer business continues to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue, including from a variety of alternative news and information sources, as well as programmatic advertising buying channels and off-platform distribution of its products.
the dow jones segment's professional information business, which targets enterprise customers, derives revenue primarily from subscriptions to its professional information products. the professional information business serves enterprise customers with products that combine news and information with technology and tools that inform decisions and aid awareness, research, understanding and compliance. the success of the professional information business depends on its ability to provide products, services, applications and functionalities that meet the needs of its enterprise customers, who operate in information-intensive and oftentimes highly regulated industries such as finance and insurance. the professional information business must also anticipate and respond to industry trends and regulatory and technological changes.
significant expenses for the professional information business include development costs, sales and marketing expenses, hosting and support services, royalties, salaries, consulting and professional fees, sales commissions, employee benefits and other routine overhead expenses.
the dow jones segment's professional information products compete with various information service providers, compliance data providers, global financial newswires and energy and commodities pricing and data providers, including reuters news, relx (including lexisnexis and icis), refinitiv, s&p global, dtn and argus media, as well as many other providers of news, information and compliance data.
table of contents book publishing the book publishing segment derives revenues from the sale of general fiction, nonfiction, children's and religious books in the u.s. and internationally. the revenues and operating results of the book publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of its books in the marketplace. the book publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. this marketplace is highly competitive and continues to change due to technological developments, including additional digital platforms, such as e-books and downloadable audiobooks, and distribution channels and other factors. each book is a separate and distinct product and its financial success depends upon many factors, including public acceptance.
major new title releases represent a significant portion of the book publishing segment's sales throughout the fiscal year. print-based consumer books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. in the domestic and international markets, the book publishing segment is subject to global trends and local economic conditions, including supply chain challenges and inflationary and inventory pressures during fiscal 2023, which are expected to moderate in fiscal 2024. operating expenses for the book publishing segment include costs related to paper, printing, freight, authors' royalties, editorial, promotional, art and design expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead costs.
news media revenue at the news media segment is derived primarily from circulation and subscriptions, the sale of advertising, as well as licensing. circulation and subscription revenues can be greatly affected by changes in the prices of the company's and/or competitors' products, as well as by promotional activities and news cycles. adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising have affected, and may continue to affect, revenues. advertising revenues at the news media segment are also subject to seasonality, with revenues typically being highest in the company's second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies.
operating expenses include costs related to paper, production, distribution, third party printing, editorial, commissions, technology and radio sports rights. selling, general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses, salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead. the cost of paper is a key operating expense whose fluctuations can have a material effect on the results of the segment. the news media segment continues to be exposed to risks associated with paper used for printing. paper is a basic commodity and its price is sensitive to the balance of supply and demand. the news media segment's expenses are affected by the cyclical changes in the price of paper and other factors that may affect paper prices, including, among other things, inflation, supply chain disruptions, industry trends or economics (including the closure or conversion of newsprint mills) and tariffs. the news media segment experienced significant paper price increases in fiscal 2023. while the company anticipates these increases will moderate, it expects prices to remain elevated.
the news media segment's products compete for readership, audience and advertising with local and national competitors and also compete with other media alternatives in their respective markets. competition for circulation and subscriptions is based on the content of the products provided, pricing and, from time to time, various promotions. the success of these products also depends upon advertisers' judgments as to the most effective use of their advertising budgets. competition for advertising is based upon the reach of the products, advertising rates and advertiser results. such judgments are based on factors such as cost, availability of alternative media, distribution and quality of consumer demographics. as a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies (including recent developments in ai, particularly generative ai), distribution platforms and business models, and corresponding changes in consumer behavior, the news media segment continues to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue.
the news media segment's print business faces challenges from alternative media formats and shifting consumer preferences. the news media segment is also exposed to the impact of the shift in advertising spending from print to digital. these alternative media formats could impact the segment's overall performance, positively or negatively. in addition, technologies, regulations, policies and practices have been and will continue to be developed and implemented that make it more difficult to target and measure the effectiveness of digital advertising, which may impact digital advertising rates or revenues.
as multi-platform news providers, the businesses within the news media segment seek to maximize revenues from a variety of media formats and platforms, including leveraging their content through licensing arrangements with third-party distribution platforms and developing new advertising models, and continue to invest in their digital products. mobile devices, their related apps and other technologies, provide continued opportunities for the businesses within the news media segment to make their content available to a new audience of readers, introduce new or different pricing schemes and develop their products to continue to attract advertisers and/or affect the relationship between content providers and consumers.
table of contents other the other segment primarily consists of general corporate overhead expenses, strategy costs and costs related to the u.k. newspaper matters.

**    not meaningful revenues-revenues decreased $506 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. the decrease, which includes the approximately $110 million impact of the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, was driven in part by lower revenues at the book publishing segment primarily due to lower print and digital book sales, mainly in the u.s. market, driven by lower consumer demand industry-wide, weak frontlist performance, amazon's reset of its inventory levels and rightsizing of its warehouse footprint and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the decrease was also driven by lower revenues at the digital real estate services segment primarily due to lower real estate revenues at move, the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and lower financial services revenue at rea group and at the news media and subscription video services segments due to the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. these decreases were partially offset by higher revenues at the dow jones segment primarily due to the acquisitions of opis and cma. digital revenues accounted for approximately 50% of total revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023.
table of contents the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $494 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. the company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar by multiplying the results for each quarter in the current period by the difference between the average exchange rate for that quarter and the average exchange rate in effect during the corresponding quarter of the prior year and totaling the impact for all quarters in the current period.
operating expenses-operating expenses were flat for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. operating expenses at the dow jones segment increased due to the impact from recent acquisitions. the increase was offset by lower operating expenses at the book publishing segment driven by the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as the impact of lower sales volumes offset higher manufacturing, freight and distribution costs, and at the news media segment due to the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as the $60 million impact of higher pricing on newsprint costs and higher costs for talktv and other digital investments, primarily at news corp australia, were partially offset by cost savings initiatives. operating expenses at the subscription video services segment were also lower due to the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, largely offset by higher sports and entertainment programming costs. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in an operating expense decrease of $242 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022.
selling, general and administrative-selling, general and administrative decreased $257 million, or 7%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. the decrease in selling, general and administrative for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 was primarily driven by lower expenses at the digital real estate services segment mainly due to the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, lower broker commissions at rea group's financial services business and lower discretionary spending and employee costs at move and at the news media segment due to the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher employee and marketing costs. selling, general and administrative also decreased at the subscription video services segment primarily due to the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and lower marketing costs and at the book publishing segment primarily due to lower employee costs and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. selling, general and administrative declined at the other segment primarily due to the absence of one-time legal settlement costs, partially offset by $10 million of one-time costs related to the professional fees incurred by the special committee and the company in connection with evaluating the proposal from the murdoch family trust, as well as fees related to the potential sale of move. selling, general and administrative at the dow jones segment benefited from the absence of $25 million of opis and cma-related transaction costs incurred in fiscal 2022 and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, offset by higher employee costs due to recent acquisitions. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a selling, general and administrative decrease of $172 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022.
depreciation and amortization-depreciation and amortization expense increased $26 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily driven by higher amortization expense resulting from the company's recent acquisitions. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a depreciation and amortization expense decrease of $35 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022.
impairment and restructuring charges-during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2023 and 2022, the company recorded restructuring charges of $125 million and $94 million, respectively.
during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $25 million related to the impairment of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets during the company's annual impairment assessment.
during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $15 million related to the write-down of fixed assets associated with the shutdown and sale of certain u.s. printing facilities at the dow jones segment.
see note 5-restructuring programs, note 7-property, plant and equipment and note 8-goodwill and other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
equity losses of affiliates-equity losses of affiliates increased by $114 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to a non-cash write-down of rea group's investment in propertyguru of approximately $81 million and losses from an investment in an australian sports wagering venture. see note 6-investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
interest expense, net-interest expense, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 increased $1 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2022. see note 9-borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
table of contents other, net-other, net decreased $51 million, or 98%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. the decrease was primarily due to the absence of rea group's gain on disposition of its entities in malaysia and thailand recognized in fiscal 2022. see note 21-additional financial information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
income tax expense-the company's income tax expense and effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 were $143 million and 43%, respectively, as compared to an income tax expense and effective tax rate of $52 million and 6%, respectively, for fiscal 2022.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023, the company recorded income tax expense of $143 million on pre-tax income of $330 million, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the u.s. statutory tax rate. the tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates, impairments and valuation allowances recorded against tax benefits in certain businesses.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, the company recorded income tax expense of $52 million on pre-tax income of $812 million, resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate. the tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates, offset by the reversal of valuation allowances, including $149 million related to certain foreign deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, the lower tax impact related to the sale of rea group's malaysia and thailand businesses and the remeasurement of deferred taxes in the u.k.
management assesses available evidence to determine whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of existing deferred tax assets. based on management's assessment of available evidence, it has been determined that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions may not be realized and therefore, a valuation allowance has been established against those tax assets. see note 19-income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
net income-net income was $187 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023, as compared to $760 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, a decrease of $573 million, or 75%, primarily driven by lower total segment ebitda, higher losses from equity affiliates, higher tax expense, lower other, net and higher impairment and restructuring charges.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests-net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $38 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023, as compared to $137 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, a decrease of $99 million, or 72%, primarily driven by the write-down of rea group's investment in propertyguru in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 and the impact of the absence of rea group's gain on disposition of its entities in malaysia and thailand recognized in fiscal 2022.
segment analysis segment ebitda is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. segment ebitda does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity losses of affiliates, interest (expense) income, net, other, net and income tax (expense) benefit. segment ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of segment ebitda.
segment ebitda is the primary measure used by the company's chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources within, the company's businesses. segment ebitda provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the company's business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors' data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).
total segment ebitda is a non-gaap measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap. in addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the company's financial performance. the company believes that the presentation of total segment ebitda provides useful information regarding the company's operations and other factors that affect the company's reported results. specifically, the company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as impairment and restructuring charges and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures and changes in tax positions or regimes, the company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its core operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the company believes are not representative of its core business. as a result, users of the company's consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the core operating results of the company across different periods.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023, revenues at the subscription video services segment decreased $84 million, or 4%, as compared to fiscal 2022 due to the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the $114 million increase in streaming revenues, primarily due to increased volume and pricing at kayo and binge, the $26 million increase in commercial subscription revenues due to the absence of covid-19 related restrictions imposed in fiscal 2022 and improvements in underlying advertising trends more than offset lower residential subscription revenues resulting from fewer residential broadcast subscribers. foxtel group streaming subscription revenues represented approximately 27% of total circulation and subscription revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023, as compared to 20% in fiscal 2022. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $157 million, or 8%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023, segment ebitda decreased $13 million, or 4%, as compared to fiscal 2022 due to the $29 million, or 8%, negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. higher sports programming rights and production costs due to contractual increases and enhanced digital rights and higher entertainment programming rights costs due to the availability of content were more than offset by the revenue drivers discussed above, as well as lower transmission and marketing costs.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023, revenues at the book publishing segment decreased $212 million, or 10%, as compared to fiscal 2022, driven by lower print and digital book sales, mainly in the u.s. market, driven by lower consumer demand industry-wide, weak frontlist performance, amazon's reset of its inventory levels and rightsizing of its warehouse footprint, which negatively impacted print book sales, the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the approximately $20 million impact of the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. digital sales decreased by 5% as compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower e-book sales. digital sales represented approximately 22% of consumer revenues, as compared to 21% in fiscal 2022, and backlist sales represented approximately 60% of total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $58 million, or 3%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023, segment ebitda at the book publishing segment decreased $139 million, or 45%, as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the lower revenues discussed above and higher manufacturing, freight and distribution costs related to ongoing supply chain challenges and inventory and inflationary pressures, partially offset by lower costs due to lower sales volumes and lower employee costs. these supply chain challenges and inventory and inflationary pressures are expected to continue to impact the business in the near term, but are expected to moderate in fiscal 2024. to mitigate these pressures, the company has implemented price increases, begun to reduce headcount and continues to evaluate its cost base.

liquidity and capital resources current financial condition the company's principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand. as of june 30, 2023, the company's cash and cash equivalents were $1,833 million. the company also has available borrowing capacity under the revolving facility and certain other facilities, as described below, and expects to have access to the worldwide credit and capital markets, subject to market conditions, in order to issue additional debt if needed or desired. the company currently expects these elements of liquidity will enable it to meet its liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months, including repayment of indebtedness. although the company believes that its cash on hand and future cash from operations, together with its access to the credit and capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs for at least the next 12 months, its access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) the financial and operational performance of the company and/or its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (ii) the company's credit ratings and/or the credit rating of its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (iii) the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents; (iv) the liquidity of the overall credit and capital markets; and (v) the state of the economy. there can be no assurances that the company will continue to have access to the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms.
as of june 30, 2023, the company's consolidated assets included $902 million in cash and cash equivalents that were held by its foreign subsidiaries. of this amount, $173 million is cash not readily accessible by the company as it is held by rea group, a table of contents majority owned but separately listed public company. rea group must declare a dividend in order for the company to have access to its share of rea group's cash balance. prior to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act ("tax act"), the company's undistributed foreign earnings were considered permanently reinvested and as such, united states federal and state income taxes were not previously recorded on these earnings. as a result of the tax act, substantially all of the company's earnings in foreign subsidiaries generated prior to the enactment of the tax act were deemed to have been repatriated and taxed accordingly. as of june 30, 2023, the company has approximately $800 million of undistributed foreign earnings that it intends to reinvest permanently. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if these earnings were repatriated. the company may repatriate future earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in which case the company may be required to accrue and pay additional taxes, including any applicable foreign withholding taxes and income taxes.
the principal uses of cash that affect the company's liquidity position include the following: operational expenditures including employee costs, paper purchases and programming costs; capital expenditures; income tax payments; investments in associated entities; acquisitions; the repurchase of shares; dividends; and the repayment of debt and related interest. in addition to the acquisitions and dispositions disclosed elsewhere, the company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible future acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the issuance of the company's securities or the assumption of indebtedness.
issuer purchases of equity securities the board of directors has authorized a repurchase program to purchase up to $1 billion in the aggregate of the company's outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock. the manner, timing, number and share price of any repurchases will be determined by the company at its discretion and will depend upon such factors as the market price of the stock, general market conditions, applicable securities laws, alternative investment opportunities and other factors. the repurchase program has no time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. as of june 30, 2023, the remaining authorized amount under the repurchase program was approximately $577 million.
stock repurchases under the repurchase program commenced on november 9, 2021. during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023, the company repurchased and subsequently retired 9.5 million shares of class a common stock for approximately $159 million and 4.7 million shares of class b common stock for approximately $81 million. during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, the company repurchased and subsequently retired 5.8 million shares of class a common stock for approximately $122 million and 2.9 million shares of class b common stock for approximately $61 million.

cash dividends paid per share         $0.20                         $0.20
the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders, if any, is within the discretion of the board of directors. the board of directors' decisions regarding the payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including the company's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.

reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow available to news corporation free cash flow and free cash flow available to news corporation are non-gaap financial measures. free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, and free cash flow available to news corporation is defined as free cash flow, less rea group free cash flow, plus cash dividends received from rea group. free cash flow and free cash flow available to news corporation should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, cash flows from operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap. free cash flow and free cash flow available to news corporation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow.
the company believes free cash flow provides useful information to management and investors about the company's liquidity and cash flow trends. the company believes free cash flow available to news corporation, which adjusts free cash flow to exclude rea group's free cash flow and include dividends received from rea group, provides management and investors with a measure of the amount of cash flow that is readily available to the company, as rea group is a separately listed public company in australia and must declare a dividend in order for the company to have access to its share of rea group's cash balance. the company believes free cash flow available to news corporation provides a more conservative view of the company's free cash flow because this presentation includes only that amount of cash the company actually receives from rea group, which has generally been lower than the company's unadjusted free cash flow.
a limitation of both free cash flow and free cash flow available to news corporation is that they do not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow and free cash flow available to news corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap which incorporate all cash movements during the period.

________________________

(a)the company has commitments under purchase obligations related to minimum subscriber guarantees for license fees, printing contracts, capital projects, marketing agreements, production services and other legally binding commitments.
(b)the company has sports programming rights commitments with the national rugby league, australian football league and cricket australia, as well as certain other broadcast rights, which are payable through fiscal 2032.
(c)the company has programming rights commitments with various suppliers for programming content.
(d)the company leases office facilities, warehouse facilities, printing plants, satellite services and equipment. these leases, which are classified as operating leases, are expected to be paid at certain dates through fiscal 2048. amounts reflected represent only the company's lease obligations for which it has firm commitments.
(e)the company has contractual commitments for satellite transmission services. the company's satellite transponder services arrangements extend through fiscal 2032 and are accounted for as operating or finance leases, based on the underlying terms of those arrangements.
(f)see note 9-borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
(g)reflects the company's expected future interest payments based on borrowings outstanding and interest rates applicable at june 30, 2023. such rates are subject to change in future periods. see note 9-borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
the company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint, ink and plates that require the company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements for production. since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the company's total requirements, the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above.
the table also excludes the company's pension obligations, other postretirement benefits ("opeb") obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments. the company made contributions of $14 million and $29 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, interest rates and statutory requirements. the company anticipates that it will make required contributions of approximately $23 million in fiscal 2024, assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company's returns in fiscal 2023 and those expected beyond, and that interest rates remain constant. the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. payments due to participants under the company's pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts. payments due under the company's opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the company's opeb plans. the company expects its opeb payments to approximate $7 million in fiscal 2024. see note 17-retirement benefit obligations and note 18-other postretirement benefits in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
other significant ongoing expenses or cash requirements for each of the company's segments are discussed above in "overview of the company's businesses." the company generally expects to fund these short and long-term cash requirements with internally-generated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand.
contingencies the company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations, including those discussed in note 16-commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. the outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty, and the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters. fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.
the company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. the amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred. the company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable. see note 16-commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
the company's tax returns are subject to on-going review and examination by various tax authorities. tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the company's tax returns, and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable. the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax table of contents matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid. however, these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress, or as settlements or litigations occur.
critical accounting policies and estimates an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company's financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company. see note 2-summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets the company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value. the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments. indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired.
under asc 350, in assessing goodwill for impairment, the company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. however, if the company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting unit, and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit primarily by using both a discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation approach.
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, long-term growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, as part of the company's long-range planning process, the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test.
the performance of the company's annual impairment analysis resulted in $25 million of impairments to indefinite-lived intangible assets and no write-downs of goodwill in fiscal 2023. significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates (ranging from 8.5% to 18.0%), long-term growth rates (ranging from 1.0% to 3.5%) and royalty rates (ranging from 0.25% to 7.0%). significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums (ranging from 5.0% to 10.0%). significant increases (decreases) in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, assuming no change in discount rates, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. significant decreases (increases) in discount rates, assuming no changes in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. see note 8-goodwill and other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details regarding changes in these inputs and assumptions compared to prior fiscal years.
as of june 30, 2023, there were no reporting units with goodwill at-risk for future impairment. the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible future impairment.
programming costs costs incurred in acquiring programming rights are accounted for in accordance with asc 920, "entertainment-broadcasters." programming rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing. programming costs are amortized based on the expected pattern of consumption over the license period or expected useful life of each program, which requires significant judgment. the pattern of consumption is based primarily on consumer viewership information as well as other factors. if initial airings are expected to generate higher viewership, an accelerated method of amortization is used. the company monitors its programming amortization policy on an ongoing basis and any impact arising from changes to the policy would be table of contents recognized prospectively. the company regularly reviews its programming assets to ensure they continue to reflect fair value. changes in circumstances may result in a write-down of the asset to fair value. the company has single and multi-year contracts for broadcast rights of sporting events. the costs of sports contracts are primarily charged to expense over the respective season as events are aired. for sports contracts with dedicated channels, the company amortizes the sports programming rights costs over 12 months.
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the company's tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740, "income taxes."
the company's annual tax rate is based primarily on its geographic income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. significant management judgment is required in determining the company's provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company's net deferred tax assets, if any. in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets, management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. the company's actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, tax planning and the company's forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods. although the company believes its current estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. management re-evaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available. the company's policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of income tax (expense) benefit.
see note 19-income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details regarding these estimates and assumptions and changes compared to prior fiscal years.
retirement benefit obligations the company's employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the company and its subsidiaries. see note 17-retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
the company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by gaap. the measurement and recognition of the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality and other actuarial assumptions. net periodic benefit costs (income) are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations, an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality rates. current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, were considered in making these assumptions. in developing the expected long-term rate of return, the pension portfolio's past average rate of returns and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered. the weighted average expected long-term rate of return of 5.6% for fiscal 2024 is based on a weighted average target asset allocation assumption of 16% equities, 74% fixed-income securities and 10% cash and other investments.
the company recorded $13 million and nil in net periodic benefit costs (income) in the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the company utilizes the full yield-curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs (income) for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
although the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually, a weighted average discount rate of 5.4% will be used in calculating the fiscal 2024 net periodic benefit costs (income). the discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on the company's annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal table of contents year. the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. the rate was determined by matching the company's expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred high-quality non-callable corporate bonds. the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the u.s., the u.k., australia and other foreign countries as of the measurement date.
the key assumptions used in developing the company's fiscal 2023 and 2022 net periodic benefit costs (income) for its plans consist of the following:
2023                                                                                                                            2022

the company will use a weighted average long-term rate of return of 5.6% for fiscal 2024 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and an expectation of future long term investment returns. the accumulated net pre-tax losses on the company's pension plans as of june 30, 2023 were approximately $467 million which increased from approximately $458 million for the company's pension plans as of june 30, 2022. this net increase of $9 million was primarily due to losses on plan assets, which were largely offset by actuarial gains due to higher discount rates. lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company's deferred losses and also increase subsequent-year benefit costs. higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company's accumulated net loss and decrease subsequent-year benefit costs. these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs (income) in accordance with asc 715, "compensation-retirement benefits." unrecognized losses for the primary plans in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants for the primary plans.
the company made contributions of $14 million and $29 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and interest rate movements. assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company's expected returns in fiscal 2023 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the company anticipates that it will make required pension contributions of approximately $23 million in fiscal 2024. the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. see note 17-retirement benefit obligations and note 18-other postretirement benefits in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the company's expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company's pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant:

overview we are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the united states, puerto rico, and mexico. we are one of the largest u.s. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both diy customers and professional service providers - our "dual market strategy." our goal is to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages, such as our dual market strategy, superior customer service provided by well-trained and technically proficient team members, and strategic distribution and hub store network that provides same day and over-night inventory access for our stores to offer a broad selection of product offerings. the successful execution of our growth strategy includes aggressively opening new stores, growing sales in existing stores, continually enhancing merchandising and store layouts, and implementing our omnichannel initiatives. as of december 31, 2023, we operated 6,095 stores in 48 u.s. states and puerto rico and 62 stores in mexico.
the extensive product line offered in our stores consists of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools, and professional service provider service equipment. our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. for many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects "good," "better," and "best" alternatives. our sales and total gross profit dollars are, generally, highest for the "best" quality category of products. consumers' willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of enhanced sales and profitability in our industry. we have ongoing initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, as well as "purchasing up" on the value spectrum.
our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter, and battery recycling; battery, wiper, and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops.
our business is influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors that impact both our industry and consumers, including, but not limited to, inflation, including rising consumer staples; fuel and energy costs; unemployment trends; interest rates; and other economic factors. future changes, such as continued broad-based inflation and rapid fuel cost increases that exceed wage growth, may negatively impact our consumers' level of disposable income, and we cannot predict the degree these changes, or other future changes, may have on our business or industry.
we believe the key drivers of demand over the long-term for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of u.s. miles driven, number of u.s. registered vehicles, annual rate of light vehicle sales, and average vehicle age.
number of miles driven the number of total miles driven in the u.s. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. in total, vehicles in the u.s. are driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation. according to the u.s. department of transportation, the number of total miles driven in the u.s. decreased 13.2% in 2020, as a result of responses to the coronavirus pandemic, including work from home arrangements and reduced travel. miles driven improved and increased 11.2% in 2021, and continued to improve and increased 0.9% in 2022, and in 2023, returned to more typical levels with an increase of 2.1%. total miles driven can be impacted by macroeconomic factors, including rapid increases in fuel cost, but we are unable to predict the degree of impact these factors may have on miles driven in the future.
29
size and age of the vehicle fleet the total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. as reported by the auto care association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 13.9% from 2012 to 2022, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 283 million by the end of 2022. for the year ended december 31, 2023, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the u.s. ("saar") was approximately 15.8 million vehicles, contributing to the continued growth in the total number of registered vehicles on the road. from 2012 to 2022, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from 4.1% to 5.7% annually. as a result, over the past decade, the average age of the u.s. vehicle population has increased, growing 9.9%, from 11.1 years in 2012 to 12.2 years in 2022. while the annual changes to the vehicle population resulting from new vehicle sales and the fluctuation in vehicle scrappage rates in any given year represent a small percentage of the total light vehicle population and have a muted impact on the total number and average age of vehicles on the road over the short term, we believe our business benefits from the current environment of elevated new and used vehicle prices, as consumers are more willing to continue to invest in their current vehicle.
we believe the increase in average vehicle age over the long term can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains, interiors and exteriors, coupled with consumers' willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles. as the average age of vehicles on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty. these out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures, and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. we believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles, and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.
inflationary cost pressures impact our business; however, historically we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases, principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases, and selective forward buying. to the extent our acquisition costs increase due to base commodity price increases or other input cost increases affecting the entire industry, we have typically been able to pass along these cost increases through higher selling prices for the affected products. as a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.
we remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o'reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service.

2023 compared to 2022
sales:
sales for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased $1.40 billion, or 10%, to $15.81 billion from $14.41 billion for the same period in 2022. comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 7.9% and 6.4% for the year ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. comparable store sales are calculated based on changes in sales for u.s. stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, and sales to team members. online sales, resulting from ship-to-home orders and pickup in-store orders for u.s. stores open at least one year are included in the comparable store sales calculation. we opened 186 and 187 net, new stores during the year ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we anticipate new store growth will be 190 to 200 net, new store openings in 2024.
the increase in sales for the year ended december 31, 2023, was primarily the result of the 7.9% increase in domestic comparable store sales and a $293 million increase in sales from new stores opened in 2022 and 2023 that are not considered comparable stores. our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31, 2023, was driven by an increase in average ticket value for both professional service provider and diy customers and positive transaction counts from professional service provider customers, partially offset by negative transaction counts from diy customers. average ticket values benefited from inflationary increases in average selling prices, as compared to the same period in 2022. average ticket values also continue to be positively impacted by the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles. these better-engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time. the resulting decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values. the increase in professional service provider customer transaction counts was driven by consistently exceptional execution of
32
our strategies surrounding superior service, inventory availability, and competitive pricing. the decrease in diy customer transaction counts was driven by the broader industry dynamics of better engineered parts, which last longer but result in reduced repair frequency.
see note 12 "revenue" to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the company's sales.
gross profit:
gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased 10% to $8.10 billion (or 51.3% of sales) from $7.38 billion (or 51.2% of sales) for the same period in 2022. the increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended december 31, 2023, was primarily the result of new store sales and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores. the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31, 2023, was due to improved acquisition costs, partially offset by the impact from the rollout of our professional pricing initiative in the first quarter of 2022, which was a strategic investment aimed at ensuring we are more competitively priced on the professional side of our business; a greater percentage of our total sales mix generated from professional service provider customers, which carry a lower gross margin than diy sales; and a greater benefit in the prior year from selling through inventory purchased prior to recent acquisition cost increases and corresponding selling price increases.
selling, general and administrative expenses:
selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased 11% to $4.92 billion (or 31.1% of sales) from $4.43 billion (or 30.7% of sales) for the same period in 2022. the increase in total sg&a dollars for the year ended december 31, 2023, was the result of additional team members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count. the increase in sg&a as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31, 2023, was primarily the result of increased store staffing, wage rates, and enhanced benefits to support superior service levels, depreciation costs on accelerated refreshment of store delivery vehicle fleet, investment initiatives aimed at refreshing the image and appearance of our stores, increased expense for the market value performance of the company's deferred compensation plan, increased cost for self-insured auto liability exposure, which was driven by inflation in claim costs, and the costs associated with the resumption of our annual in-person leadership conference. see note 13 "share-based compensation and benefit plans" to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the company's deferred compensation plan.
operating income:
as a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased 8% to $3.19 billion (or 20.2% of sales) from $2.95 billion (or 20.5% of sales) for the same period in 2022.
other income and expense:
total other expense for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased 17% to $182 million (or 1.1% of sales), from $156 million (or 1.1% of sales) for the same period in 2022. the increase in total other expense for the year ended december 31, 2023, was the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings, partially offset by an increase in the value of our trading securities, as compared to a decrease in the same period in 2022. see note 8 "financing" to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the company's borrowings. see note 2 "fair value measurements" to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the company's trading securities.
income taxes:
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased 5% to $658 million (21.9% effective tax rate) from $626 million (22.4% effective tax rate) for the same period in 2022. the increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2023, was the result of higher taxable income, partially offset by higher excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily was the result of higher excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. see note 16 "income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the company's income taxes.
net income:
as a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased to $2.35 billion (or 14.8% of sales), from $2.17 billion (or 15.1% of sales) for the same period in 2022.
earnings per share:
our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased 15% to $38.47 on 61 million shares from $33.44 on 65 million shares for the same period in 2022.

2022 compared to 2021
a discussion of the changes in our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, has been omitted from this form 10-k but may be found in item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, filed with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") on february 28, 2023, which is available free of charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov by searching with our ticker symbol "orly" or at our internet address, www.oreillyauto.com, by clicking "investor relations" located at the bottom of the page.
liquidity and capital resources our long-term business strategy requires capital to maintain and enhance our existing stores, invest to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, develop enhanced information technology systems and tools, and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our board-approved share repurchase program. our material cash requirements necessary to maintain the current operations of our long-term business strategy include, but are not limited to, inventory purchases; human capital obligations, including payroll and benefits; contractual obligations, including debt and interest obligations; capital expenditures; payment of income taxes; and other operational priorities. we expect to fund our short- and long-term cash and capital requirements with our primary sources of liquidity, which include funds generated from the normal course of our business operations, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program, and senior note offerings. however, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows or maintain liquidity at or above recent levels, as we are unable to predict decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns. additionally, these factors could also impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
our material contractual cash obligations as of december 31, 2023, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements and interest payments related to long-term debt, future minimum payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, projected obligations related to future payments under the company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, uncertain tax positions and associated estimated interest and penalties, payments for certain deferred income taxes, the obligation to purchase renewable energy tax credits, and commitments for the purchase of inventory. we expect to fund these various commitments and obligations primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. see note 5 "leases," note 13 "share-based compensation and benefit plans," note 14 "commitments," and note 16 "income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our leasing arrangements, share-based compensation payments, construction commitments, and uncertain tax positions, respectively, which are not reflected in the table below.
the following table identifies the estimated payments for each of the next five years, and in the aggregate thereafter, of the company's debt instruments and related interest payments and self-insurance reserves as of december 31, 2023 (in thousands):

due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment's cancellation terms, the timing of payments for certain deferred income taxes, uncertain tax positions, and commitments related to future payments under the company's nonqualified compensation plan cannot be determined and are therefore excluded from the above table, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2024, which are included in "current liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheets.

off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity, for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" for more information on our variable interest entities. we issue stand-by letters of credit, for more information see note 8 "financing" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our stand-by letters of credit.
we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current, or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

cash and cash equivalents balances held outside of the u.s. were $3.3 million and $11.1 million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which was generally utilized to support the liquidity needs of foreign operations in mexico.
operating activities:
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to an increase in net inventory investment, compared to a decrease in 2022, partially offset by an increase in operating income and the timing of payment for transferrable federal renewable energy tax credits.
investing activities:
the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in equity tax credit investments. the increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to an increase in store and distribution enhancement and expansion projects, as well as an increase in vehicle fleet upgrade investments, in 2023 versus 2022.
we opened 186 and 187 net, new stores in 2023 and 2022, respectively. we plan to open 190 to 200 net, new stores in 2024. the costs associated with the expected openings of owned store locations in 2024, including the cost of land acquisition, building construction, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment, and computer equipment, are estimated to average approximately $3.0 million to $3.3 million per store; however, such costs may be significantly lower where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site and higher where we build a hub, as they require a larger inventory investment and are generally larger in size.
financing activities:
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily attributable to larger net borrowings in 2023 and a lower level of repurchases of our common stock in 2023.
2022 compared to 2021:

"management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, filed with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") on february 28, 2023, which is available free of charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov by searching with our ticker symbol "orly" or at our internet address, www.oreillyauto.com, by clicking "investor relations" located at the bottom of the page.

debt instruments:
see note 8 "financing" to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the company's credit agreement, unsecured revolving credit facility, outstanding letters of credit, commercial paper program, and unsecured senior notes.
debt covenants:
the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and limit our ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. these covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes.
the credit agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50:1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50:1.00. the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent, and non-cash share-based compensation expense to fixed charges. fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, and rent expense. the consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent, and non-cash share-based compensation expense. adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, and five-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. in the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the credit agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the credit agreement, and litigation from our lenders.
we had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 6.42 times and 6.71 times as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.93 times and 1.73 times as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements.

free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and the consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). we do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, gaap financial information. we believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the credit agreement. we include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-gaap information is useful to investors as

well. material limitations of these non-gaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts. we compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures.
share repurchase program:
see note 10 "share repurchase program" to the consolidated financial statements for information on our share repurchase program.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates. management continues to review these critical accounting estimates and assumptions to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap. however, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.
self-insurance reserves:
we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and team member health care benefits. with the exception of certain team member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation, and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, or property loss claim.
when estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns, and exposure forecasts. the assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. certain of the self-insurance liabilities are determined at an estimate of their net present value, using the u.s. treasury risk-free rate. our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply a significant amount of subjective judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to resolve reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date. the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. management believes the assumptions developed and used to determine the estimate for our self-insurance reserve are reasonable. actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains.
as we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. these liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. we could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities.
our self-insurance reserve estimate included on our consolidated balance sheets decreased $19 million from 2022 to 2023, which is primarily due to having resolved and paid out older, higher-than-expected self-insured auto liability claims, partially offset by our growing operations, inflation, increases in healthcare costs, the number of vehicles, and the number of hours worked, as well as our historical claims experience. if the underlying assumptions in management's estimate changed self-insurance reserves by 10% from our estimated reserves at december 31, 2023, the financial impact would have been approximately $21 million or 0.7% of pretax income for the year ended december 31, 2023. see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.
valuation of long-lived assets:
we evaluate the carrying value of finite and indefinite long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. as a component of the finite long-lived assets evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with indicators of impairment that should be considered for impairment. a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset group are less than the carrying value of the asset group. the estimate of cash flows includes management's assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset group in operations. if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset groups.
38
as a component of the indefinite long-lived assets evaluation, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine if events or circumstances that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset have occurred, as well as if they continue to support an indefinite useful life. areas evaluated include changes in cost factors such as raw materials or labor, financial performance including declining revenues or cash flows, the legal, regulatory, and political environment, and other industry and market considerations, including the competitive environment and changes in product demand. if events or market conditions exist that would more likely than not indicate that impairment may be necessary, a detailed quantitative assessment would be performed.
based on our qualitative assessment, we do not believe there has been a change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a calculation of fair value of indefinite long-lived assets is required as of december 31, 2023. our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. see note 6 "goodwill and other intangibles" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our finite and indefinite long-lived assets.

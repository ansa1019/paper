item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an energy company committed to being the leader in providing infrastructure that safely delivers natural gas products to reliably fuel the clean energy economy. our operations are located in the united states.
our interstate natural gas pipeline strategy is to create value by maximizing the utilization of our pipeline capacity by providing high-quality, low-cost transportation of natural gas to large and growing markets. our gas pipeline businesses' interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to regulation by the ferc and as such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and the extension, expansion or abandonment of jurisdictional facilities and accounting, among other things, are subject to regulation. the rates are established primarily through the ferc's ratemaking process, but we also may negotiate rates with our customers pursuant to the terms of our tariffs and ferc policy. changes in commodity prices and volumes transported have limited near-term impact on these revenues because the majority of cost of service is recovered through firm capacity reservation charges in transportation rates.
the ongoing strategy of our midstream operations is to safely and reliably operate large-scale midstream infrastructure where our assets can be fully utilized and drive low per-unit costs. we focus on consistently attracting new business by providing highly reliable service to our customers. these services include natural gas gathering, processing, treating, compression and storage, ngl fractionation, transportation and storage, crude oil production handling and transportation, as well as marketing services for ngl, crude oil, and natural gas.
consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources, our operations are conducted, managed, and presented within the following reportable segments: transmission & gulf of mexico, northeast g&p, west, and gas & ngl marketing services. all remaining business activities, including our upstream operations and corporate activities, are included in other. our reportable segments are comprised of the following business activities:

sale of certain gulf coast liquids pipelines on september 29, 2023, we completed the sale of various petrochemical and feedstock pipelines and associated contracts in the gulf coast region for $348 million. as a result of this sale, we recorded a gain of $129 million in 2023 in our transmission & gulf of mexico segment.
mountainwest acquisition on february 14, 2023, we closed on the acquisition of 100 percent of mountainwest pipelines holding company which includes ferc-regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and natural gas storage capacity, for $1.08 billion of cash, funded with available sources of short-term liquidity, and retaining $430 million outstanding principal amount of mountainwest long-term debt. the mountainwest acquisition expands our existing transmission and storage infrastructure footprint into major markets in utah, wyoming, and colorado. this business is reported within the transmission & gulf of mexico segment.
favorable judgment against energy transfer we have been involved in litigation since 2016 in delaware chancery court with energy transfer equity, l.p. (energy transfer) related to the agreement and plan of merger with energy transfer, dated as of september 28, 2015. on december 29, 2021, the court entered judgment in our favor in the amount of $410 million, plus interest at the contractual rate, and our reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. on september 21, 2022, the delaware chancery court entered a final order and judgment awarding us a termination fee, attorney's fees, expenses, and interest in the amount of $602 million plus additional interest starting september 17, 2022. energy transfer appealed to the delaware supreme court. the delaware supreme court held oral argument en banc on july 12, 2023. on october 10, 2023, the delaware supreme court issued an opinion affirming the delaware chancery court ruling. on october 25, 2023, energy transfer filed a motion for reargument with the delaware supreme court, which was denied.
on november 28, 2023, we received a $627 million payment from energy transfer for the final order and judgment. on the same day, we paid attorney fees which had been incurred on a contingent fee basis. this resulted in a net gain of $534 million reported as net gain from energy transfer litigation judgment in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2023 (see note 17 - contingencies and commitments).
northwest pipeline ferc rate case settlement on november 15, 2022, northwest pipeline received approval from the ferc for a stipulation and settlement agreement which generally reduces rates effective january 1, 2023, resolves other rate issues, establishes a modernization and emission reduction program, and satisfies its rate case filing obligation. provisions were included in the settlement that establish a moratorium on any proceedings that would seek to place new rates in effect any earlier than january 1, 2026, and that a general rate case filing will be made for rates to become effective not later than april 1, 2028, unless we have entered into a pre-filing settlement prior to that date.
company outlook our strategy is to provide a large-scale, reliable, and clean energy infrastructure designed to maximize the opportunities created by the vast supply of natural gas and natural gas products that exists in the united states. we accomplish this by connecting the growing demand for cleaner fuels and feedstocks with our major positions in the premier natural gas and natural gas products supply basins. we continue to maintain a strong commitment to safety, environmental stewardship including seeking opportunities for renewable energy ventures, operational excellence, and customer satisfaction. we believe that accomplishing these goals will position us to deliver safe, reliable, clean energy services to our customers and an attractive return to our shareholders. our business plan for 2024 includes a continued focus on earnings and cash flow growth.
in 2024, our operating results are expected to benefit from the recent gulf coast storage and dj basin acquisitions. we also anticipate increases resulting from transmission & gulf of mexico expansion projects, including the regional energy access project, and annual inflation-based rate increases across our gathering and processing business. these increases are partially offset by lower expected gas & ngl marketing services results, the absence of realized hedge gains captured in 2023, and a decrease in expected volumes in the appalachian basin associated with a lower expected commodity price environment.
we seek to maintain a strong financial position and liquidity, as well as manage a diversified portfolio of safe, clean, and reliable energy infrastructure assets that continue to serve key growth markets and supply basins in the united states. our growth capital and investment expenditures in 2024 are expected to be in a range from $1.45 billion to $1.75 billion, excluding acquisitions. growth capital spending in 2024 primarily includes transco expansions, all of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements, projects supporting growth in the haynesville basin, and projects supporting the northeast g&p business. we also expect to invest capital in our other segment ventures. in addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that reduce emissions, and meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments.
potential risks and obstacles that could impact the execution of our plan include:
•a global recession, which could result in downturns in financial markets and commodity prices, as well as impact demand for natural gas and related products;
•opposition to, and regulations affecting, our infrastructure projects, including the risk of delay or denial in permits and approvals needed for our projects;
•counterparty credit and performance risk;
•unexpected significant increases in capital expenditures or delays in capital project execution, including increases from inflation or delays caused by supply chain disruptions;
•unexpected changes in customer drilling and production activities, which could negatively impact gathering and processing volumes;
•lower than anticipated demand for natural gas and natural gas products which could result in lower-than-expected volumes, energy commodity prices, and margins;
•general economic, financial markets, or industry downturns, including increased inflation and interest rates;
•physical damages to facilities, including damage to offshore facilities by weather-related events;
•other risks set forth under part i, item 1a. risk factors in this report.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. we believe that the nature of these estimates and assumptions is material due to the subjectivity and judgment necessary, or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of these on our financial condition or results of operations.
pension and postretirement obligations we have pension and other postretirement benefit plans that require the use of assumptions and estimates to determine the benefit obligations and costs. these estimates and assumptions involve significant judgment and actual results will likely be different than anticipated. estimates and assumptions utilized include the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, cash balance interest crediting rate, and employee demographics, including retirement age and mortality. these assumptions are reviewed annually and adjustments are made as needed. the assumptions utilized to compute the benefit obligations and costs are shown in note 7 - employee benefit plans.
the following table presents the estimated increase (decrease) in net periodic benefit cost and obligations resulting from a one-percentage-point change in the specific assumption.

our expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, as determined at the beginning of each fiscal year, are based on historical returns, forward-looking capital market expectations of at least 10 years from our third-party independent investment advisor, as well as the investment strategy and relative weightings of the asset classes within the investment portfolio. our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used for our pension plans was 5.17 percent in 2023. the 2023 actual return on plan assets for our pension plans was approximately 11.4 percent. the 10-year average rate of return on pension plan assets through december 2023 was approximately 6.4 percent. the expected rates of return on plan assets are long-term in nature and are not significantly impacted by short-term market performance.
the discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined separately based on an approach specific to our plans, which considers a yield curve of high-quality corporate bonds and the duration of the expected benefit cash flows of each plan.
the cash balance interest crediting rate assumption represents the average long-term rate by which the pension plans' cash balance accounts are expected to grow. interest on the cash balance accounts is based on the 30-year u.s. treasury securities rate.

2023 vs. 2022
service revenues increased primarily due to:
•higher volumes from acquisitions at our transmission & gulf of mexico segment;
•higher volumes and rates at our northeast g&p segment; partially offset by
•lower rates, partially offset by higher volumes at our west segment.
the net sum of service revenues - commodity consideration, product sales, product costs, net realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives related to sales of product, and net realized processing commodity expenses for our reportable segments (excludes other) comprise our commodity margins. product sales and net realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives at our other segment, which reflect sales related to our upstream operations, comprise net realized product sales.
service revenues - commodity consideration, which represent payments we receive in the form of commodities for processing services provided, decreased primarily due to lower ngl prices. most of these ngl volumes are sold during the month processed and are offset within product costs below.
the product sales decrease primarily consists of:
•lower marketing sales activities at our gas & ngl marketing services segment;
•lower sales from upstream operations within other;
•lower equity ngl sales prices primarily at our west and transmission & gulf of mexico segments;
•lower system management gas sales primarily at our west and transmission & gulf of mexico segments.
as we are acting as agent for natural gas marketing customers, our natural gas marketing product sales are presented net of the related costs of those activities within our gas & ngl marketing services segment.
net gain (loss) from commodity derivatives includes realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments reflected within total revenues primarily in our gas & ngl marketing services, west, and other segments (see note 16 - commodity derivatives).
we experience significant earnings volatility from the fair value accounting required for the derivatives used to hedge a portion of the economic value of the underlying transportation and storage portfolio as well as upstream-related production. however, the unrealized fair value measurement gains and losses are generally offset by valuation changes in the economic value of the underlying production or transportation and storage contracts, which is not recognized until the underlying transaction occurs.
the product costs decrease primarily consists of:
•lower marketing activities at our gas & ngl marketing services segment;
•lower costs associated with ngls acquired as commodity consideration related to our equity ngl production activities;
•lower system management gas purchases primarily at our west and transmission & gulf of mexico segments.
net processing commodity expenses increased primarily due to:
•unfavorable change in unrealized gains and losses from commodity derivatives related to processing plant shrink gas purchases (see note 16 - commodity derivatives);
•partially offset by lower natural gas purchases due to lower prices associated with our equity ngl production activities primarily at our west and transmission & gulf of mexico segments.
operating and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to higher operating costs, including increased costs associated with the february 2023 mountainwest acquisition, the april 2022 trace acquisition, and the august 2022 nortex asset purchase, and increased scope and timing of operating and maintenance activities.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily related to our upstream assets, and assets acquired in the february 2023 mountainwest acquisition, the april 2022 trace acquisition, and the august 2022 nortex asset purchase. the increase is partially offset by lower amortization of intangibles related to our 2021 sequent acquisition.
selling, general, and administrative expenses increased primarily due to acquisition and transition-related costs associated with the mountainwest acquisition.
gain on sale of business resulted from our sale of certain liquids pipelines in the gulf coast region (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures).
other (income) expense - net within operating income (loss) changed favorably primarily due to:
•a favorable change associated with regulatory liabilities established for the impacts of deferred income taxes at northwest pipeline and the absence of 2022 regulatory charges associated with a decrease in transco's estimated deferred state income tax rate;
•the absence of a 2022 loss related to eminence storage cavern abandonments;
•a 2023 gain related to a contract settlement.
equity earnings (losses) changed unfavorably primarily due to a decrease at laurel mountain and our share of a loss contingency accrual related to our 14 percent ownership in aux sable liquid products lp, partially offset by increases at blue racer and oppl.
the favorable change in other investing income (loss) - net includes higher interest income earned on higher cash and cash equivalent balances, and a gain on remeasuring our existing equity-method investment in rmm to fair value with the acquisition of the remaining 50 percent ownership (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures).
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to our 2023 debt issuances and mountainwest's long-term debt (see note 12 - debt and banking arrangements), partially offset by an increase in interest capitalized related to ongoing expansion projects.
the net gain from energy transfer litigation judgment resulted from a favorable ruling on the final order and judgment of our complaint against energy transfer (see note 17 - contingencies and commitments).
the favorable change in other income (expense) - net below operating income (loss) includes an increase in equity allowance for funds used during construction (equity afudc) at our transmission & gulf of mexico segment and the related effects of deferred taxes within other.
provision (benefit) for income taxes changed unfavorably primarily due to higher pre-tax income, the absence of a benefit related to the release of valuation allowances on deferred income tax assets in 2022, a lower benefit associated with decreases in our estimate of the state deferred income tax rate in both periods, and the absence of 2022 federal income tax settlements. see note 6 - provision (benefit) for income taxes for a discussion of the effective tax rate compared to the federal statutory rate for both periods.
income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2023 includes a pre-tax charge of $125 million to increase the related accrued liability associated with our alaska refinery contamination litigation, partially offset by the related income tax effect (see note 17 - contingencies and commitments).
the unfavorable change in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily due to higher results at cardinal and the northeast jv.
2022 vs. 2021
service revenues increased primarily due to higher gathering and processing rates driven by favorable commodity prices and annual contractual rate escalations for certain of our west and northeast g&p operations, higher volumes including from the trace acquisition and nortex asset purchase, higher transportation fee revenues associated with the leidy south expansion project placed fully in service at transco in december 2021, and higher reimbursable electric power costs and storage rates which are substantially offset in operating and maintenance expenses.
service revenues - commodity consideration increased primarily due to higher ngl prices, partially offset by lower ngl volumes. these revenues represent consideration we receive in the form of commodities as full or partial payment for processing services provided. most of these ngl volumes are sold during the month processed and therefore are offset within product costs below.
product sales increased primarily due to higher marketing sales prices and volumes, including increased volumes associated with the sequent acquisition in third-quarter 2021 and the trace acquisition in second-quarter 2022. product sales also increased due to higher sales volumes and prices associated with our upstream operations and system management gas sales, as well as higher prices and lower volumes related to our equity ngl sales activities. these increases were partially offset by an unfavorable change in natural gas marketing sales primarily due to the impact of netting the 2022 legacy natural gas marketing revenues with the associated costs (see note 1 - general, description of business, basis of presentation, and summary of significant accounting policies). as we are acting as agent for natural gas marketing customers of our gas & ngl marketing services segment, our natural gas marketing product sales are presented net of the related costs of those activities, including significant 2022 lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments to our natural gas inventory.
the unfavorable change in net gain (loss) from commodity derivatives primarily reflects higher net unrealized losses in our gas & ngl marketing services segment, and higher net realized losses related to derivative contracts in our other segment. lower net realized losses at our west segment and a net unrealized gain at our other segment in 2022 partially offset these impacts.
product costs decreased primarily due to the impact of netting the 2022 legacy natural gas marketing revenues with the associated costs. this decrease was partially offset by higher prices and volumes associated with our ngl marketing activities, including the increase in volumes associated with the trace acquisition in second-quarter 2022, as well as significant 2022 lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments to our ngl inventory. product costs also increased due to higher system management gas purchases and higher ngl prices associated with volumes acquired as commodity consideration related to our equity ngl production activities.
net processing commodity expenses decreased primarily due to the impact of a 2022 net unrealized gain from derivatives for processing plant shrink gas purchases and lower volumes for natural gas purchases associated with our equity ngl production activities, partially offset by higher net realized prices.
operating and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs, including $63 million of higher reimbursable electric power and storage costs which are substantially offset in service revenues. the increase was also a result of higher expenses associated with our upstream operations, increased costs associated with transco's leidy south expansion project placed in service in december 2021, higher employee-related expenses, and higher expenses associated with the 2022 trace acquisition and nortex asset purchase.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to amortization of intangibles acquired in the sequent and trace acquisitions and an increase in depreciation at transco related to aro revisions (offset in other (income) expense - net within operating income (loss) resulting in no net impact on our results of operations), partially offset by the absence of 2021 depreciation on certain decommissioned facilities in our west segment.
selling, general, and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher employee-related expenses driven by the sequent acquisition in july 2021 and higher expenses for various corporate costs, including technology costs to support efforts to track and quantify emissions associated with natural gas procurement, transmission, and delivery.
other (income) expense - net within operating income (loss) changed unfavorably primarily due to charges related to eminence storage cavern abandonments and monitoring, as well as regulatory charges associated with a decrease in transco's estimated deferred state income tax rate, offset by the deferral of aro depreciation (offset in depreciation and amortization expenses resulting in no net impact on our results of operations).
equity earnings (losses) changed favorably primarily due to increases at investments across our west segment, including rmm, and at laurel mountain, partially offset by a decrease at appalachia midstream investments.
provision (benefit) for income taxes changed favorably primarily due to a benefit associated with a decrease in our estimate of the state deferred income tax rate, a benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance, and federal settlements, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. see note 6 - provision (benefit) for income taxes for a discussion of the effective tax rate compared to the federal statutory rate for both periods.
the unfavorable change in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily due to higher results at the northeast jv.
year-over-year operating results - segments we evaluate segment operating performance based upon modified ebitda. note 18 - segment disclosures includes a reconciliation of this non-gaap measure to net income (loss). management uses modified ebitda because it is an accepted financial indicator used by investors to compare company performance. in addition, management believes that this measure provides investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of our assets. modified ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with gaap.

_______________
(1)included as a component of commodity margins.
2023 vs. 2022
transmission & gulf of mexico modified ebitda increased primarily due to higher service revenues and a gain on sale of business.
service revenues increased primarily due to:
•a $222 million increase due to the acquisition of mountainwest primarily in transportation and storage revenues;
•a $42 million increase due to the nortex asset purchase primarily in storage and transportation revenues;
•a $30 million increase in the eastern gulf coast region primarily due to higher production handling volumes from new wells at devils tower, partially offset by lower volumes from the norphlet pipeline due to natural decline;
•a $15 million increase in transco's revenues associated with the regional energy access expansion project placed partially in-service in the fourth quarter of 2023;
•a $12 million increase in transco's and northwest pipeline's revenues associated with short-term firm transportation; partially offset by
•a $19 million decrease due to lower rates from the ferc rate case settlement effective january 1, 2023, at northwest pipeline;
•a $14 million decrease in reimbursable electric power costs and storage rates, offset by similar changes in electricity charges and storage costs, reflected in other segment costs and expenses;
•a $10 million decrease due to the sale of certain liquids pipelines in the gulf coast region in september 2023 primarily in transportation revenues (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures).
commodity margins decreased primarily due to a $15 million decrease from our equity ngls, driven by unfavorable net realized pricing for equity ngl sales, partially offset by lower prices for natural gas purchases associated with our equity ngl production activities.
other segment costs and expenses increased primarily due to:
•higher operating and administrative costs including higher operating, acquisition, and transition costs related to our mountainwest acquisition and nortex asset purchase; and higher costs related to timing and scope of general maintenance activities primarily at transco, partially offset by lower reimbursable electric power costs and storage costs, which are offset by a similar change in electricity reimbursements and storage revenues reflected in service revenues; and lower employee-related costs;
•higher project feasibility costs; partially offset by
•favorable changes associated with regulatory liabilities established for the impacts of deferred income taxes at northwest pipeline associated with the ferc rate case settlement mentioned above in service revenues and the absence of 2022 regulatory charges associated with decreases in transco's estimated deferred state income tax rate;
•a favorable change in equity afudc as a result of increased capital expenditures at transco;
•the absence of losses related to eminence storage cavern abandonments in 2022.
gain on sale of business reflects a gain recognized on the sale of certain liquids pipelines in the gulf coast region in september 2023 (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures).
2022 vs. 2021
transmission & gulf of mexico modified ebitda increased primarily due to higher service revenues, partially offset by higher other segment costs and expenses.
service revenues increased primarily due to:
•a $163 million increase in transco's service revenues primarily associated with the leidy south expansion project placed fully in service in december 2021, park and loan services, short-term firm transportation, overall demand, and commodity fee revenues. additionally, 2022 benefited from higher reimbursable electric power costs and storage rates effective since the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by lower cash out surcharges, all of which are offset by similar changes in electricity, storage and cash out charges reflected in other segment costs and expenses;
•a $21 million increase in the eastern gulf coast region primarily due to higher production handling and gathering volumes from the absence of temporary shut-ins due to producer operational issues and weather-related events in 2021, partially offset by a decrease at gulfstar one for the tubular bells field primarily due to lower production handling, gathering and transportation volumes from natural decline;
•a $16 million increase primarily related to storage and transportation revenues due to the acquisition of nortex in august 2022; partially offset by
•a $13 million decrease in the western gulf coast region primarily at perdido due to lower transportation and gathering volumes from temporary downtime from producer operational issues in 2022.
commodity margins associated with our equity ngls increased $5 million primarily driven by favorable ngl sales prices, partially offset by higher prices for natural gas purchases associated with our equity ngl production activities.
other segment costs and expenses increased primarily due to higher operating costs including higher reimbursable electric power costs and storage costs, partially offset by favorable cash out charges, all of which are offset by similar changes in electricity reimbursements, cash out charges, and storage revenues reflected in service revenues. additionally, 2022 was impacted by higher costs associated with the leidy south expansion project; maintenance costs primarily related to general maintenance at transco, gulf coast region, and northwest pipeline; charges related to eminence storage cavern abandonments and monitoring; and regulatory charges associated with a decrease in transco's estimated deferred state income tax rate, higher employee-related costs, corporate allocations, and operations acquired in the nortex asset purchase. these increases are partially offset by a favorable change in the deferral of aro related depreciation at transco.

________________
(1) included as a component of commodity margins.
2023 vs. 2022
west modified ebitda increased primarily due to a favorable change in net realized gain (loss) from commodity derivatives relating to service revenues, higher proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments, and lower other segment costs and expenses, partially offset by lower commodity margins and service revenues.
service revenues decreased primarily due to:
•a $120 million decrease in the barnett shale region primarily due to lower gathering rates driven by unfavorable commodity pricing;
•a $13 million decrease in the eagle ford shale region primarily due to lower mvc revenues, partially offset by escalated gathering rates and higher gathering volumes;
•a $6 million decrease associated with reimbursable compressor power and fuel purchases primarily due to lower prices, which are offset by similar changes in other segment costs and expenses; partially offset by
•a $69 million increase in the haynesville shale region primarily associated with higher gathering volumes including from increased producer activity and the trace acquisition in april 2022, partially offset by lower rates driven by unfavorable commodity pricing;
•a $25 million increase in the dj basin region primarily associated with the dj basin acquisitions in november 2023 (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures);
•a $15 million increase in our other ngl operations associated with higher storage fees primarily due to a new contract as well as higher fractionation fees primarily due to higher volumes partially offset by lower rates from lower natural gas prices.
net realized gain (loss) from commodity derivatives relating to service revenues reflects a favorable change in settled commodity prices relative to our natural gas hedge positions.
commodity margins decreased $68 million primarily due a $46 million decrease from our equity ngls and a $14 million decrease from other sales activities, both primarily due to lower net realized commodity pricing.
other segment costs and expenses decreased primarily due to a favorable change in our net imbalance liability due to changes in pricing, favorable contract settlements in first-quarter 2023, lower corporate allocations, and lower reimbursable compressor power and fuel purchases which are substantially offset in service revenues. these items were partially offset by higher operating expenses related to operations including those acquired in the trace acquisition and the dj basin acquisitions, lower system gains at wamsutter, and a fourth quarter 2023 write-down of assets held for sale.
proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments increased primarily due to higher volumes at oppl as well as higher volumes at rmm, partially offset by lower proportional results as rmm was consolidated as of november 30, 2023.
2022 vs. 2021
west modified ebitda increased primarily due to higher service revenues and a favorable change in net realized gain (loss) from commodity derivatives, partially offset by higher other segment costs and expenses.
service revenues increased primarily due to:
•a $186 million increase in the haynesville shale region primarily due to higher gathering volumes including volumes from the trace acquisition as well as higher gathering rates driven by favorable commodity pricing;
•a $96 million increase in the barnett shale region primarily due to higher gathering rates driven by favorable commodity pricing;
•a $14 million increase associated with higher fractionation fees primarily due to higher fractionation volumes from a new contract;
•a $4 million increase in the eagle ford shale region primarily due to higher mvc revenues, escalated gathering rates, and higher deferred revenue amortization, substantially offset by lower volumes due to decreased producer activity; partially offset by
•a $10 million decrease in the wamsutter region primarily due to lower mvc revenue.
net realized gain (loss) from commodity derivatives relating to service revenues changed favorably due to a change in settled commodity prices relative to our hedge positions.
product margins from our equity ngls increased $6 million primarily due to higher net realized ngl sales prices, partially offset by higher net realized prices for natural gas purchases associated with our equity ngl production activities. additionally, volumes of equity ngl sold and natural gas purchased associated with our equity ngl production activities were lower primarily due to a customer contract change. margins from other sales activities increased $16 million primarily due to higher condensate sales and favorable pricing. marketing margins decreased $20 million primarily due to the absence of the favorable impact of winter storm uri in the first quarter of 2021.
other segment costs and expenses increased primarily due to higher operating expenses related to timing and scope of activities including from operations acquired in the trace acquisition, the absence of gains on asset sales in
2021, higher corporate allocations, acquisition-related costs associated with the trace acquisition, and an unfavorable change in our net imbalance liability due to changes in pricing.
proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments increased primarily due to higher volumes at oppl and higher commodity prices and volumes at rmm.

2023 vs. 2022
gas & ngl marketing services modified ebitda increased primarily due to a favorable change in net unrealized gain (loss) from commodity derivative instruments within segment revenues and higher commodity margins, partially offset by an unfavorable change in net unrealized gain (loss) from commodity derivative instruments within net processing commodity expenses.
commodity margins increased $66 million primarily due to:
•a $65 million increase from our natural gas marketing operations including $129 million of higher natural gas storage marketing margins primarily driven by a favorable change of $111 million in lower of cost or net realizable value adjustment; and the absence of a $15 million charge related to the remaining recognition of a purchase accounting inventory fair value adjustment in 2022. the increase in our natural gas marketing margins was partially offset by $64 million of lower natural gas transportation capacity marketing margins due to less favorable net realized pricing spreads;
•a $1 million increase in our ngl marketing margins including a $20 million favorable change in lower of cost or net realizable value inventory adjustments, partially offset by higher transportation and fractionation fees and an unfavorable change in net realized gains and losses on sale of inventory in 2023 compared to 2022 driven by an unfavorable change in ngl prices.
net unrealized gain (loss) from commodity derivative instruments within segment revenues and net processing commodity expenses relates to derivative contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. the change from 2022 is primarily due to a change in forward commodity prices relative to our hedge positions in 2023 compared to 2022.
2022 vs. 2021
gas & ngl marketing services modified ebitda decreased primarily due to higher net unrealized loss from derivative instruments and higher other segment costs and expenses, partially offset by higher commodity margins.
commodity margins increased $158 million primarily due to:
•a $188 million increase in natural gas marketing margins which included the following:
◦a $301 million increase in natural gas transportation capacity marketing margins primarily resulting from the sequent acquisition in the third quarter of 2021 and an increase in favorable pricing spreads in 2022 compared to 2021; partially offset by
◦a $58 million decrease associated with our legacy natural gas marketing operations primarily due to the absence of the favorable impact of winter storm uri in the first quarter of 2021;
◦a $55 million decrease in natural gas storage marketing margins due primarily to an increase in lower of cost or net realizable value inventory adjustments of $115 million and higher storage fees, partially offset by higher storage withdrawals in 2022 compared to 2021.
•a $30 million decrease in our ngl marketing margins primarily due to lower of cost or net realizable value inventory adjustments in 2022.
net unrealized gain (loss) from commodity derivative instruments changed primarily due to the sequent acquisition in july 2021, and a change in forward commodity prices relative to our hedge positions in 2022 compared to 2021.
other segment costs and expenses increased primarily due to higher employee-related costs related to the sequent acquisition and higher corporate allocations.

2023 vs. 2022
other modified ebitda increased primarily due to the net gain from energy transfer litigation judgment (see note 17 - contingencies and commitments), partially offset by lower results from our upstream operations, which included the following:
•$113 million decrease in net realized product sales primarily due to lower net realized commodity prices, partially offset by higher sales associated with increased production volumes. higher natural gas production volumes from new wells in our haynesville shale region and higher crude oil production volumes from new wells in our wamsutter region were partially offset by lower natural gas and ngl production volumes in our wamsutter region driven by the impact of severe winter weather in 2023;
•a $24 million unfavorable change in net unrealized gain (loss) from commodity derivative instruments due to a change in forward commodity prices relative to our hedge positions in 2023 compared to 2022; partially offset by
•an increase in other segment costs and expenses associated with our upstream operations primarily due to increased production volumes and expenses related to severe winter weather in 2023, partially offset by lower associated ad valorem and production taxes, which were impacted by lower commodity prices and lower natural gas and ngl production volumes in our wamsutter region.
other segment costs and expenses not associated with our upstream operations decreased primarily due to the absence of an $11 million charge related to an accrual for loss contingency in the third quarter of 2022 and a $19 million favorable change associated with regulatory assets related to the effects of deferred taxes on equity funds used during construction.
2022 vs. 2021
other modified ebitda increased primarily due to $248 million higher results from our upstream operations which included the following:
•a $289 million increase in net realized product sales primarily due to higher commodity prices in 2022, partially offset by the absence of the favorable impact of winter storm uri in 2021 and an unfavorable change in net realized gain (loss) from commodity derivative instruments due to an increase in commodity prices relative to our hedge positions and an increase in the volume of production hedged in 2022 compared to 2021. net realized product sales also increased due to higher production from new wells and higher volumes associated with acquisitions of additional ownership interests in 2021;
•a $25 million favorable change in net unrealized gain (loss) from commodity derivative instruments due to a change in forward commodity prices relative to our hedge positions and an increase in the volume of production hedged in 2022 compared to 2021; partially offset by
•a $66 million increase in other segment costs and expenses primarily due to the increased scale of our upstream operations and higher associated production taxes, which were also impacted by higher commodity prices and higher volumes as well as higher tax rates.
other segment costs and expenses also includes an $11 million charge related to an accrual for loss contingency in 2022, substantially offset by the absence of a $10 million charge related to an accrual for loss contingency in 2021.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and liquidity overview we have continued to focus on earnings and cash flow growth, noting significant increases in both net income and cash provided by operating activities. during 2023, investing and financing expenditures included $2.5 billion of capital expenditures, $1.6 billion of acquisitions including mountainwest and cureton, and $2.2 billion of dividends paid to common shareholders. these expenditures were funded in part by $5.9 billion of cash provided by operating activities (which includes a net $534 million related to our favorable energy transfer litigation outcome - see note 17 - contingencies and commitments), and cash from borrowing activities of $2.5 billion. our financial position also reflects the deferred consideration obligation for the rmm acquisition (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures). we ended the year with $2.150 billion of cash and cash equivalents as reported on our consolidated balance sheet. see also the following section titled sources (uses) of cash.
outlook our growth capital and investment expenditures in 2024 are currently expected to be in a range from $1.45 billion to $1.75 billion, excluding the gulf coast storage acquisition for $1.95 billion (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures). growth capital spending in 2024 primarily includes transco expansions, all of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements, projects supporting growth in the haynesville basin, and projects supporting the northeast g&p business. we also expect to invest capital in our other segment ventures. in addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that reduce emissions, and meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments. we intend to fund substantially all planned 2024 capital spending with cash available after paying dividends. we retain the flexibility to adjust planned levels of growth capital and investment expenditures in response to changes in economic conditions or business opportunities including the repurchase of our common stock.
on january 5, 2024, we issued $2.1 billion in long-term debt (see note 12 - debt and banking arrangements).
as of december 31, 2023, we have approximately $2.337 billion of long-term debt due within one year. our potential sources of liquidity available to address these maturities include cash on hand, proceeds from refinancing, our credit facility, or our commercial paper program, as well as proceeds from asset monetizations.
liquidity based on our forecasted levels of cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to manage our businesses in 2024. our potential material internal and external sources and uses of liquidity are as follows:

potential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity discussed above include those previously discussed in company outlook.
at december 31, 2023, we had a working capital deficit of $1.317 billion, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt due within one year. our available liquidity is as follows:

(1)in managing our available liquidity, we do not expect a maximum outstanding amount in excess of the capacity of our credit facility inclusive of any outstanding amounts under our commercial paper program. we had $725 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31, 2023. the highest amount outstanding under our commercial paper program and credit facility during 2023 was $730 million. at december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the financial covenants associated with our credit facility. see note 12 - debt and banking arrangements for additional information on our credit facility and commercial paper program.
dividends we increased our regular quarterly cash dividend to common stockholders by approximately 5.3 percent from the $0.425 per share paid in each quarter of 2022, to $0.4475 per share paid in each quarter of 2023.
registrations prior to the expiration of our shelf registration statement, we anticipate filing a new shelf registration statement as a well-known seasoned issuer.
distributions from equity-method investees the organizational documents of entities in which we have an equity-method investment generally require periodic distributions of their available cash to their members. in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating their respective businesses. see note 8 - investing activities for our more significant equity-method investees.
credit ratings the interest rates at which we are able to borrow money are impacted by our credit ratings. the current ratings are as follows:
rating agency                    outlook        senior unsecured debt rating s&amp;p global ratings           stable         bbb moody's investors service        stable         baa2
fitch ratings                    stable         bbb these credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. no assurance can be given that the credit rating agencies will continue to assign us investment-grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their current criteria for investment-grade ratios. a downgrade of our credit ratings might increase our future cost of borrowing and, if ratings were to fall below investment-grade, could require us to provide additional collateral to third parties, negatively impacting our available liquidity.

operating activities the factors that determine operating activities are largely the same as those that affect net income (loss), with the exception of noncash items such as depreciation and amortization, provision (benefit) for deferred income taxes, equity (earnings) losses, net unrealized (gain) loss from commodity derivative instruments, gain on sale of business, inventory write-downs, and amortization of stock-based awards.
our net cash provided (used) by operating activities in 2023 increased from 2022 primarily due to higher operating income (excluding noncash items as previously discussed), as well as favorable changes in net operating working capital and margin requirements, partially offset by lower distributions from equity-method investees.
our net cash provided (used) by operating activities in 2022 increased from 2021 primarily due to higher operating income (excluding noncash items as previously discussed), favorable changes in margin requirements, and higher distributions from equity-method investees, partially offset by net unfavorable changes in net operating working capital.
environmental we are a participant in certain environmental activities in various stages including assessment studies, cleanup operations, and/or remedial processes at certain sites, some of which we currently do not own (see note 17 - contingencies and commitments). we are monitoring these sites in a coordinated effort with other potentially responsible parties, the epa, or other governmental authorities. we are jointly and severally liable along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities and solely responsible in others. current estimates of the most likely costs of such activities are approximately $48 million, all of which are included in accrued and other current liabilities and regulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2023. we will seek to recover approximately $3 million of accrued costs related to remediation activities by our interstate gas pipelines through future natural gas transmission rates. the remainder of these costs will be funded from operations. during 2023, we paid approximately $7 million for cleanup and/or remediation and monitoring activities. we expect to pay approximately $9 million in 2024 for these activities. estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally based on completed assessment studies, preliminary results of studies, or our experience with other similar cleanup operations. at december 31, 2023, certain assessment studies were still in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield different estimates of most likely costs. therefore, the actual costs incurred will depend on the final amount, type, and extent of contamination discovered at these sites, the final cleanup standards mandated by the epa or other governmental authorities, and other factors.
the epa and various state regulatory agencies routinely propose and promulgate new rules and issue updated guidance to existing rules. these rulemakings include, but are not limited to, rules for reciprocating internal combustion engine and combustion turbine maximum achievable control technology, reviews and updates to the national ambient air quality standards, and rules for new and existing source performance standards for volatile organic compounds and methane. we continuously monitor these regulatory changes and how they may impact our operations. implementation of new or modified regulations may result in impacts to our operations and increase the cost of additions to property, plant, and equipment - net in the consolidated balance sheet for both new and existing facilities in affected areas; however, due to regulatory uncertainty on final rule content and applicability timeframes, we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost these regulatory impacts at this time.
we consider prudently incurred environmental assessment and remediation costs and the costs associated with compliance with environmental standards to be recoverable through rates for our interstate natural gas transmission pipelines. historically, with limited exceptions, we have been permitted recovery of these environmental costs, and it is our intent to continue seeking recovery of such costs through future rate filings.

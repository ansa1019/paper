item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
executive overview description of the company, recent strategic actions and business segments baxter international inc. is a global medical technology with approximately 60,000 employees worldwide who are engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products, digital health solutions and therapies used by hospitals, kidney dialysis centers, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, ambulatory surgery centers, doctors' offices and patients at home under physician supervision. our global footprint and the critical nature of our products and services, which are sold in over 100 countries as of december 31, 2023, play a key role in expanding access to healthcare in emerging and developed countries.
in mid-2022, our board of directors authorized a strategic review of our business portfolio, with the goal of increasing stockholder value. as part of that review process, we identified and evaluated a range of potential strategic actions, including opportunities for sales and other separation transactions. in january 2023, following the completion of that review, we announced the following planned strategic actions that are intended to enhance our operational effectiveness, accelerate innovation and drive additional stockholder value: (a) a proposed spinoff of our kidney care business into an independent publicly traded company focused on kidney care and organ support (the proposed spinoff), (b) our development of a new operating model to simplify our operations and better align our manufacturing and supply chain to our commercial activities and (c) our pursuit of strategic alternatives for our biopharma solutions (bps) business.
proposed separation of kidney care business we are working to complete the proposed separation of our kidney care business in the interest of establishing an independent company focused on kidney care and organ support. while we continue to evaluate all strategic options in the interest of maximizing stockholder value, we continue to progress towards our current target of july 2024 for completion of the proposed spinoff of this business. in both 2023 and 2022 we generated $4.45 billion of combined net sales from our kidney care segment, representing approximately 30% and 31%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. we intend for the proposed spinoff to qualify as tax-free to baxter and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the proposed spinoff is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including final approval from our board of directors, the filing and effectiveness of a registration statement on form 10, receipt of an internal revenue service (irs) ruling or related tax opinions from counsel, satisfactory completion of financing arrangements, consultations with works councils and other employee representative bodies and any necessary regulatory approvals.
we incurred $225 million of pre-tax costs related to the proposed spin-off during 2023 and we expect to continue to incur significant separation-related costs in 2024. additionally, we expect to incur dis-synergies following our completion of the proposed spinoff transaction due to the reduced size of our company and, as a result, we will need to undertake actions to ensure that our cost structure is appropriate to support our remaining businesses.
there can be no guarantees that the proposed spinoff will be completed in the manner or over the timeframes described above, or at all.
implementation of new operating model and resulting segment change our reportable segments were previously comprised of the following geographic segments related to our legacy baxter business: americas (north and south america), emea (europe, middle east and africa) and apac (asia pacific), and a global segment for our hillrom business. as discussed below under "recent strategic actions," in the third quarter of 2023, we completed the implementation of a new operating model intended to simplify and streamline our operations and better align our manufacturing and supply chain to our commercial activities. under this new operating model, our business is comprised of four segments: medical products and therapies, healthcare systems and technologies (formerly referred to as our hillrom segment), pharmaceuticals and kidney care (which would become an independent publicly traded company following the completion of the proposed spinoff transaction). our segment reporting was changed during the third quarter of 2023 to align with our new operating model and prior period segment disclosures have been revised to reflect the new segments.
the medical products and therapies segment includes sales of our sterile iv solutions, infusion systems, administration sets, parenteral nutrition therapies and surgical hemostat, sealant and adhesion prevention products. the healthcare systems and technologies segment includes sales of our connected care solutions and collaboration tools, including smart bed systems, patient monitoring systems and diagnostic technologies, respiratory health devices and advanced equipment for the surgical space, including surgical video technologies, precision positioning devices and other accessories. the pharmaceuticals segment includes sales of specialty injectable pharmaceuticals, inhaled anesthesia and drug compounding. the kidney care segment includes sales of chronic and acute dialysis therapies and services, including peritoneal dialysis (pd), hemodialysis (hd), continuous renal replacement therapies (crrt) and other organ support therapies. other sales not allocated to a segment primarily include sales of products and services provided directly through certain of our manufacturing facilities and royalty income under a business development arrangement that ended in early 2023 when we acquired the related product rights.
for financial information about our segments, see note 18 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
sale of bps business on september 29, 2023, we completed the sale of our bps business and received cash proceeds of $3.96 billion from that transaction. the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of our bps business, including the $2.88 billion pre-tax gain ($2.59 billion net of tax) from the sale of that business and the related cash proceeds received, are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. we intend to use substantially all of the after-tax proceeds from this transaction to repay certain of our debt obligations, including $514 million of commercial paper borrowings and $2.28 billion of long-term debt that we repaid during the fourth quarter of 2023.
see note 2 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
financial results our global net sales totaled $14.81 billion in 2023, an increase of 2% over 2022 on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis. international sales totaled $7.81 billion in 2023, an increase of 3% compared to 2022 on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis. sales in the united states totaled $7.00 billion in 2023, an increase of 1% compared to 2022. refer to the net sales discussion in the results of operations section below for more information related to changes in net sales on a constant currency basis.
net income (loss) attributable to baxter stockholders totaled $2.66 billion, or $5.25 per diluted share, in 2023. net income (loss) attributable to baxter stockholders in 2023 included special items which increased net income by $1.18 billion, or $2.33 per diluted share. see our special items subsection, in the results of operations section below, for information about special items for all periods present.
net income (loss) from continuing operations totaled $(69) million, or $(0.15) per diluted share, in 2023. net income (loss) from continuing operations in 2023 included special items which adversely impacted our results by $1.40 billion, or $2.75 per diluted share.
our financial results included research and development (r&d) expenses totaling $667 million in 2023, which reflects our focus on balancing investments to support our new product pipeline with efforts to optimize overall r&d spending (including with respect to the maintenance of our portfolio).
while we continue to face continuing global macroeconomic challenges, our financial position remains strong, with operating cash flows from continuing operations totaling $1.70 billion in 2023. we have continued to execute on our disciplined capital allocation framework, as discussed in the "business strategy" section in item 1. business of this annual report on form 10-k, which is designed to optimize stockholder value creation through reinvestment in our businesses, dividends and share repurchases, as well as acquisitions and other business development initiatives and debt repayments, consistent with our previously stated commitment to achieve our net leverage targets.
capital expenditures totaled $692 million in 2023 as we continue to invest across our businesses to support future growth, including additional investments in support of new and existing product capacity expansions. our investments in capital expenditures in 2023 were focused on projects that improve production efficiency, enhance our quality systems and optimize manufacturing capabilities to support our business growth.
we also continued to return value to our stockholders. during 2023, we paid cash dividends to our stockholders totaling $586 million.
during 2024, we expect to continue to incur significant separation-related costs related to the proposed spinoff, which may adversely impact our earnings and operating cash flows.
factors affecting our results of operations supply constraints and global economic conditions we have experienced significant challenges to our global supply chain in recent periods, including production delays and interruptions, increased costs and shortages of raw materials and component parts (including resins and electromechanical devices) and higher transportation costs, resulting from the pandemic and other exogenous factors including significant weather events, elevated inflation levels, increased interest rates, disruptions to certain ports of call and access to shipping ports around the world, the war in ukraine, the conflict in the middle east (including recent attacks on merchant ships in the red sea), tensions between china and taiwan and other geopolitical events. due to the nature of our products, which include dense consumable medical products such as iv fluids, and the geographic locations of our manufacturing facilities, which often require us to transport our products long distances, we may be more susceptible to increases in freight costs and other supply chain challenges than certain of our industry peers. while we have seen some improvements in the availability of certain component parts and improved pricing in certain raw materials, these challenges have not completely subsided and may continue to have a negative impact on our supply chain in future periods. these challenges, including the unavailability of certain raw materials and component parts, have also had a negative impact on our sales for certain product categories (including those acquired in our december 2021 acquisition of hill-rom holdings, inc. (hillrom)) due to our inability to fully satisfy demand and may continue to have a negative impact on our sales in the future.
our results of operations are also affected by macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. the war in ukraine, the conflict in the middle east (including recent attacks on merchant ships in the red sea), tensions between china and taiwan and the sanctions and other measures being imposed in response to these conflicts (and the potential for escalation of these conflicts) have increased the levels of economic and political uncertainty and we continue to closely monitor the developing situations. with respect to the war in ukraine and our business in russia, we have substantially completed our wind down efforts related to our business in russia in a manner that we structured to be compliant with all applicable u.s. and european union sanctions and regulations. while these countries do not constitute a material portion of our business, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the current scope of these conflicts could have an adverse effect on our business in the region.
our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics. covid-19 had, and it or any other future public health crisis could in the future have an adverse impact on, among other things, our expenses, operations, supply chains and distribution systems. over the course of the covid-19 pandemic, our business was impacted by shifting healthcare priorities and significant volatility in the demand for our products, and any resurgence of the pandemic or any new public health crisis could again impact healthcare priorities and cause volatility in the demand for our products.
the existence of high inflation rates in the united states and in many of the countries where we conduct business has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates, shipping costs, labor costs and other costs and expenses. additionally, adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates have increased our costs of sourcing certain raw materials in some jurisdictions. we have experienced and may continue to experience inflationary increases in manufacturing costs and operating expenses, and we may not be able to pass these cost increases on to our customers in a timely manner or at all, which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations. inflation and general macroeconomic factors have caused certain of our customers to reduce or delay orders for our products and services and could cause them to do so in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our sales and results of operations.
as a medical products company, our operations and many of the products manufactured or sold by us are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies, both within and outside the united states. these regulations, as described in "government regulation" in item 1. business of this annual report on form 10-k, require that we obtain specific approval from the food and drug administration (fda) and non-u.s. regulatory authorities before we can market and sell most of our products in a particular country. failure to obtain or maintain those approvals or clearances could have a material adverse impact on our business (including with respect to our ability to compete in the product markets in which we currently operate). furthermore, fda in the united states, the european medicines agency (ema) in europe, the china food and drug administration (cfda) in china and other government agencies, inside and outside of the united states, administer requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and advertising, distribution and post-market surveillance of our products. our failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to various actions, including warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
for further discussion, please refer to item 1a. risk factors of this annual report on form 10-k.
recent business combinations and asset acquisitions zosyn on march 22, 2022, we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of pfizer inc. to acquire the rights to zosyn, a premixed frozen piperacillin-tazobactam product, in the u.s. and canada. zosyn is used for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections, nosocomial pneumonia, skin and skin structure infections, female pelvic infections and community-acquired pneumonia. under the terms of the acquisition, we paid the acquisition price of $122 million and received specified intellectual property, including patent rights, in the first quarter of 2022 and received additional intellectual property, including the product rights to zosyn, in the first quarter of 2023. under the arrangement, we received profit sharing payments from sales of zosyn until the product rights transferred to us in march 2023. refer to note 3 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our acquisition of the rights to zosyn.
hillrom on december 13, 2021, we completed our acquisition of all outstanding equity interests of hillrom for a purchase price of $10.48 billion. including the assumption of hillrom's outstanding debt obligations, the enterprise value of the transaction was $12.84 billion.
hillrom was a global medical technology leader whose products and services help enable earlier diagnosis and treatment, optimize surgical efficiency, and accelerate patient recovery while simplifying clinical communication and shifting care closer to home. hillrom made those outcomes possible through digital and connected care solutions and collaboration tools, including smart bed systems, patient monitoring and diagnostic technologies, respiratory health devices, advanced equipment for the surgical space and more, delivering actionable, real-time insights at the point of care.
in 2023 and 2022 our healthcare systems and technologies segment (formerly our hillrom segment) generated net sales of $3.01 billion and $2.94 billion, respectively. during 2022, we also recognized $2.81 billion of goodwill impairments and $332 million of indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments related to goodwill and trade name intangible assets that arose from the hillrom acquisition. see notes 3, 5, 6 and 18 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information about the hillrom acquisition, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, hillrom acquisition financing arrangements and our healthcare systems and technologies segment results, respectively.
perclot on july 29, 2021, we acquired certain assets related to perclot polysaccharide hemostatic system (perclot), including distribution rights for the u.s. and specified territories outside of the u.s., from cryolife, inc. for an upfront purchase price of $25 million and the potential for additional cash consideration of up to $36 million, which had an acquisition-date fair value of $28 million, based upon regulatory and commercial milestones. perclot is an absorbable powder hemostat indicated for use in surgical procedures, including cardiac, vascular, orthopedic, spinal, neurological, gynecological, ent and trauma surgery as an adjunct hemostat when control of bleeding from capillary, venous, or arteriolar vessels by pressure, ligature, and other conventional means is either ineffective or impractical. refer to note 3 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding the acquisition of perclot.
transderm scop on march 31, 2021, we acquired the rights to transderm scop (tds) for the u.s. and specified territories outside of the u.s. from subsidiaries of glaxosmithkline for an upfront purchase price of $60 million including the cost of acquired inventory and the potential for additional cash consideration of $30 million, which had an acquisition-date fair value of $24 million, based upon regulatory approval of a new contract manufacturer by a specified date. we previously sold this product under a distribution license to the u.s. institutional market. tds is indicated for post-operative nausea and vomiting in the u.s. and motion sickness in european markets. refer to note 3 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding the acquisition of tds.
caelyx and doxil on february 17, 2021, we acquired the rights to caelyx and doxil, the branded versions of liposomal doxorubicin, from a subsidiary of johnson & johnson for specified territories outside of the u.s for $325 million in cash. we previously acquired the u.s. rights to this product in 2019. liposomal doxorubicin is a chemotherapy medicine used to treat various types of cancer. refer to note 3 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding the acquisition of caelyx and doxil.
non-gaap financial measures our presentation of percentage changes in net sales at constant currency rates, which is computed using current period local currency sales at the prior period's foreign exchange rates, is a non-gaap financial measure. this measure provides information about growth (or declines) in our net sales as if foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior period and the current period. we believe that the non-gaap measure of percent change in net sales at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the u.s. gaap measure of percent change in net sales at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding and facilitate a fuller analysis of our results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

foreign currency adversely impacted net sales by 1 percentage point during the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the turkish lira, chinese renminbi, australian dollar, japanese yen and the canadian dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro and mexican peso. our acquisition of hillrom in december 2021 favorably impacted net sales by 23 percentage points for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period. foreign currency adversely impacted net sales by 5 percentage points during the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro, british pound, turkish lira, australian dollar, japanese yen and chinese renminbi.

medical product and therapies segment net sales increased 4% for the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year period.
infusion therapies and technologies net sales increased 4% for the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year period. sales performance in 2023 reflected strong demand for our infusion systems and administration sets, as well as growth in iv solutions and international nutrition compounding, partially offset by lower sales of parenteral nutrition products in the u.s. as compared with the prior year period.
advanced surgery net sales increased 5% for the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year period, driven by continued recovery in surgical procedures, partially offset by temporary supply constraints, the exit of a product distribution arrangement and a comparison against prior year periods that benefited from competitor supply constraints. foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacted net sales by 1% for the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year period.

medical product and therapies segment net sales remained flat for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period.
infusion therapies and technologies net sales decreased 1% for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period. sales performance in 2022 reflected lower sales of infusion pumps, sales headwinds in china driven by covid-related lockdowns and lower sales of vitamins resulting from ongoing supply constraints. supply chain constraints, including constraints related to the availability of semiconductor components and other components used in the production of our infusion pumps, adversely impacted sales of infusion pumps. those items were offset by increased demand for iv administration sets and solutions, reflecting a recovery in hospital administration rates and surgical procedures and lower growth in the u.s. for our parenteral nutrition therapies and related products, including multi-chamber bags. foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacted net sales by 4% for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period.
advanced surgery net sales increased 2% for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period, driven by a continued recovery in surgical procedures, particularly in europe, and benefits from competitor supply constraints. foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacted net sales by 6% for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period.

our results in 2023 included $19 million of integration-related costs, primarily related to our integration of hillrom, offset by a $19 million benefit from changes in the estimated fair values of contingent consideration liabilities. our results in 2022 included $213 million of acquisition and integration-related items, which reflected $93 million of integration-related costs and $159 million of incremental cost of sales from the fair value step-ups on acquired hillrom inventory that was sold in 2022, partially offset by a $39 million benefit from changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. our results in 2021 included acquisition, integration and related financing expenses of $236 million. this included acquisition, integration and related financing expenses for our acquisition of hillrom and the acquisition of the rights to caelyx and doxil for specified territories outside of the u.s. these expenses were partially offset by benefits from changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. refer to note 3 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information regarding business and asset acquisitions.
our results in 2023, 2022 and 2021 included $48 million, $48 million and $42 million, respectively, of incremental costs to comply with the european union's medical device regulations for previously registered products, which primarily consist of contractor costs and other direct third-party costs. we consider the adoption of these regulations to be a significant one-time regulatory charge and believe that the costs of initial compliance for previously registered products over the implementation period are not indicative of our core operating results.
our results in 2023 and 2022 included $225 million and $7 million of separation-related costs, primarily reflecting costs of external advisors supporting our activities to prepare for the proposed spinoff of our kidney care segment. we also incurred $17 million and $5 million of additional separation-related costs in 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the sale of our bps business that are reported in discontinued operations and are not presented in the table above.
our results in 2023 included $7 million of net costs from certain legal matters. these costs included $13 million, including related legal fees, related to matters involving alleged violations of the false claims act related to a now-discontinued legacy hillrom sales line and alleged injury from environmental exposure, partially offset by $6 million of proceeds received, net of related legal fees, from a settlement related to an intellectual property dispute. our results in 2021 included legal fees of $13 million associated with claimants alleging injuries as a result of proximity to one of our plants.
our results in 2021 included charges of $31 million for investigation and related costs for matters associated with our previously announced investigation of foreign exchange gains and losses. refer to note 8 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information regarding these charges.
our results in 2022 included a loss of $54 million under an arrangement to divest certain product rights for an amount that is less than our cost of those product rights, which was triggered by u.s. and european union regulatory approvals of the related products. refer to note 3 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information about the related transactions.
our results in 2022 included a loss of $21 million related to our deconsolidation of a foreign subsidiary, including the derecognition of a related noncontrolling interest, upon its liquidation in december 2022 that was completed in connection with our legal entity rationalization activities.
our results in 2022 included a curtailment gain of $11 million related to an announced change for active non-bargaining participants in our u.s. hillrom pension plan. refer to note 13 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information regarding this curtailment gain.
our results in 2022 included a charge of $65 million for cumulative translation adjustments (cta) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a result of the substantial liquidation of our operations in argentina.
our results in 2023 included $49 million of net pre-tax losses from non-marketable investments in several early-stage companies, consisting of $52 million of noncash impairment write-downs, partially offset by a $3 million gain from the sale of an investment.
our results in 2021 included a loss of $5 million on the early extinguishment of the $2.40 billion debt assumed as part of the hillrom acquisition.
our results in 2023 included a $5 million net income tax benefit from internal reorganization transactions, primarily related to the proposed spinoff of our kidney care segment, and a $9 million valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset for a tax basis step-up related to previously enacted swiss tax reform legislation to reflect our current estimate of its recoverability. our results in 2022 included a $25 million valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset for a tax basis step-up related to previously enacted swiss tax reform legislation to reflect our current estimate of its recoverability. our results in 2021 included a $58 million income tax benefit related to a tax-deductible foreign statutory loss on an investment in a foreign subsidiary and an $18 million income tax benefit related to a change in u.s. foreign tax credit regulations, partially offset by a $22 million income tax expense related to an unfavorable court ruling for an uncertain tax position.

gross margin the gross margin ratio was 33.6%, 34.9% and 38.9% for the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the special items identified earlier in this section had an unfavorable impact on gross margin ratio of 7.6 percentage points in both 2023 and 2022 and 3.5 percentage points in 2021. refer to the special items caption earlier in this section for additional detail.
excluding the impact of special items, the gross margin ratio decreased 1.3 percentage points in 2023 compared to 2022 and increased 0.1 percentage points in 2022 compared to 2021. the decrease in 2023 was primarily due to the adverse cost impacts of raw materials inflation driving higher manufacturing costs and higher bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans, partially offset by manufacturing initiatives. the increase in 2022 was due to a favorable product mix that was primarily driven by our acquisition of hillrom, lower bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans, lower u.s. customer rebates and $28 million of incremental revenue from a customer that did not meet its contractual minimum purchase requirements, partially offset by raw materials inflation and, to a lesser extent, increased supply chain costs.
sg&a the sg&a expense ratio was 26.6% in both 2023 and 2022 and 23.4% in 2021. the special items identified earlier in this section had an unfavorable impact on the sg&a expense ratio of 4.1, 3.9 and 2.1 percentage points in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. refer to the special items caption earlier in this section for additional detail.
excluding the impact of special items, the sg&a expense ratio decreased 0.2 percentage points in 2023 compared to 2022 and increased 1.4 percentage points in 2022 compared to 2021. the decrease in 2023 was primarily due to savings from restructuring actions implemented in recent periods, partially offset by higher bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans. the increase in 2022 was primarily due to the acquisition of hillrom and increased outbound freight costs, partially offset by lower bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans.
r&d the r&d expense ratio was 4.5%, 4.2% and 4.4% for the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the special items identified earlier in this section had an unfavorable impact on the r&d expense ratio of 0.1 percentage points both in 2023 and 2022 and had no impact on the r&d expense ratio in 2021. refer to the special items caption earlier in this section for additional detail.
excluding the impact of special items, the r&d expense ratio increased 0.3 percentage points in 2023 compared to 2022 and decreased 0.3 basis points in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase in 2023 was driven by increased project-related expenditures, particularly related to the connected care portfolio in our healthcare systems and technologies segment, and higher bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans. the decrease in 2022 reflected lower bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans, partially offset by an increase in r&d spend following the hillrom acquisition.
business optimization items in recent years, we have undertaken actions to transform our cost structure and enhance operational efficiency. these efforts have included restructuring the organization, optimizing our manufacturing footprint, r&d operations and supply chain network, employing disciplined cost management, and centralizing and streamlining certain support functions. the costs of these actions consisted primarily of employee termination costs, implementation costs, contract termination costs and asset impairments.
we incurred restructuring charges of $534 million, $225 million and $114 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. in 2023, $111 million of our restructuring charges, consisting of employee termination costs, were related to the implementation of our previously announced new operating model intended to simplify and streamline our operations. in addition, $267 million of the restructuring charges, consisting of $243 million of long-lived asset impairment charges, $14 million of other asset write-downs and $10 million of employee termination costs, were related to our decision to cease production of dialyzers at one of our manufacturing facilities in connection with our initiatives to streamline our manufacturing footprint and improve our profitability. in 2022, $85 million of our restructuring charges were related to integration activities for the hillrom acquisition, consisting of $55 million of employee termination costs, $22 million of contract termination and other costs and $8 million of asset impairments. for the year ended december 31, 2021, $37 million and $12 million, respectively, of restructuring charges, consisting of employee termination costs, were related to global programs to simplify and streamline our supply chain and finance functions.
we currently expect to incur additional pre-tax costs, primarily related to the implementation of business optimization programs, of approximately $50 million through the completion of initiatives that are currently underway. we continue to pursue cost savings initiatives and, to the extent further cost savings opportunities are identified, we would incur additional restructuring charges and costs to implement business optimization programs in future periods. refer to note 12 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our business optimization programs.
goodwill impairments we assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. we recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
we acquired hillrom on december 13, 2021 and recognized $6.83 billion of goodwill and $6.03 billion of other intangible assets, including $1.91 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets, in connection with that acquisition. during the third quarter of 2022, we performed trigger-based impairment tests for each of the reporting units within our hillrom segment (currently referred to as our healthcare systems and technologies segment), as well as the indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of trade names, that we acquired in connection with the hillrom acquisition. we performed those tests as of september 30, 2022 due to (a) current macroeconomic conditions, including the rising interest rate environment and broad declines in equity valuations, and (b) reduced earnings forecasts for our three hillrom reporting units, driven primarily by shortages of certain component parts used in our products, raw materials inflation and increased supply chain costs. those goodwill impairment tests resulted in total pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $2.79 billion in the third quarter of 2022. in connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed quantitative impairment tests for all our reporting units and recorded an additional $27 million goodwill impairment related to our global surgical solutions reporting unit (now combined with our previous patient support systems reporting unit in our care and connectivity solutions reporting unit). no goodwill impairments were recorded for our remaining reporting units in connection with our annual goodwill impairment tests because the fair values of those reporting units exceeded their net book values. refer to note 5 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding these goodwill impairment charges, as well as information about related indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges.
further adverse changes to macroeconomic conditions or our earnings forecasts could lead to additional goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods and such charges could be material to our results of operations. for further discussion, refer to item 1a. risk factors of this annual report on form 10-k.
other operating expense (income), net other operating expense (income), net was income of $28 million in 2023, an expense of $36 million in 2022 and income of $6 million in 2021. the income in 2023 was comprised of gains from changes in the fair values of contingent consideration arrangements and proceeds from a settlement related to an intellectual property dispute. in 2022, we recognized a loss of $54 million under an arrangement to divest certain product rights for an amount that was less than our cost of those product rights, which was triggered by u.s. and european union regulatory approvals of the related products. refer to note 3 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information about the related transactions. additionally, we recognized a loss of $21 million related to the deconsolidation of a foreign subsidiary, including the derecognition of a related noncontrolling interest, upon its liquidation in december 2022 that was completed in connection with our legal entity rationalization activities. those losses were partially offset by gains of $39 million from net decreases in the estimated fair values of contingent consideration liabilities. in 2021, we recognized $6 million of gains from net decreases in the estimated fair values of contingent consideration liabilities.
interest expense, net interest expense, net was $442 million, $395 million and $193 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase in 2023 was driven by higher interest rates on our floating rate debt, partially offset by net repayments in the current year periods and higher interest income in 2023. the increase in 2022 was primarily driven by higher average debt outstanding in connection with the hillrom acquisition, partially offset by acquisition bridge facility commitment fees recognized in 2021 and higher interest income in 2022.
we expect that our net interest expense will decrease in future periods as a result of debt repayments during the fourth quarter of 2023 and planned debt repayments during the first half of 2024 using the proceeds we received from the recent sale of our bps business. refer to note 6 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a summary of the components of interest expense, net for 2023, 2022 and 2021.
other (income) expense, net other (income) expense, net was expense of $51 million, $12 million and $41 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the net expense in 2023 was primarily driven by foreign exchange losses and non-marketable investment impairments, partially offset by pension and other postretirement benefits (opeb) and increases in the fair value of marketable equity securities. the net expense in 2022 was primarily due to the reclassification of a cumulative translation loss from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the substantial liquidation of our operations in argentina, partially offset by pension and opeb benefits, a pension curtailment gain and net increases in the fair value of marketable equity securities. the net expense in 2021 was primarily driven by foreign exchange losses, pension and opeb costs and a loss on debt extinguishment.
income taxes our effective income tax rate was 33.0%, (0.2)% and 7.4% in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the special items identified above impacted our effective tax rate by 12.0 percentage points, (19.8) percentage points and (7.4) percentage points in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. refer to the special items caption earlier in this section for additional detail. our effective income tax rate can differ from the 21% u.s. federal statutory rate due to a number of factors, including tax incentives, foreign rate differences, state income taxes, non-deductible expenses, non-taxable income, increases or decreases in valuation allowances and liabilities for uncertain tax positions, excess tax benefits or shortfalls on stock compensation awards, audit developments and legislative changes.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, the difference between our effective income tax rate and the u.s. federal statutory rate was impacted favorably by the jurisdictional mix of global earnings, which included the long-lived asset impairments we recognized during 2023, a $50 million net tax benefit after related valuation allowances from notional interest deductions received by certain wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries that have financed their operations with equity capital and a $21 million tax benefit related to research and development tax credits, partially offset by non-deductible separation-related income tax costs and tax shortfalls on stock compensation awards.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, the difference between our effective income tax rate and the u.s. federal statutory rate was primarily attributable to non-deductible impairments of goodwill acquired in the hillrom acquisition and valuation allowance increases, including a $25 million increase related to deferred tax assets from a tax basis step-up related to previously enacted swiss tax legislation. those items were partially offset by a $47 million net tax benefit after related valuation allowances from notional interest deductions.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, the difference between our effective income tax rate and the u.s. federal statutory rate was primarily attributable to favorable geographic earnings mix, a $50 million net tax benefit after related valuation allowances from notional interest deductions, a $58 million tax benefit related to a tax-deductible foreign statutory loss on an investment in a foreign subsidiary, a tax benefit related to a change in u.s. foreign tax credit regulations and excess tax benefits on stock compensation awards, partially offset by an unfavorable court decision in a foreign jurisdiction related to an uncertain tax position.
our tax provisions for 2023, 2022 and 2021 did not include any significant tax charges related to either the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (beat) or global intangible low taxed income (gilti) provisions, except for the inability to fully utilize foreign tax credits against such gilti. our accounting policy is to recognize any gilti charge as a period cost.
discontinued operations on september 29, 2023, we completed the sale of our bps business and received cash proceeds of $3.96 billion from that transaction. the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of our bps business, including our gain from the sale of that business and the related cash proceeds received, are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $2.73 billion, $233 million and $262 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase in the current year period was primarily driven by the $2.88 billion pre-tax gain from the sale of the bps business ($2.59 billion net of tax). excluding that gain on sale, pre-tax income from discontinued operations decreased by $90 million in 2023 compared to 2022, which was primarily driven by there being only nine months of activity through the sale of the business on september 29, 2023, lower sales from contract manufacturing of covid-19 vaccines and increased sg&a expenses in the current year period from separation-related costs. pre-tax income from discontinued operations decreased by $64 million in 2022 compared to 2021, which was primarily driven by lower sales from contract manufacturing of covid-19 vaccines. refer to note 2 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per diluted share net income (loss) for the total company, including discontinued operations, was income of $2.66 billion in 2023, loss of $2.42 billion in 2022 and income of $1.30 billion in 2021. diluted earnings (loss) per share for the total company, including discontinued operations, was $5.25 per share in 2023, $(4.83) per share in 2022 and $2.53 per share in 2021. the significant factors and events causing the net changes from 2022 to 2023 and from 2021 to 2022 are discussed above. additionally, earnings (loss) per share was positively impacted by the repurchase of 0.5 million shares in 2022 through rule 10b5-1 purchase plans. refer to note 9 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information regarding our stock repurchases.

medical products and therapies segment operating income was $972 million, $962 million and $955 million for the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. segment operating income increased in 2023 compared to the prior year due to the gross profit from higher sales, partially offset by increases in sg&a and r&d expenses. segment operating income increased in 2022 compared to the prior year due to decreases in r&d expenses, partially offset by lower gross margins.
healthcare systems and technologies segment operating income was $483 million, $494 million and $60 million for the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. segment operating income decreased in 2023 primarily due to increased r&d expenses, particularly related to the connected care portfolio. segment operating income increased in 2022 due to our acquisition of hillrom in december 2021. the 2021 amounts reflect activity over the 18-day period from the acquisition date through year-end.
pharmaceuticals segment operating income was $401 million, $391 million and $523 million for the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. segment operating income increased in 2023 primarily due to income from recent product launches, partially offset by a lower gross margin, primarily driven by raw materials inflation, and increased r&d expense. segment operating income decreased in 2022 primarily due to a lower gross margin driven by lower sales, partially offset by decreased r&d expenses.
kidney care segment operating income was $300 million, $408 million and $488 million for the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. segment operating income decreased in 2023 primarily due to raw materials inflation and higher bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans. segment operating income decreased in 2022 primarily due to raw materials inflation, lower net sales and, to a lesser extent, increased supply chain costs, partially offset by lower bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans and $28 million of incremental revenue from a customer that did not meet its contractual minimum purchase requirements.
other during the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we earned $18 million, $77 million and $59 million, respectively, of operating income that was not attributable to our reportable segments. operating income generated by activities not attributable to our reportable segments is presented as other. in the current and prior year periods, other operating income primarily represents income from revenues earned by certain of our manufacturing facilities from contract manufacturing activities and royalty income under a business development arrangement. the decrease in 2023 as compared to the prior year period reflects lower contract manufacturing volume and the termination of the royalty arrangement following our acquisition of the rights to the underlying product in april 2023. the increase in 2022 as compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by royalty income from a business development arrangement entered into in march 2022.
unallocated corporate costs under our new operating model, most global functional support costs, overhead costs and other shared costs that benefit our segments are allocated to those segments. corporate costs that are not allocated to our segments, as well as any differences between actual corporate costs and the amounts allocated to our segments, are presented as unallocated corporate costs. additionally, intangible asset amortization and other special items are not allocated to our segments. prior to the implementation of our new operating model in the third quarter of 2023, more costs were maintained at corporate and were not allocated to our previous segments. certain of the costs that were previously maintained at corporate under our prior segment structure that are now allocated to our segments include manufacturing variances and centrally managed supply chain costs, certain r&d costs, product category support costs, stock compensation expense and certain employee benefit plan costs.

cash flows from operations - continuing operations in 2023, 2022 and 2021, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $1.70 billion, $1.03 billion and $2.03 billion, respectively.
operating cash flows from continuing operations increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to a decrease in our net loss from continuing operations, lower annual payouts under our employee incentive compensation plans, which were based on our 2022 results, the timing of accounts payable payments and lower increases in inventory and accounts receivable balances as compared to the prior year.
operating cash flows from continuing operations decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to our net loss from continuing operations, increases in inventory levels and higher annual payouts under our employee incentive compensation plans, which were based on our 2021 results. operating cash flows were also adversely impacted in 2022 by the timing of accounts receivable collections and accounts payable payments.
cash flows from investing activities in 2023, cash used for investing activities from continuing operations included capital expenditures of $692 million. in 2022, cash used for investing activities from continuing operations included capital expenditures of $620 million and payments for acquisitions and investments of $263 million, primarily related to our acquisition of the rights to zosyn. in 2021, cash used for investing activities from continuing operations included payments for acquisitions and investments of $10.50 billion, primarily related to our acquisition of hillrom, and capital expenditures of $691 million.
cash flows from financing activities in 2023, cash used in financing activities included debt repayments of $2.63 billion, dividend payments of $586 million and a net decrease in commercial paper borrowings of $299 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock issued under employee benefit plans of $95 million.
in 2022, cash used in financing activities included debt repayments of $954 million and dividend payments of $573 million, partially offset by a net increase in commercial paper borrowings of $55 million and proceeds from stock issued under employee benefit plans of $127 million.
in 2021, cash generated from financing activities included $11.80 billion to fund the consideration for the hillrom acquisition, repay certain indebtedness of hillrom and pay fees and expenses related to the foregoing. we also had net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings of $299 million and repaid debt obligations of $2.82 billion, including $2.40 billion of debt that was assumed in the hillrom acquisition. financing activities in 2021 also included payments for treasury stock repurchases of $600 million, dividend payments of $530 million and receipts from stock issued under employee benefit plans of $187 million.
as authorized by the board of directors, we repurchase our stock depending upon our cash flows, net debt levels and market conditions. in july 2012, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program and the related authorization was subsequently increased a number of times. we did not repurchase any shares under this authority in 2023 and had $1.30 billion remaining available under this authorization as of december 31, 2023.
credit facilities, commercial paper program and access to capital and credit ratings credit facilities and commercial paper program as of december 31, 2023, we had a u.s. dollar-denominated term loan credit facility, which had two tranches of term loans outstanding, a u.s. dollar-denominated revolving credit facility and a euro-denominated revolving credit facility.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $130 million outstanding under one tranche of our u.s. dollar-denominated term loan credit facility that matures in 2024 and $1.64 billion outstanding under the other tranche of our u.s. dollar-denominated term loan credit facility that matures in 2026. borrowings under the term loan credit facility bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either term sofr plus an applicable margin plus a credit spread adjustment or a "base rate" plus an applicable margin. the term loan credit facility contains various covenants, including a maximum net leverage ratio. we have the option to prepay outstanding amounts under the term loan credit facility in whole or in part at any time.
as of december 31, 2023, our u.s. dollar-denominated revolving credit facility and euro-denominated revolving credit facility had a maximum capacity of $2.50 billion and €200 million, respectively, and there were no borrowings under either of these revolving credit facilities as of december, 31, 2023 or december 31, 2022. each of the revolving credit facilities matures in 2026. the revolving credit facilities enable us to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates, and contain various covenants, including a maximum net leverage ratio. facility fees under the credit facilities were 0.125% annually as of both december 31, 2023 and 2022 and are based on our credit ratings and the total capacity of the revolving credit facility.
in the first quarter of 2023, we amended the credit agreements governing our u.s. dollar-denominated term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility and the guaranty agreement with respect to our euro-denominated revolving credit facility, in each case to amend the net leverage ratio covenant to increase the maximum net leverage ratio for the four fiscal quarters ending march 31, 2023, june 30, 2023, september 30, 2023 and december 31, 2023. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in these agreements.
based on our covenant calculations as of december 31, 2023, we have capacity to draw on the full amounts under our revolving credit facilities. the non-performance of any financial institution supporting either of the revolving credit facilities would reduce the maximum capacity of the revolving credit facilities by the institution's respective commitment. additionally, a deterioration in our financial performance may reduce our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities.
we have a commercial paper program that currently enables us to borrow efficiently at short-term interest rates. upon maturity of any commercial paper borrowings under this program, and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. our commercial paper borrowing arrangements require us to maintain undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities for an amount at least equal to our outstanding commercial paper borrowings. if we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the revolving credit facilities; however, electing to do so would result in higher interest expense. we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2023.
we also maintain other credit arrangements, as described in note 6 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
access to capital and credit ratings we intend to fund short-term and long-term obligations as they mature through cash on hand, including the proceeds from the recently completed sale of our bps business, future cash flows from operations, or by issuing additional debt, which could include commercial paper. we had $3.19 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2023, with adequate cash available to meet operating requirements in each jurisdiction in which we operate. we invest our excess cash in money market and other funds and diversify the concentration of cash among different financial institutions. as of december 31, 2023, we had $13.80 billion of long-term debt and finance lease obligations, including current maturities, and no short-term debt. during the fourth quarter of 2023, we used a portion of the approximately $3.70 billion of net after-tax cash proceeds from the bps divestiture to repay $2.80 billion of short- and long-term indebtedness and we expect to use substantially all of the remaining net after-tax proceeds to continue to repay indebtedness through the first half of 2024. subject to market conditions, we regularly evaluate opportunities with respect to our capital structure.
our ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt, including commercial paper, or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products or in the solvency of our customers or suppliers, deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions. however, we believe we have sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support our growth objectives and reduce our post-hillrom acquisition debt levels as we take actions consistent with our capital allocation priorities.
our credit ratings at december 31, 2023 were as follows:

1.interest payments on debt and finance lease obligations are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at the end of 2023. certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on foreign currency fluctuations or other factors or events. the projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at december 31, 2023. refer to note 6 and note 7, respectively, in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion regarding our debt instruments outstanding and finance lease obligations at december 31, 2023.
2.the primary components of other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2023 are pension and other postretirement benefits, deferred tax liabilities, long-term tax liabilities, and litigation and environmental reserves. we projected the timing of the related future cash payments based on contractual maturity dates (where applicable) and estimates of the timing of payments (for liabilities with no contractual maturity dates). the actual timing of payments could differ from our estimates.
we contributed $47 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2023 and 2022. the timing of funding in future periods is uncertain and is dependent on future movements in interest rates, investment returns, changes in laws and regulations, and other variables. therefore, the table above excludes cash outflows related to our pension plans. the amount included within other non-current liabilities (and excluded from the table above) related to our pension plan liabilities was $782 million as of december 31, 2023. we have no obligation to fund our principal plans in the united states in 2024. we continually reassess the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions. in 2024, we expect to make contributions of at least $18 million to our puerto rico plan and $48 million to our foreign pension plans. we expect to have net cash outflows relating to our opeb plans of $17 million in 2024. additionally, we have excluded long-term tax liabilities, which include liabilities for unrecognized tax positions, and deferred tax liabilities from the table above because we are unable to estimate the timing of the related cash outflows. the amounts of long-term tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities included within other non-current liabilities (and excluded from the table above) were $125 million and $447 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2023.
3.includes our significant contractual unconditional purchase obligations. for cancellable agreements, any penalty due upon cancellation is included. these commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business. examples include firm commitments for raw material and component part purchases, utility agreements and service contracts.
off-balance sheet arrangements we periodically enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. certain contingencies arise in the normal course of business and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with u.s. gaap (such as contingent joint development and commercialization arrangement payments). also, upon resolution of uncertainties, we may incur charges in excess of presently established liabilities for certain matters (such as contractual indemnifications). for a discussion of our significant off-balance sheet arrangements, refer to note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information regarding receivable transactions, and note 3 and note 8 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information regarding joint development and commercialization arrangements, indemnifications and legal contingencies.
financial instrument market risk we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates. our hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. refer to note 16 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information regarding our financial instruments and hedging strategies.
currency risk we are primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to revenues generated outside of the united states denominated in the euro, british pound, chinese renminbi, korean won, australian dollar, canadian dollar, japanese yen, colombian peso, brazilian real, mexican peso, indian rupee and swedish krona. we manage our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. in addition, we use derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange. gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. however, we don't hedge our entire foreign exchange exposure and are still subject to earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange risk. financial market and currency volatility may limit our ability to cost-effectively hedge these exposures.
we primarily use forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions and recognized assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. the maximum term over which we have cash flow hedge contracts in place related to foreign exchange risk on forecasted transactions as of december 31, 2023 is 12 months. we also enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign exchange risk on certain intra-company and third-party receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies.
as part of our risk-management program, we perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of our foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible near-term movements in foreign exchange rates.
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2023, while not predictive in nature, indicated that if the u.s. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies, the net pre-tax asset balance of $46 million with respect to those contracts would change by $106 million. a similar analysis performed with respect to contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2022 indicated that, on a pre-tax basis, the net asset balance of $2 million would change by $68 million.
the sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2023 by replacing the actual exchange rates as of december 31, 2023 with exchange rates that are 10% weaker compared to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency. all other factors are held constant. these sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency. the analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances.
in february 2022, the three-year cumulative inflation rate in turkey exceeded 100 percent. as a result, on april 1, 2022, we began reporting the results of our subsidiary in that jurisdiction using highly inflationary accounting, which requires that the functional currency of the entity be changed to the reporting currency of its parent. as of december 31, 2023, our subsidiary in turkey had net monetary assets of $28 million.
interest rate risk we are also exposed to the risk that our earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. our policy is to manage interest costs using the mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt that we believe is appropriate at that time. to manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, we periodically enter into interest rate swaps in which we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. we also periodically use forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt. as of december 31, 2023, there were no interest rate derivative contracts outstanding and we had $2.07 billion of outstanding floating rate debt. a 100 basis point change in interest rates would impact our pre-tax earnings and cash flows by $21 million over a one-year period.
changes in accounting standards refer to note 1 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements.
recent accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in november 2023, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) 2023-07, segment reporting (topic 280): improvements to reportable segment disclosures, which requires enhanced disclosures about segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. this standard is effective for our annual consolidated financial statements for the year ending december 31, 2024 and for interim periods beginning in 2025. we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.
in december 2023, the fasb issued asu 2023-09, income taxes (topic 740): improvement to income tax disclosures, which requires (1) disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. additionally, the amendment requires disclosure of certain disaggregated information about income taxes paid, income from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) and income tax expense (benefit). the standard is effective for our annual consolidated financial statements for the year ending december 31, 2025. we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.
in june 2022, the fasb issued asu 2022-03, fair value measurement of equity securities subject to contractual sales restrictions, which (1) clarifies the guidance in topic 820 on the fair value measurement of an equity security that is subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security and (2) requires specific disclosures related to such an equity security. the standard is effective for our annual consolidated financial statements for the year ending december 31, 2024 and for interim periods beginning in 2025. the impact of the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. certain of our accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are the most important to the depiction of our financial statements and require significant, difficult or complex judgments by us, often employing the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. actual results that differ from our estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our results of operations and financial position. the following is a summary of accounting policies that we consider critical to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition and related provisions and allowances revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration primarily related to rebates and distributor chargebacks. these reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. our estimates take into consideration historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. the amount of variable consideration included in the net sales price is limited to the amount that is probable not to result in a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized in a future period. additionally, our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately and determining the allocation of the transaction price may require significant judgment.
pension and opeb plans we provide pension and other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees. the service component of employee benefit expenses is reported in the same line items in the consolidated income statements as the applicable employee's compensation expense. all other components of these employee benefit expenses are reported in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). the valuation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for the plans is calculated using actuarial assumptions. these assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if appropriate. the significant assumptions include the following:
•interest rates used to discount pension and opeb plan liabilities;
•the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets;
•rates of increase in employee compensation (used in estimating liabilities);
•anticipated future healthcare trend rates (used in estimating the opeb plan liability); and
•other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover (used in estimating liabilities).
selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both short-term and long-term historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation (also called the measurement date). the use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost. actual results in the future could differ from expected results.
our key assumptions are listed in note 13 in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. the most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering u.s. and puerto rico employees, because these plans are the most significant to our consolidated financial statements.
discount rate assumption effective for the december 31, 2023 measurement date, we utilized discount rates of 5.21% and 5.12%, respectively, to measure the benefit obligations for our most significant pension and opeb plans, which cover u.s. and puerto rico employees. we used a broad population of approximately 200 aa-rated corporate bonds as of december 31, 2023 to determine the discount rate assumption. all bonds were denominated in u.s. dollars, with a minimum amount outstanding of $50 million. this population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of approximately 700 moody's aa rated, non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds by eliminating the top 10th percentile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds we would most likely select if we were to actually annuitize our pension and opeb plan liabilities. this portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the u.s. and puerto rico plans. the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve.
for plans in canada, japan, the united kingdom and other european countries, we use a method essentially the same as that described for the u.s. and puerto rico plans. for our other international plans, the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country- and region-specific government and corporate bond interest rates.
to understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and opeb plan cost, we perform a sensitivity analysis. holding all other assumptions constant, for each 50 basis point increase in the discount rate, global pre-tax pension and opeb plan cost would decrease by $7 million, and for each 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate, global pre-tax pension and opeb plan cost would increase by $6 million.
return on plan assets assumption in measuring the net periodic cost for 2023, we used a long-term expected rate of return of 6.50% for our most significant pension plans, which cover u.s. and puerto rico employees. this assumption will increase to 6.75% in 2024. this assumption is not applicable to our opeb plan because it is not funded.
we establish the long-term asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns, both company-specific and relating to the broad market (based on our asset allocation), as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations. the current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both our actual and targeted asset allocation. in calculating net pension cost, the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years. the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future.
to understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost, we perform a sensitivity analysis. holding all other assumptions constant, for each 50 basis point increase (decrease) in the asset return assumption, global pre-tax pension plan cost would decrease (increase) by approximately $15 million.
other assumptions for the u.s. and puerto rico plans, we used the pri-2012 combined mortality table with improvements projected using the mp-2021 projection scale adjusted to a long-term improvement of 0.8% as of december 31, 2023. for all other pension plans, we utilized country- and region-specific mortality tables to calculate the plans' benefit obligations. we periodically analyze and update our assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover, considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends.
the assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience, market trends, and anticipated future company actions.
deferred tax asset valuation allowances and reserves for uncertain tax positions we maintain valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized. changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. the realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future, particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected, or if we take operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary.
in the normal course of business, we are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and are periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due. these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we intend to defend our positions. in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we record reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with u.s. gaap based on the technical support for the positions, our past audit experience with similar situations, and potential interest and penalties related to the matters. our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if, upon final resolution with taxing authorities, we prevail in positions for which reserves have been established, or we are required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.
realization of our u.s. and foreign operating loss and tax credit carryforwards depends on generating sufficient future earnings. a valuation allowance of $658 million and $704 million was recognized as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to reduce the deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards because we do not believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be fully realized prior to expiration. after evaluating relevant u.s. tax laws, any elections or other opportunities that may be available, and the future expiration of certain u.s. tax provisions that will impact the utilization of our u.s. foreign tax credit carryforwards, management expects to be able to realize some, but not all, of the u.s. foreign tax credit deferred tax assets up to its recurring and non-recurring foreign inclusions. therefore, a valuation allowance of $130 million and $119 million was recognized with respect to the foreign tax credit carryforwards as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we will continue to evaluate the need for additional valuation allowances and, as circumstances change, the valuation allowance may change.
impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets goodwill goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value (or other measurement attribute required by u.s. gaap) of acquired assets and liabilities in a business combination. goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment review annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist. we have the option to assess goodwill for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if we determine that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not required to be performed. if we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we do not elect the option to perform an initial qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. in the quantitative impairment test, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount that the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
in a quantitative goodwill impairment test, the fair values of our reporting units are generally determined based on a discounted cash flow model (an income approach) and earnings multiples (a market approach) based on the guideline public company method. significant assumptions used in reporting unit fair value measurements generally include forecasted cash flows, discount rates, terminal growth rates and earnings multiples. the discounted cash flow models used to determine the fair values of our reporting units during 2023 reflected our most recent cash flow projections, discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 9.5% and terminal growth rates ranging from 2.0% to 3.5%. each of these inputs can significantly affect the fair values of our reporting units.
our operating and reportable segments were changed in the third quarter of 2023 to align with our new operating model: medical products and therapies, healthcare systems and technologies (formerly referred to as our hillrom segment), pharmaceuticals and kidney care. as a result of this segment change, we reallocated the goodwill from our previous americas, emea and apac segments to the reporting units within our new medical products and therapies, pharmaceuticals and kidney care segments based on the relative fair values of those reporting units. we performed impairment tests both before and after the reporting unit change and determined that no goodwill impairment had occurred.
upon our segment change in the third quarter of 2023, we initially identified three reporting units within our new kidney care segment: pd, hd and acute therapies. in connection with the ongoing activities related to the proposed separation of our kidney care segment, that business completed an organizational realignment during the fourth quarter of 2023. as a result of that organizational realignment within our kidney care segment, the previous pd and hd reporting units were combined into a single chronic therapies reporting unit. we performed impairment tests of the kidney care reporting units, both before and after the combination of pd and hd into chronic therapies, and determined that no goodwill impairment had occurred.
in connection with our november 1, 2023 annual goodwill impairment tests, we determined that no goodwill impairments had occurred. the fair values of the front line care reporting unit within our healthcare systems and technologies segment and the chronic therapies reporting unit within our kidney care segment exceeded their carrying values by approximately 5% and 6%, respectively. we are continuing to closely monitor the performance of those reporting units, and if there is a significant adverse change in our outlook for those businesses in the future, a goodwill impairment could arise at that time. as of december 31, 2023, the carrying amounts of goodwill for our front line care and chronic therapies reporting units were $2.42 billion and $444 million, respectively.
we acquired hillrom on december 13, 2021 and recognized $6.83 billion of goodwill and $6.03 billion of other intangible assets, including $1.91 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets, in connection with that acquisition. in the second half of 2022, we recognized $2.81 of goodwill impairments related to the reporting units within our hillrom segment (currently referred to as out healthcare systems and technologies segment). as discussed below, we also recognized impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to that business, consisting primarily of trade names.
other long-lived assets other long-lived assets are primarily comprised of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including both indefinite-lived intangible assets and amortizing intangible assets.
indefinite-lived intangible assets indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as ipr&d acquired in business combinations and certain trade names with indefinite lives, are subject to an impairment review annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist. we have the option to assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first performing qualitative assessments to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the carrying amounts. if we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or if we elect not to perform an initial qualitative assessment, we then perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying amount. if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying amount down to the fair value.
in a quantitative indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test, fair values are generally determined based on a discounted cash flow model. significant assumptions used in valuations of indefinite-lived intangible assets include the forecasted cash flows, discount rates, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, the stage in completion (for acquired ipr&d intangible assets), royalty rates, terminal growth rates and contributory asset charges. the relief from royalty models used in the determination of the fair values of our trade name intangible assets during 2023 reflected our most recent revenue projections, a discount rate of 9%, royalty rates ranging from 4% to 5% and terminal growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%. each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset.
as a result of an update to our long-term branding strategy, we reclassified two trade name intangible assets with carrying amounts of $870 million and $21 million from indefinite-lived intangible assets to amortizing intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2023. the estimated useful lives assigned to those assets were 15 years and 5 years, respectively, and we recognized $10 million of amortization expense on those intangible assets from the date of reclassification through december 31, 2023. we performed impairment tests of those intangible assets at the time of the reclassification and determined that no impairment had occurred.
the total carrying amount of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was $837 million as of december 31, 2023, comprised of a trade name intangible asset and ipr&d. we tested our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2023 and determined that no impairment had occurred.
intangible assets with definite lives and property, plant and equipment we review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets used in operations, other than goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. in evaluating recoverability, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level such that the identifiable cash flows relating to the group are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. we then compare the carrying amounts of the assets or asset groups with the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows. in the event an asset (or asset group) is not recoverable, an impairment charge is recorded as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) exceeds its fair value. however, the portion of an impairment loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset within an asset group cannot reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value if its fair value is determinable without undue cost and effort.
our manufacturing facility in opelika, alabama was one of three baxter manufacturing facilities that produced dialyzers used in hemodialysis (hd) treatments. the current competitive environment has increased the global supply of those products and, in connection with our initiatives to streamline our manufacturing footprint and improve our profitability, we made the decision in the second quarter of 2023 to cease production of dialyzers at the opelika facility near the end of 2023. as a result of our decision to cease dialyzer production at this manufacturing facility, we performed a trigger-based recoverability assessment of its long-lived assets, which consist of a building and manufacturing equipment, including specialized equipment used in the production of dialyzers. the carrying amount of that asset group exceeded the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated, and we recognized an impairment charge of $243 million, classified within cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss), during the year ended december 31, 2023 to reduce the carrying amounts to their estimated fair values. the fair values of the building and manufacturing equipment tested for impairment during the second quarter of 2023 were determined based on transaction prices of comparable assets. significant assumptions used in the determination of the fair values included the identification of representative comparable assets.
as discussed above, we identified new reporting units as a result of our segment change in the third quarter of 2023 and performed fair value measurements of our reporting units to reallocate goodwill to the new reporting units based on their relative fair values and to assess those reporting units for impairment.  the hd business within our kidney care segment was initially identified as one of the new reporting units at that time. based on the estimated fair value of our hd business, we allocated no goodwill to it. additionally, we determined that a triggering event was present to review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets within the hd business, which include four manufacturing facilities that primarily manufacture hd products, hd equipment leased to customers under operating leases and developed technology intangible assets, for potential impairment. in connection with that evaluation, we determined that the carrying amount of the asset group represented by our hd business, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities, exceeded its forecasted undiscounted cash flows. we then measured the excess of the carrying amount of that asset group over its fair value and allocated the resulting impairment to its long-lived assets, limiting the impairments of individual assets within the group to amounts that would not result in their carrying amounts being written down below their fair values. as a result, we recognized $267 million of long-lived asset impairment charges, comprised of (i) a $190 million impairment charge related to certain manufacturing equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and hd equipment leased to customers and (ii) a $77 million impairment charge related to developed technology intangible assets.
the fair value of the hd asset group was based on a discounted cash flow model (an income approach). significant assumptions used in the determination of its fair value include forecasted cash flows, discount rates and terminal growth rates. the discounted cash flow model used to determine the fair value of the hd asset group during the third quarter 2023 reflected our most recent cash flow projections, a discount rate of 8% and a terminal growth rate of 1.5%. we also measured the fair values of individual assets within that asset group to ensure that the allocation of the asset group's impairment to the long-lived assets within that group would not reduce the carrying amount of any individual asset below its fair value. the fair values of the buildings within that asset group were determined based on a cost approach. significant assumptions used in the determination of those fair values included replacement costs of assets with a similar age and condition. the fair values of manufacturing equipment and hd equipment leased to customers within that group were determined based on transaction prices of comparable assets. significant assumptions used in the determination of those fair values included the identification of representative comparable assets. the fair value of the right-of-use asset within that group was determined based on market rents and discount rates.
during the third quarter of 2022, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $332 million to reduce the carrying amounts of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily related to the hillrom and welch allyn trade names acquired in the hillrom acquisition, to their estimated fair values. additionally, during 2022 we recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $12 million related to developed technology intangible assets due to declines in market expectations for the related products.
long-lived assets held for sale long-lived assets are classified as held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its present condition and the sale is probable of being completed within one year of the balance sheet date. assets held for sale are no longer depreciated or amortized and they are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
our goodwill and other long-lived asset fair value measurements are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because they involve significant unobservable inputs.
further adverse changes to macroeconomic conditions or our earnings forecasts could lead to additional goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges in future periods and such charges could be material to our results of operations.
certain regulatory matters in july 2017, immediately prior to the closing of our acquisition of claris injectables limited (claris), fda commenced an inspection of the claris' facilities in ahmedabad, india. fda completed the inspection and subsequently issued a warning letter based on observations identified in the 2017 inspection (2017 warning letter).1 fda re-inspected the facilities and issued a form fda 483 on may 17, 2022. on september 1, 2022, fda notified us that the inspection had been classified as voluntary action indicated. from january 19, 2023 to january 27, 2023, fda performed an inspection at the ahmedabad site, concluding with the issuance of a form fda 483. on april 26, 2023, fda notified us that the inspection had been classified as official action indicated. we received a warning letter on july 25, 2023 based on observations identified in the january 2023 inspection (2023 warning letter)2. since the issuance of the 2017 warning letter, we have implemented corrective and preventive actions to address fda's related observations, as well as other enhancements at the site. we have fully responded to the 2023 warning letter, have implemented additional corrective and preventive actions, and continue to engage with fda regarding the agency's observations. in addition, since the issuance of the 2017 warning letter, we have secured other sites in our manufacturing network and have launched and distribute select products from those sites in the u.s.

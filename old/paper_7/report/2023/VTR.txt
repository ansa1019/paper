business summary and overview of 2023
ventas, inc., (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, "we," "us," "our," "company" and other similar terms) an s&p 500 company, is a real estate investment trust ("reit") focused on delivering strong, sustainable shareholder returns by enabling exceptional environments that benefit a large and growing aging population. we hold a portfolio that includes senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings, research centers, hospitals and healthcare facilities located in north america and the united kingdom. as of december 31, 2023, we owned or had investments in approximately 1,400 properties (including properties classified as held for sale). our company is headquartered in chicago, illinois with additional corporate offices in louisville, kentucky and new york, new york.
we elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code (the "code"), commencing with our taxable year ended december 31, 1999. provided we qualify for taxation as a reit, we generally will not be required to pay u.s. federal corporate income taxes on our reit taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. in order to maintain our qualification as a reit, we must satisfy a number of highly technical requirements, which impact how we invest in, operate or manage our assets. see "risk factors-our reit status risks" included in part i, item 1a of this annual report.
we primarily invest in our portfolio of real estate assets through wholly-owned subsidiaries and other co-investment entities. we operate through three reportable business segments: senior housing operating portfolio, which we also refer to as "shop", outpatient medical and research portfolio, which was formerly known as office operations, and triple-net leased properties. non-segment assets consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and miscellaneous accounts receivable as well as investments in unconsolidated entities. in addition, from time to time, we make secured and unsecured loans and other investments relating to real estate or operators. our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each operating segment and determines how to allocate resources to these segments, in significant part, based on noi and related measures for each segment. see our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, including "note 2 - accounting policies" and "note 18 - segment information," included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k (the "annual report"). for a discussion of our definition of noi and for a reconciliation of noi to our net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), see "-non-gaap financial measures."
we also have investments in unconsolidated entities, including through our third-party institutional capital management business, ventas investment management ("vim"). through vim, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles where we are the sponsor or general partner, including our open-ended investment vehicle, the ventas life science & healthcare real estate fund (the "ventas fund"). see "note 7 - investments in unconsolidated entities" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report.
the following table summarizes information for our reportable business segments and non-segment assets for the year ended december 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

______________________________
(1)    "noi" is defined as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third-party capital management expenses. see "non-gaap financial measures" included elsewhere in this annual report for additional disclosure and a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with gaap, to noi.
(2)    noi for non-segment includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses related to our third-party institutional capital management business, income from loans and investments and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments.
we aim to enhance shareholder value by delivering consistent, superior total returns through a strategy of (1) generating reliable and growing cash flows, (2) maintaining a portfolio of high-quality assets that are unified in serving the large and growing aging population and (3) preserving our financial strength, flexibility and liquidity.
our ability to access capital in a timely and cost-effective manner is critical to the success of our business strategy because it affects our ability to satisfy existing obligations, including the repayment of maturing indebtedness, and to make future investments. factors such as general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, expectations of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, and the trading price of our common stock impact our access to and cost of external capital. for that reason, we generally attempt to match the long-term duration of our investments in real property with long-term financing through the issuance of shares of our common stock or the incurrence of long-term fixed rate debt.
2024 market trends our operations have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by economic and market conditions. for instance, in senior housing, our operators have experienced expense pressures, due in part to increased inflation and low unemployment. while there have been signs that expense pressures are moderating, there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case.
we expect senior housing to benefit from strong supply/demand fundamentals, including robust projected demand growth combined with low projected supply growth. senior housing is expected to benefit from a large and growing aging demographic in the united states, with the 80+ population anticipated to grow by more than 24% through 2029. united states senior housing construction starts are at their lowest point since 2009.
continual improvement in the performance and growth of our business will also depend on the broader macroeconomic environment, including interest rates, inflation and gdp growth.
see "risk factors" in part i, item 1a of this annual report for additional discussion of risks affecting our business.
select 2023 and early 2024 highlights investments and dispositions

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report have been prepared in accordance with gaap set forth in the accounting standards codification ("asc"), as published by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb"). gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. we base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. however, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, we may have applied a different accounting treatment, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. we periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe that the critical accounting policies described below, among others, affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. for more information regarding our critical accounting policies, see "note 2 - accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report.
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.
gaap requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities ("vies"). a vie is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; and (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. we consolidate our investment in a vie when we determine that we are its primary beneficiary. we may change our original assessment of a vie upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affects the characteristics or adequacy of the entity's equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary.
we identify the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could be significant to the entity. we perform this analysis on an ongoing basis.
accounting for real estate acquisitions when we acquire real estate, we first make reasonable judgments about whether the transaction involves an asset or a business. our real estate acquisitions are generally accounted for as asset acquisitions as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. we record the cost of the assets acquired as tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based upon their relative fair values as of the acquisition date.
we estimate the fair value of buildings acquired on an as-if-vacant basis or replacement cost basis and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building, generally not to exceed 35 years. we determine the fair value of other fixed assets, such as site improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over the assets' estimated remaining useful lives as determined at the applicable acquisition date. we determine the value of land either by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions or based on internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio. we generally determine the value of construction in progress based upon the replacement cost. however, for certain acquired properties that are part of a ground-up development, we determine fair value by using the same valuation approach as for all other properties and deducting the estimated cost to complete the development. during the remaining construction period, we capitalize project costs until the development has reached substantial completion. construction in progress, including capitalized interest, is not depreciated until the development has reached substantial completion.
intangibles primarily include the value of in-place leases and acquired lease contracts. we include all lease-related intangible assets and liabilities within acquired lease intangibles and accounts payable and other liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.
the fair value of acquired lease-related intangibles, if any, reflects: (i) the estimated value of any above or below market leases, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated market rent and in-place lease rent; and (ii) the estimated value of in-place leases related to the cost to obtain tenants, including leasing commissions, and an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rent and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period as if the acquired space was vacant. we amortize any acquired lease-related intangibles to revenue or amortization expense over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any assumed bargain renewal periods. if a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration or not renewed upon expiration, we recognize all unamortized amounts of lease-related intangibles associated with that lease in operations over the shortened lease term.
we estimate the fair value of purchase option intangible assets and liabilities, if any, by discounting the difference between the applicable property's acquisition date fair value and an estimate of its future option price. we do not amortize the resulting intangible asset or liability over the term of the lease, but rather adjust the recognized value of the asset or liability upon sale.
in connection with an acquisition, we may assume rights and obligations under certain lease agreements pursuant to which we become the lessee of a given property. we generally assume the lease classification previously determined by the prior lessee absent a modification in the assumed lease agreement. we assess assumed operating leases, including ground leases, to determine whether the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable to us given current market conditions on the acquisition date. to the extent the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable to us relative to market conditions on the acquisition date, we recognize an intangible asset or liability at fair value and amortize that asset or liability to interest or rental expense in our consolidated statements of income over the applicable lease term. where we are the lessee, we record the acquisition date values of leases, including any above or below market value, within operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
we estimate the fair value of noncontrolling interests assumed consistent with the manner in which we value all of the underlying assets and liabilities.
we calculate the fair value of long-term assumed debt by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings, which we approximate based on the rate at which we would expect to incur a replacement instrument on the date of acquisition, and recognize any fair value adjustments related to long-term debt as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument.
impairment of long-lived and intangible assets we periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. if indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. in performing this evaluation, we consider market conditions and our current intentions with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. we adjust the net book value of real estate properties and other long-lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows, including sales proceeds, is less than book value. we recognize an impairment loss at the time we make any such determination.
estimates of fair value used in our evaluation of investments in real estate are based upon an income approach, if necessary, or other acceptable valuation techniques that are based, in turn, upon all available evidence including level three inputs, such as net operating income, revenue and expense growth rates, estimates of future cash flows, capitalization rates, discount rates, general economic conditions and trends, or other available market data such as replacement cost or comparable sales. our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and to estimate and determine fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.
accounting for foreclosed properties the company may receive properties pursuant to a foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or other legal action in full or partial settlement of loans receivable by taking legal title or physical possession of the properties. we refer to such actions as a "foreclosure" and to such properties as "foreclosed properties." we account for foreclosed properties received in settlement of loans receivable in accordance with asc 310, receivables. foreclosed real estate received in full or partial satisfaction of a loan and any debt assumed upon foreclosure is recorded at fair value at the time of foreclosure. if the amortized cost basis in the loan exceeds the fair value of the collateral received, the difference is recorded as an allowance on loans receivable and investments in the consolidated statements of income. conversely, if the fair value of the collateral received is higher than the amortized cost basis in the loan, the difference, less the fair value of any debt assumed, less the principal amount of the loan receivable (after the reversal of previously recorded allowances), and net of working capital assumed and transaction costs, is recorded as a gain on foreclosure of real estate in the consolidated statements of income.
recent accounting standards in november 2021, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2021-10, disclosures by business entities about government assistance ("asu 2021-10"), which requires expanded annual disclosures for transactions involving the receipt of government assistance. required disclosures include a description of the nature of the transactions with government entities, our accounting policies for such transactions and their impact to our consolidated financial statements. we adopted asu 2021-10 on january 1, 2022 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in november 2023, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2023-07, segment reporting-improvements to reportable segment disclosures ("asu 2023-07"), which requires incremental disclosures related to a public entity's reportable segments. required disclosures include, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (codm) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount for other segment items (which is the difference between segment revenue less segment expenses and less segment profit or loss) and a description of its composition, the title and position of the codm, and an explanation of how the codm uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. the standard also permits disclosure of more than one measure of segment profit. asu 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2024. we are evaluating the impact of adopting asu 2023-07 on our consolidated financial statements.
in december 2023, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2023-09, improvements to income tax disclosures ("asu 2023-09"), which requires public entities on an annual basis to (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income [or loss] by the applicable statutory income tax rate). asu 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2025. we are evaluating the impact of adopting asu 2023-09 on our consolidated financial statements.
results of operations we operate through three reportable business segments: senior housing operating portfolio, outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties. in our shop segment, we invest in senior housing communities throughout the united states and canada and engage operators to operate those communities. in our outpatient medical and research portfolio segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease and manage outpatient medical buildings and research centers throughout the united states. in our triple-net leased properties segment, we invest in and own senior housing communities, skilled nursing facilities ("snfs"), long-term acute care facilities ("ltacs"), freestanding inpatient rehabilitation facilities ("irfs") and other healthcare facilities throughout the united states and the united kingdom and lease those properties to tenants under triple-net or absolute-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures. information provided for "non-segment" includes income from loans and investments and other miscellaneous income and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments. non-segment assets consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and miscellaneous accounts receivable.
our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each reportable business segment and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, based on noi and related measures for each segment. for further information regarding our reportable business segments and a discussion of our definition of noi, see "note 18 - segment information" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report. see "non-gaap financial measures" included elsewhere in this annual report for additional disclosure and reconciliations of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with gaap, to noi.

resident fees and services include all amounts earned from residents at our senior housing communities, such as rental fees related to resident leases, extended health care fees and other ancillary service income. property-level operating expenses related to our shop segment include labor, food, utilities, marketing, management and other costs of operating the properties. for senior housing communities in our shop segment, occupancy generally reflects average operator-reported unit occupancy for the reporting period. average monthly revenue per occupied room reflects average resident fees and services per operator-reported occupied unit for the reporting period.
the noi increase in our shop segment in 2023 over the prior year was driven by positive trends in revenue driven by gains in occupancy and revenue per occupied room in 2023, communities that converted business model from our triple-net lease properties segment and properties acquired in connection with our equitization of the santerre mezzanine loan. these gains were partially offset by higher property-level operating expenses in 2023, driven by hhs grants received in 2022, which are reflected as a reduction in property-level operating expenses, and macro inflationary impacts primarily on labor in 2023. during 2023, we did not receive any hhs grants. during 2022, hhs grants received reduced property-level operating expenses by $54.2 million.

in our triple-net leased properties segment, our revenues generally consist of fixed rental amounts (subject to contractual escalations) received from our tenants in accordance with the applicable lease terms. we report revenues and property-level operating expenses within our triple-net leased properties segment for real estate tax and insurance expenses that are paid from escrows collected from our tenants.
the increase in our triple-net leased properties noi in 2023 over the prior year was primarily driven by a $29.0 million increase in rental income from properties acquired in connection with our equitization of the santerre mezzanine loan, a $5.1 million increase in contractual rent escalators and $4.5 million of additional rental income received, partially offset by $12.6 million decrease in rental income from communities that converted business model to our senior housing operating portfolio and dispositions.
occupancy rates may affect the profitability of our tenants' operations. for senior housing communities and post-acute properties in our triple-net leased properties segment, occupancy generally reflects average operator-reported unit and bed occupancy, respectively, for the reporting period. because triple-net financials are delivered to us following the reporting period, occupancy is reported in arrears. the following table sets forth average continuing occupancy rates related to the triple-net leased properties we owned at december 31, 2023 and measured over the trailing 12 months ended september 30, 2023 (which is the most recent information available to us from our tenants) and average continuing occupancy rates related to the triple-net leased properties we owned at december 31, 2022 and measured over the 12 months ended september 30, 2022. the table excludes non-stabilized properties, properties owned through investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, certain properties for which we do not receive occupancy information and properties acquired or properties that transitioned operators for which we do not have a full four quarters of occupancy results.

noi - non-segment information provided for non-segment noi includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses, related to our third-party institutional capital management business, income from loans and investments and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments. the $33.5 million decrease in non-segment noi in 2023 over the prior year was primarily due to a $25.2 million decrease in interest income from loans receivable and investments driven by a $22.2 million decrease due to the conversion of the outstanding principal amount of the santerre mezzanine loan to equity in may 2023 and a $5.8 million decrease due to a $43.4 million loan investment that was repaid at par in february 2023, partially offset by $9.9 million of promote revenue earned as general partner of the ventas fund within vim in 2022. see "note 6 - loans receivable and investments" and "note 7 - investments in unconsolidated entities" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report.
company results interest and other income the $7.8 million increase in interest and other income in 2023 over the prior year is primarily due to interest income earned on cash invested in short term money market funds.
interest expense the $106.6 million increase in total interest expense in 2023 over the prior year was primarily attributable to an increase of $69.9 million due to a higher effective interest rate and $29.3 million due to higher average debt balances. our gaap weighted average effective interest rate was 4.23% for 2023, compared to 3.66% for 2022. capitalized interest for 2023 and 2022 was $12.3 million and $9.6 million, respectively.
depreciation and amortization the $194.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2023 over the prior year is primarily due to a $112.3 million increase in impairments recognized in 2023 primarily related to properties that were classified as held for sale or sold and a $72.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to our ownership of additional properties.
general, administrative and professional fees the $4.0 million increase in general, administrative and professional fees in 2023 over the prior year was primarily due to inflationary increases.
gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, net the $6.7 million change in gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, net in 2023 over the prior year was primarily related to $8.3 million of gain recognized as a result of the april 2023 cash tender offers.
transaction, transition and restructuring costs transaction, transition and restructuring costs include transition and integration expenses incurred by properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions; costs and expenses relating to mergers, acquisitions, investments, leases, management agreements and similar arrangements, strategic transactions, such as spin-offs, joint ventures, partnerships and minority investments, and other transactions; and costs and expenses related to organizational or other restructuring activities. the $15.7 million decrease in transaction, transition and restructuring costs in 2023 over the prior year was primarily due to a $7.3 million decrease in restructuring charges incurred in 2022 in connection with the departure of an executive leadership team member and a $6.7 million decrease in transition costs incurred in 2022 in connection with properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions.
allowance on loans receivable and investments the $40.0 million change in allowance on loans receivable and investments was primarily due to a $20.0 million allowance recognized in 2022 on the santerre mezzanine loan. in connection with our equitization of the santerre mezzanine loan on may 1, 2023, we reversed the $20.0 million allowance previously recorded. as a result, the santerre mezzanine loan is no longer outstanding.
gain on foreclosure of real estate the gain of $29.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 was recorded in connection with our equitization of the santerre mezzanine loan on may 1, 2023 and is the excess of the fair value of the properties that secured the santerre mezzanine loan, less the fair value of the chc mortgage loan, less the principal amount of the santerre mezzanine loan on may 1, 2023 (after the reversal of previously recorded allowances), and net of non-real estate assets and liabilities and transaction costs.
shareholder relations matters shareholder relations matters of $20.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 relates to proxy advisory costs related to our response to a proxy campaign associated with the company's 2022 annual meeting. there were no such costs incurred for the year ended december 31, 2023.
other income (expense)
other expense includes the changes in fair value of stock warrants, net expenses or recoveries related to materially disruptive events and other expenses or income. the $81.3 million change in other income (expense) in 2023 over the prior year is primarily due to a $60.9 million change in the fair value of stock warrants received in connection with the brookdale lease. as of december 31, 2023, the fair value of the stock warrants was $59.3 million, which was $31.2 million higher than the fair value at the grant date. in 2023, we also recognized a $21.0 million increase in other income relating to insurance reimbursements received, net of expenses, for damage caused by materially disruptive events, primarily the winter storm elliott.
income from unconsolidated entities the $14.9 million decrease in income from unconsolidated entities for 2023 over the prior year was primarily due to a $26.1 million gain on sale recognized in 2022 in connection with atria combining its proprietary cloud-based senior housing management software platform, glennis, with two other complementary companies in the software as a service (saas) technology space, a $11.7 million net gain on real estate disposition recognized in 2022 by ardent and our share of higher net loss from the research & innovation development joint venture in 2023 due to higher interest expense and higher depreciation for development assets placed in service, partially offset by a $33.5 million gain recognized in may 2023 upon the sale of approximately 24% of our 9.8% ownership interest in ardent to a third-party investor.
gain on real estate dispositions the $54.3 million increase in gain on real estate dispositions was due to the higher disposition volume in 2023, which resulted in a net gain of $62.1 million recognized in 2023 for the sale of 26 properties and two land parcels compared to a net gain of $7.8 million in 2022 for the sale of 13 properties and a vacant land parcel.
income tax benefit the 2023 income tax benefit is primarily due to losses in certain of our trs entities and a $3.2 million benefit from internal restructurings of u.s. trs entities. the 2022 income tax benefit is primarily due to income tax benefit from operating losses at certain trs entities and an income tax benefit of $11.9 million from an internal restructuring of foreign trs entities.
years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021
our annual report for the year ended december 31, 2022, filed with the sec on february 10, 2023, contains information regarding our results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 and the effect of changes in those results from period to period on our net income attributable to common stockholders.
non-gaap financial measures we consider certain non-gaap financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. a non-gaap financial measure is a measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not so excluded from or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with u.s. gaap. described below are the non-gaap financial measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance and that we consider most useful to investors, together with reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures.
the non-gaap financial measures we present in this annual report may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. you should not consider these measures as alternatives for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap. in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, you should examine these measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable gaap measures as presented in our consolidated financial statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this annual report.
funds from operations and normalized funds from operations attributable to common stockholders historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. however, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. for that reason, we consider funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo") and normalized ffo to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity reit. we believe that the presentation of ffo, combined with the presentation of required gaap financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful. management generally considers ffo to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), ffo can help investors compare the operating performance of a company's real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. we believe that normalized ffo is useful because it allows investors, analysts and our management to compare our operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies across periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. in some cases, we provide information about identified non-cash components of ffo and normalized ffo because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess the impact of those items on our financial results.
we use the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") definition of ffo. nareit defines ffo as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with gaap) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests will be calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis. we define normalized ffo as nareit ffo excluding the following income and expense items, without duplication: (a) transaction, transition and restructuring costs and amortization of intangibles; (b) the impact of expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of our debt; (c) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, the non-cash impact of changes to our executive equity compensation plan, derivative transactions that have non-cash mark-to-market impacts on our consolidated statements of income and non-cash charges related to leases; (d) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (e) gains and losses for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (f) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other items related to unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests; (g) net expenses or recoveries related to materially disruptive events; and (h) other items set forth in the normalized ffo reconciliation included herein.
the following table summarizes our ffo and normalized ffo for the three years ended december 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands). normalized ffo for the year ended december 31, 2022 includes $54.2 million of hhs grants received in 2022, which reduced property-level operating expenses, and $9.9 million of promote revenue earned as general partner of the ventas life science & healthcare real estate fund within vim. excluding hhs grants, normalized ffo for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased net operating income at our shop segment as a result of positive trends in revenue driven by gains in occupancy and revenue per occupied room, partially offset by higher property-level operating expenses and higher interest expense.

noi we also consider noi an important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess our unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results with those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis. we define noi as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses.

see "results of operations" for discussions regarding both noi and same-store noi. we define same-store as properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that we may include selected properties that otherwise meet the same-store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in our judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of our segment performance.
newly acquired development properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties in our shop reportable business segment will be included in same-store once they are stabilized for the full period in both periods presented. these properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement of 80% sustained occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. recently developed or redeveloped properties in our outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments will be included in same-store once substantial completion of work has occurred for the full period in both periods presented. our senior housing operating portfolio and triple-net leased properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in same-store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods presented.
properties are excluded from same-store if they are: (i) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with gaap; (ii) impacted by materially disruptive events such as flood or fire; (iii) for shop, those properties that are currently undergoing a materially disruptive redevelopment; (iv) for our outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those properties for which management has an intention to institute, or has instituted, a redevelopment plan because the properties may require major property-level expenditures to maximize value, increase noi, or maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization, most commonly as the result of an expected or actual material change in occupancy or noi; or (v) for shop and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those properties that are scheduled to undergo operator or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business models after the start of the prior comparison period.
to eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements, all portfolio performance-based disclosures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period's results are shown in actual reported usd, while prior comparison period's results are adjusted and converted to usd based on the average exchange rate for the current period.
asset/liability management asset/liability management, a key element of enterprise risk management, is designed to support the achievement of our business strategy, while ensuring that we maintain appropriate and tolerable levels of market risk (primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk) and credit risk. effective management of these risks is a contributing factor to the absolute levels and variability of our ffo and net worth. the following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments.
market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our unsecured term loans, certain of our mortgage loans that are floating rate obligations, mortgage loans receivable that bear interest at floating rates and available for sale securities. these market risks result primarily from changes in sofr rates or prime rates. to manage these risks, we continuously monitor our level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including our assessment of current and future economic conditions. see "risk factors-we are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective." included in part i, item 1a of this annual report.

the variable rate debt in the table above reflects, in part, the effect of $142.7 million notional amount of interest rate swaps maturing on march 22, 2027, in each case that effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. in addition, the fixed rate debt in the table above reflects, in part, the effect of $527.3 million and c$651.5 million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities ranging from february 2025 to april 2031, in each case that effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. see "note 10 - senior notes payable and other debt" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report.
the increase in our fixed rate debt from december 31, 2022 to december 31, 2023 was primarily due to the issuance of $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2026, the issuance of a $426.8 million fixed rate mortgage loan, which accrues interest at 5.91%, matures in 2033 and is secured by 19 shop communities in the united states, and interest rate swap activity in 2023 effectively converting an incremental $200.0 million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt.
the decrease in our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31, 2023 compared to december 31, 2022 is primarily attributable to pay downs on commercial paper.
assuming a 100 basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate related to our variable rate debt and assuming no change in our variable rate debt outstanding as of december 31, 2023 of $1.1 billion, interest expense on an annualized basis would increase by approximately $11.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share.
as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, our joint venture partners' aggregate share of total consolidated debt was $297.5 million and $279.0 million, respectively, with respect to certain properties we owned through consolidated joint ventures.
total consolidated debt does not include our portion of unconsolidated debt related to investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, which was $575.3 million and $454.4 million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
the fair value of our fixed rate debt is based on current market interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings. increases in market interest rates typically result in a decrease in the fair value of fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates typically result in an increase in the fair value of fixed rate date. while changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt, these changes do not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt. therefore, interest rate risk does not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt obligations until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing. if interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt, whether at maturity or otherwise, our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs. conversely, lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs.
to highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points in interest rates (dollars in thousands):

as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of our secured and non-mortgage loans receivable, based on our estimates of currently prevailing rates for comparable loans, was $53.1 million and $517.0 million, respectively. see "note 6 - loans receivable and investments" and "note 11 - fair values of financial instruments" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report.
as a result of our canadian and united kingdom operations, we are subject to fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may, from time to time, affect our financial condition and operating performance. based solely on our results for the year ended december 31, 2023 (including the impact of existing hedging arrangements), if the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the british pound and canadian dollar were to increase or decrease by one standard deviation compared to the average exchange rate during the year, our normalized ffo per share for the year ended december 31, 2023 would decrease or increase, as applicable, by less than $0.01 per share or 1%. we will continue to mitigate these risks through a layered approach to hedging looking out for the next year and continual assessment of our foreign operational capital structure. nevertheless, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have an effect on our earnings.
concentration risk we use concentration ratios to identify, understand and evaluate the potential impact of economic downturns and other adverse events that may affect our asset types, geographic locations, business models, and tenants, operators and managers. we evaluate concentration risk in terms of investment mix and operations mix. investment mix measures the percentage of our investments that is concentrated in a specific asset type or that is operated or managed by a particular tenant, operator or manager. operations mix measures the percentage of our operating results that is attributed to a particular tenant, operator or manager, geographic location or business model.

we derive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with escalators, subject to certain limitations. some of our triple-net lease escalators are contingent upon the satisfaction of specified facility revenue parameters or based on increases in the consumer price index ("cpi"), with caps, floors or collars. we also earn revenues directly from individual residents in our senior housing communities that are managed by operators, such as atria and sunrise, and tenants in our outpatient medical buildings.
the concentration of our triple-net leased properties segment revenues and operating income that are attributed to brookdale, ardent and kindred creates credit risk. if any of brookdale, ardent or kindred becomes unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations to us or to renew its leases with us upon expiration of the terms thereof, our financial condition and results of operations could decline, and our ability to service our indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders could be impaired. see "risk factors-risks related to our business operations and strategy-a significant portion of our revenues and operating income is dependent on a limited number of tenants and managers, including brookdale, ardent, kindred, atria and sunrise." included in part i, item 1a of this annual report and "note 3 - concentration of credit risk" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report.
we regularly monitor and assess any changes in the relative credit risk associated with our significant tenant relationships. the ratios and metrics we use to evaluate the relative credit risk associated with those relationships depend on facts and circumstances specific to that relationship and may vary over time. such ratios and metrics may include, without limitation, the credit history of, and the legal, regulatory or economic conditions affecting, any tenant, guarantor, obligor, or affiliated company associated with the tenant. among other things, we may review and analyze information regarding the real estate, senior housing and healthcare industries generally, financial statements and other public or private information regarding any tenant, guarantor, obligor, or affiliated company. from time to time we may also participate in discussions and in-person meetings with representatives of the significant tenant. using this information, we calculate and review multiple financial ratios (which may, but do not necessarily, include, leverage, fixed charge coverage, rent coverage and other property level key performance indicators), including certain adjustments based on information provided by the tenant or required by the relevant reporting requirements and the expected future performance of the assets, tenants and guarantors.
because atria and sunrise manage our properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee from us, we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of our managers in the same manner or to the same extent as our triple-net tenants. however, we rely on our managers' personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively. we also rely on atria and sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financials results in a timely manner and otherwise operate our senior housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, including various rights to terminate and exercise remedies under the agreements as provided therein, atria's or sunrise's failure, inability or unwillingness to satisfy its respective obligations under those agreements, to efficiently and effectively manage our properties or to provide timely and accurate accounting information with respect thereto could have a material adverse effect on us. see "risk factors-risks related to our business operations and strategy" included in part i, item 1a of this annual report.
we hold a 34% ownership interest in atria, which entitles us to customary minority rights and protections, including the right to appoint two members to the atria board of directors.
triple-net lease performance and expirations any failure, inability or unwillingness by our tenants to satisfy their obligations under our triple-net leases could have a material adverse effect on us. also, if our tenants are not able or willing to renew our triple-net leases upon expiration, we may be unable to reposition the applicable properties on a timely basis or on the same or better economic terms, if at all. although our lease expirations are staggered, the non-renewal of some or all of our triple-net leases that expire in any given year could have a material adverse effect on us. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we had no triple-net lease renewals or expirations without renewal that, in the aggregate, had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations for that period. see "risk factors-risks related to our business operations and strategy-if we need to replace any of our tenants or managers, we may be unable to do so on as favorable terms, if at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations." included in part i, item ia of this annual report.
the following table summarizes our lease expirations in our triple-net leased properties segment currently scheduled to occur over the next 10 years as of december 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

(2)abr represents the annualized impact of the current period's cash base rent at 100% share for consolidated entities. abr does not include common area maintenance charges, the amortization of above/below market lease intangibles or other noncash items. abr is used only for the purpose of determining lease expirations.
(3)includes 29 ltacs leased by kindred and 121 senior living properties leased by brookdale. kindred may extend the term for 5 years by delivering a renewal notice to the company 12 to 18 months prior to expiration. brookdale may extend the term for 10 years by delivering a renewal notice to the company 13 to 18 months prior to expiration. we cannot assure you that kindred or brookdale will exercise its renewal option for these properties. see "risk factors-risks related to our business operations and strategy-if we need to replace any of our tenants or managers, we may be unable to do so on as favorable terms, if at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations." included in part i, item 1a of this annual report.
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, and proceeds from asset sales.
for the next 12 months, our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund operating expenses; (ii) meet our debt service requirements; (iii) repay maturing mortgage and other debt; (iv) fund acquisitions, investments and commitments and any development and redevelopment activities; (v) fund capital expenditures; and (vi) make distributions to our stockholders and unitholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a reit. depending upon the availability of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash. we expect that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by a combination of the following: cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt assumptions and financings (including secured financings), issuances of debt and equity securities, dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program. however, an inability to access liquidity through multiple capital sources concurrently could have a material adverse effect on us.
our material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, and operating obligations which include ground lease obligations. during the year ended december 31, 2023, our contractual obligations increased primarily due to the issuance of $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2026. see "note 10 - senior notes payable and other debt" and "note 14 - commitments and contingencies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report for further information regarding our long-term debt obligations and operating obligations, respectively.
we may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding indebtedness for cash or in exchange for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, prospects for capital and other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
loans receivable and investments on may 1, 2023, we took ownership of the properties that secured the santerre mezzanine loan by converting the outstanding principal amount of the santerre mezzanine loan to equity, with no additional consideration being paid. as a result, the santerre mezzanine loan is no longer outstanding.
credit facilities, commercial paper, unsecured term loans and letters of credit as of december 31, 2023, we had $2.7 billion of undrawn capacity on our unsecured revolving credit facility with $14.0 million outstanding and an additional $1.2 million restricted to support outstanding letters of credit. we limit our use of the unsecured revolving credit facility, to the extent necessary, to support our commercial paper program when commercial paper notes are outstanding.
our wholly-owned subsidiary, ventas realty, limited partnership ("ventas realty"), may issue from time to time unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.0 billion. the notes are sold under customary terms in the u.s. commercial paper note market and are ranked pari passu with all of ventas realty's other unsecured senior indebtedness. the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ventas, inc. as of december 31, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program.
ventas realty has a $500.0 million unsecured term loan priced at term sofr plus 0.95%, which is subject to adjustment based on ventas realty's debt ratings. this term loan is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ventas, inc. it matures in june 2027 and includes an accordion feature that permits ventas realty to increase the aggregate borrowings thereunder to up to $1.25 billion, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the receipt of additional commitments for such increase.
on september 6, 2023, ventas realty entered into a $200.0 million unsecured term loan priced at sofr plus 0.95%, which is subject to adjustment based on ventas realty's debt ratings. this term loan is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ventas, inc. it matures in february 2027 and includes an accordion feature that permits ventas realty to increase the aggregate borrowings thereunder to up to $500.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the receipt of additional commitments for such increase.
as of december 31, 2023, ventas canada finance limited ("ventas canada") and ventas ssl ontario ii, inc., as borrowers, had a c$500 million or $377.5 million unsecured term loan facility priced at canadian dollar offered rate ("cdor") plus 0.90% that matures in january 2025.
as of december 31, 2023, our $100.0 million uncommitted line for standby letters of credit had an outstanding balance of $15.0 million. the agreement governing the line contains certain customary covenants and, under its terms, we are required to pay a commission on each outstanding letter of credit at a fixed rate.
exchangeable senior notes in june 2023, ventas realty issued $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2026 (the "exchangeable notes") in a private placement. the exchangeable notes are senior, unsecured obligations of ventas realty and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by ventas. the exchangeable notes bear interest at a rate of 3.75% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year, beginning on december 1, 2023. the exchangeable notes mature on june 1, 2026, unless earlier exchanged, redeemed or repurchased. the net proceeds from the exchangeable notes were primarily used to repay the chc mortgage loan. as of december 31, 2023, we had $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of the exchangeable notes outstanding. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recognized approximately $17.8 million of contractual interest expense and amortization of issuance costs of $3.6 million related to the exchangeable notes. unamortized issuance costs were $17.1 million as of december 31, 2023.
the exchangeable notes are exchangeable at an initial exchange rate of 18.2460 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of exchangeable notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $54.81 per share of common stock). the initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment, including in the event of the payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of $0.45 per share, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. upon exchange of the exchangeable notes, ventas realty will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the exchangeable notes to be exchanged and pay or deliver (or cause to be delivered), as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at ventas realty's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the exchangeable notes being exchanged. prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding march 1, 2026, the exchangeable notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods described in the indenture governing the exchangeable notes. on or after march 1, 2026, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, the exchangeable notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders at any time regardless of these conditions or periods.
senior notes as of december 31, 2023, we had outstanding $8.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by ventas realty, approximately $73.8 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by nationwide health properties, inc. ("nhp") and assumed by our subsidiary, nationwide health properties, llc ("nhp llc"), as successor to nhp, in connection with our acquisition of nhp, and c$1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by our subsidiary, ventas canada. all of the senior notes issued by ventas realty and ventas canada are unconditionally guaranteed by ventas, inc.
we may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding senior notes for cash or in exchange for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, prospects for capital and other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes require us to comply with various financial and other restrictive covenants. we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december 31, 2023.
in april 2023, our 100% owned subsidiary, ventas canada, issued and sold c$600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.398% senior notes due 2028 in a private placement at par. pursuant to cash tender offers, we used the proceeds to repurchase c$613.7 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes due in 2024 for an aggregate purchase price of c$600.0 million plus accrued and unpaid interest as disclosed below:
•in april 2023, we repurchased c$527.0 million principal amount of our 2.80% senior notes, series e due april 2024 at 97.6% of par value, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the settlement date.
•in april 2023, we repurchased c$86.7 million principal amount of our 4.125% senior notes, series b due september 2024 at 98.5% of par value, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the settlement date.
as a result of the tender offers, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $8.3 million in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2023.
mortgages at december 31, 2023, our consolidated aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding was $3.2 billion, of which our share was $2.9 billion.
under certain circumstances, contractual and legal restrictions, including those contained in the instruments governing our subsidiaries' outstanding mortgage indebtedness, may restrict our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations, including our payment guarantees with respect to ventas realty's and ventas canada finance limited's senior notes.
in march 2023, we entered into a c$271.8 million floating rate mortgage loan maturing in 2028 with an interest rate of cdor + 0.88%. the mortgage is secured by 14 shop communities in canada.
on may 1, 2023, we took ownership of the properties that supported the santerre mezzanine loan by converting the outstanding principal amount of the santerre mezzanine loan to equity, with no additional consideration being paid. the properties consisted of a diverse pool of 153 assets, which, at the time, also secured the chc mortgage loan. at the time of the equitization of the santerre mezzanine loan, there was $1 billion outstanding under the chc mortgage loan and it accrued interest at a weighted average rate of libor + 1.84% and matured on june 9, 2023. the chc mortgage loan was recorded at fair value, which approximates par, on may 1, 2023. between june and august 2023, we repaid in full the chc mortgage loan.
in july 2023, we entered into a $426.8 million fixed rate mortgage loan, which accrues interest at 5.91%, matures in 2033 and is secured by 19 shop communities in the united states. in october 2023, we purchased a $32.0 million tranche of this company indebtedness at a discounted price, reducing the net effective interest rate of the mortgage loan to 5.60% and the net amount of the mortgage loan to $394.8 million.
in december 2023, we entered into a c$93.5 million floating rate mortgage loan maturing in 2028 with an interest rate of corra + 1.31%. the mortgage is secured by five shop communities in canada.
derivatives and hedging in the normal course of our business, interest rate fluctuations affect future cash flows under our variable rate debt obligations, loans receivable and marketable debt securities, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our operating results. we follow established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative instruments, to mitigate the impact of these risks.
in the first quarter of 2023, we hedged an incremental $200.0 million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt through the execution in march 2023 of two-year $400.0 million notional swaps on our unsecured term loan due in june 2027, replacing a $200.0 million notional swap that matured in january 2023. the swap instruments are designated as cash flow hedges.
in march 2023, in connection with our new c$271.8 million mortgage loan, we entered into an interest rate swap totaling a notional amount of c$271.8 million with a maturity of march 14, 2028 that effectively converts cdor-based floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.
in march and april 2023, we entered into a total of $250.0 million aggregate forward starting swaps with a ten-year weighted average rate of 3.37%. in july 2023, we terminated the above-mentioned forward starting swaps in conjunction with the issuance of the $426.8 million fixed rate mortgage loan due in 2033.
in december 2023, in connection with our new c$93.5 million mortgage loan, we entered into an interest rate swap totaling a notional amount of c$93.5 million with a maturity of december 18, 2028 that effectively converts cdor-based floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.
dividends during 2023, we declared four dividends totaling $1.80 per share of our common stock, including a fourth quarter dividend of $0.45 per share. in order to continue to qualify as a reit, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of our reit taxable income (excluding net capital gain). in addition, we will be subject to income tax at the regular corporate rate to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income, including any net capital gains. we intend to pay dividends greater than 100% of our taxable income, after the use of any net operating loss carryforwards, for 2024.
we expect that our cash flows will exceed our reit taxable income due to depreciation and other non-cash deductions in computing reit taxable income and that we will be able to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. however, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to meet this requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. if we do not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements or any combination of the foregoing.
capital expenditures the terms of our triple-net leases generally obligate our tenants to pay all capital expenditures necessary to maintain and improve our triple-net leased properties. however, from time to time, we may fund the capital expenditures for our triple-net leased properties through loans or advances to the tenants, which may increase the amount of rent payable with respect to the properties in certain cases. we may also fund capital expenditures for which we may become responsible upon expiration of our triple-net leases or in the event that our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under those leases. we also expect to fund capital expenditures related to our shop and outpatient medical and research portfolio segments with the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings. we expect that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by a combination of the following: cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt assumptions and financings (including secured financings), issuances of debt and equity securities, dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program.
to the extent that unanticipated capital expenditure needs arise or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. our ability to borrow additional funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness.
we are party to certain agreements that obligate us to develop senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings or research centers funded through capital that we and, in certain circumstances, our joint venture partners provide. as of december 31, 2023, we had six active and committed projects pursuant to these agreements, including three projects that are unconsolidated.
in addition, from time to time, we engage in redevelopment projects with respect to our existing senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings and research centers to maximize the value, increase noi, maintain a market-competitive position, achieve property stabilization or change the primary use of the property.
equity offerings we participate in an "at-the-market" equity offering program ("atm program"), pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell up to $1.0 billion aggregate gross sales price of shares of our common stock. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we sold 2.3 million shares of our common stock under our atm program for gross proceeds of $110.4 million, representing an average price of $47.89 per share. there were no issuances under the atm program for the year ended december 31, 2022. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we sold 10.9 million shares of our common stock under our previous atm program for gross proceeds of $626.4 million at an average gross price of $57.71 per share. as of december 31, 2023, the remaining amount available under our atm program for future sales of common stock was $889.6 million.
cash flows the following table sets forth our sources and uses of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in thousands):

nm-not meaningful cash flows from operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $0.3 million during 2023 over 2022 primarily due to an increase in noi across our three segments (primarily driven by our shop segment) in 2023 offset by higher interest expense in 2023 and the fact that $54.2 million of hhs grants received in 2022 did not re-occur in 2023.
cash flows from investing activities cash flows used in investing activities decreased $674.6 million during 2023 over 2022 primarily due to fewer external acquisitions and higher proceeds from real estate dispositions in 2023, partially offset by increased capital investment in our portfolio.
cash flows from financing activities cash flows used in financing activities increased $259.8 million during 2023 over 2022 primarily due to higher debt repayments and higher repayments under our commercial paper program in 2023, partially offset by higher proceeds from debt issuances.
off-balance sheet arrangements we own interests in certain unconsolidated entities as described in "note 7 - investments in unconsolidated entities." except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable. in addition, we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under "note 10 - senior notes payable and other debt" to the consolidated financial statements. our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. further, we use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposure. finally, at december 31, 2023, we had $16.2 million outstanding letters of credit obligations. we have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described above.
guarantor and issuer financial information ventas, inc. has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligation to pay principal and interest with respect to the outstanding senior notes, including the exchangeable notes, issued by our 100% owned subsidiary, ventas realty. none of our other subsidiaries is obligated with respect to ventas realty's outstanding senior notes.

in connection with the acquisition of nhp, our 100% owned subsidiary nhp llc, as successor to nhp, assumed the obligation to pay principal and interest with respect to the outstanding senior notes issued by nhp. neither we nor any of our subsidiaries (other than nhp llc) is obligated with respect to any of nhp llc's outstanding senior notes.
in addition, ventas, inc. has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations under our $2.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, our c$500 million unsecured term loan facility, our $500.0 million unsecured term loan, our $200.0 million unsecured term loan and our $100.0 million uncommitted line for standby letters of credit.
under certain circumstances, contractual and legal restrictions, including those contained in the instruments governing our subsidiaries' outstanding mortgage indebtedness, may restrict our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations, including our payment guarantees with respect to ventas realty's and ventas canada's senior notes.

item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this md&a should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
intersegment sales background as previously disclosed, the company received a voluntary document request from the sec relating to intersegment sales between the company's nutrition reporting segment and the company's ag services and oilseeds and carbohydrate solutions reporting segments. in response, the company engaged external counsel, assisted by a forensic accounting firm, to conduct an internal investigation, overseen by the audit committee of the company's board of directors, which is separately advised by external counsel (the "investigation"). as previously disclosed on january 21, 2024, the company placed vikram luthar, chief financial officer and senior vice president, on administrative leave. as of the date of filing, mr. luthar is no longer with the company.
restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements as described in the explanatory note above and in part ii, item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the company has restated its consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2023 and 2022 and for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 contained in this amendment. as a result, the previously reported financial information as of december 31, 2023 and 2022 and for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 in this item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, has been updated to reflect the relevant restatements. see part ii, item 8, note 1. summary of significant accounting policies and restatement of previously filed consolidated financial statements, note 17. segment and geographic information, and note 21. quarterly financial data (unaudited), in the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the restatements, including descriptions of the adjustments and the impacts on the consolidated financial statements.
the company also is correcting certain segment disclosure presentation errors. in this amendment, the company is revising its reconciliation and calculation of total segment operating profit. the revised reconciliation in note 17. segment and geographic information, and elsewhere in this amendment, presents a subtotal for total segment operating profit that is equal to the sum of the segment operating profit reported for each of the ag services and oilseeds, carbohydrate solutions and nutrition segments. amounts for other business and specified items, which previously were reflected in the calculation of total segment operating profit, are now reflected as reconciling items, similar to corporate, between total segment operating profit and earnings before income taxes.
in addition, because the investigation covers the period between january 2018 and september 2023, the company is providing below information with respect to the adjustments effected to operating profit for each of the company's reporting segments for each of the years ended december 31, 2018 through 2023.

sustainability is a key driver in adm's expanding portfolio of environmentally responsible, plant-derived products. consumers today increasingly expect their food and drink to come from sustainable ingredients, produced by companies that share their values, and adm is continually finding new ways to meet those needs through its portfolio actions.
the company's strategic transformation is focused on three strategic pillars: productivity, innovation, and culture.
the productivity pillar includes (1) partnering across various global teams including procurement, supply chain, operations, and commercial to optimize costs and improve production volumes across the enterprise; (2) continued roll out of the 1adm business transformation program and implementation of improved standardized business processes; and (3) increased use of technology, data analytics, and automation at production facilities, in offices, and with customers to improve efficiencies and customer service.
the innovation pillar includes expansions and investments in (1) improving the customer experience by leveraging producer relationships and enhancing the use of state-of-the-art digital technology; (2) sustainability-driven innovation, which encompasses the full range of products, solutions, capabilities, and commitments to serve customers' needs; and (3) growth initiatives, including organic growth with additional capacity to meet growing market demand and strategic objectives.
the culture pillar focuses on building capabilities and enabling collaboration, teamwork, and agility from process standardization and digitalization and adm's diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, which bring new perspectives and expertise to the company's decision-making.
adm plans to support the three pillars with investments in technology, which include expanding digital capabilities and investing further in research and development.
operating performance indicators the company's ag services and oilseeds operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials. as a result, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold. therefore, changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit. thus, gross margins per volume or metric ton are more meaningful than gross margins as percentage of revenues.
the company's carbohydrate solutions operations and nutrition businesses also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. however, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold. therefore, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit. thus, gross margin rates are more meaningful as a performance indicator in these businesses.
the company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 70 countries.  for the majority of the company's subsidiaries located outside the united states, the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in switzerland where euro is the functional currency, and brazil and argentina where u.s. dollar is the functional currency. revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into u.s. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. for the majority of the company's business activities in brazil and argentina, the functional currency is the u.s. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency. changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the euro, british pound, canadian dollar, and brazilian real, as compared to the u.s. dollar.
item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, gross margins, constant currency revenue and operating profit, segment operating profit, total segment operating profit, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (ebitda), adjusted ebitda, manufacturing expenses, selling, general, and administrative expenses, return on invested capital, economic value added, and operating cash flows before working capital. the company's financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, trade policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. due to these unpredictable factors, the company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
operations in ukraine and russia adm employs approximately 630 people in ukraine and operates an oilseeds crushing plant, a grain port terminal, inland and river silos, and a trading office. the company's footprint in russia is limited to operations related to the production and transport of essential food commodities and ingredients.
while the company's ukraine and russian operations have historically represented 0.1% of consolidated revenues, the direct and indirect impacts of the ongoing military action could negatively affect adm's future operating results. the conflict in ukraine has created disruptions in global supply chains and has created dislocations of key agricultural commodities. the indirect impact of these dislocations on the company's operating results will be a function of a number of variables including supply and demand responses from the rest of the world as well as the length of the conflict and the condition of the agricultural industry and export infrastructure after the conflict ends. the black sea grain initiative, an agreement that allowed ukraine to export grain and other food products, expired on july 17, 2023. in september 2023, a new alternative shipping corridor in the black sea took effect with ukraine setting up temporary routes from ports in greater odessa. for more information, refer to part i, item 1a, "risk factors".
as of december 31, 2023, adm's assets in ukraine consisted primarily of current assets that were less than 1% of the company's total current assets and an immaterial amount of non-current assets. of the total current assets in ukraine, the majority were related to inventories that represented less than 2% of adm's total inventories.
market factors influencing operations or results in the twelve months ended december 31, 2023
the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company's operating results. in ag services and oilseeds, supply has been impacted by market dislocations driven by geopolitical uncertainty, record brazil soybean production, and extreme drought conditions in argentina. inflationary pressures impacted the entire value chain. crushing was positively impacted by sustainable biofuel demand and protein consumption around the globe. in refined products and other, margins were driven by strong oil demand and elevated oil prices that were supported by biofuels demand, driven by favorable blend economics as historically low distillate fuel oil inventory drove diesel prices to all-time highs. mediocre growth in mandated renewable volume obligations for 2023 to 2025 drove further market volatility. in carbohydrate solutions, demand for starches and sweeteners remained solid with stronger overall margins due to specialty products pricing. lower gasoline prices in 2023 were supportive of higher domestic gasoline consumption and ethanol demand. strong ethanol exports helped balance overall supply and demand and were supported by discretionary blending at export markets. in nutrition, demand was softer in a few food and beverage product categories. human nutrition was impacted by inflation which drove lower demand especially in higher priced product categories in the food, beverage, and dietary supplement segment and impacted volumes in flavors, flavor systems, emulsifiers, bioactives, and alternative proteins. in animal nutrition, overall market remained weak with pressured farm gate prices in china and structurally decreasing european production. certain tailwinds, however, including softening raw material prices, predominantly in micro ingredients, and recovery in global poultry production helped offset the negative impacts. the amino acids market continued to be subdued with ample supply from china.
year ended december 31, 2023 compared to year ended december 31, 2022
earnings before income taxes decreased 18% or $939 million, to $4.3 billion. total segment operating profit (a non-gaap measure) decreased 9% or $613 million, to $5.9 billion, due primarily to lower results in crushing, wilmar, nutrition, ag services, and starches and sweeteners, partially offset by higher results in refined products and other and vantage corn processors. lower margins partially offset by improved pricing and positive timing impacts, overall decline in volume, higher manufacturing costs, and unplanned downtime at decatur east decreased total segment operating profit (a non-gaap item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
measure). total segment operating profit (a non-gaap measure) excluded a net charge of $344 million consisting of asset impairment and restructuring charges and net settlement contingencies totaling $361 million and a gain on the sale of certain assets of $17 million. total segment operating profit (a non-gaap measure) excluded in the prior year a net charge of $100 million consisting of charges totaling $147 million related to the impairment of certain assets, restructuring, and contingencies/settlements, partially offset by gains on the sale of certain assets of $47 million. corporate results in the current year were a net charge of $1.6 billion and included a mark-to-market gain of $6 million on the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in august 2020, acquisition-related expenses of $7 million, and restructuring charges of $6 million. corporate results in the prior year were a net charge of $1.3 billion and included a mark-to-market gain of $9 million on the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in august 2020.
income taxes of $828 million decreased $40 million. the company's effective tax rate for 2023 was 19.3% compared to 16.6% for 2022. the change in the rate was due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings.
analysis of statements of earnings processed volumes by product for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in metric tons):
(in thousands)                2023   2022                          change oilseeds                34,899                   32,952        1,947

the company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. the overall increase in oilseeds processed volumes was primarily related to improved crush rates in the current year compared to decreased crush rates in the prior year resulting from the decline in global demand for rapeseed and the decline in canola crop due to the drought condition in north america. the overall decrease in corn processed volumes was related to unplanned downtime from plants in decatur, illinois and due to the earthquake in turkey and fire at the cedar rapids, iowa dry mill.

revenues and cost of products sold in agricultural merchandising and processing businesses are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes. in periods of significant changes in market prices, the underlying performance of the company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in ag services and oilseeds, generally have a relatively equal impact from market price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.
revenues decreased $7.6 billion to $93.9 billion due to lower sales prices ($10.3 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes ($2.7 billion). lower sales prices of oils, soybeans, corn, biodiesel, and farming materials and lower sales volumes of corn, were partially offset by higher sales volumes of soybeans and biodiesel. ag services and oilseeds revenues decreased 8% to $73.4 billion due to lower sales prices ($10.1 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes ($4.0 billion). carbohydrate solutions revenues decreased 8% to $12.9 billion due to lower sales prices ($0.6 billion) and lower sales volumes ($0.5 billion). nutrition revenues decreased 6% to $7.2 billion due to lower sales volumes ($0.8 billion), partially offset by higher sales prices ($0.4 billion).
cost of products sold decreased $7.6 billion to $86.4 billion due principally to lower average commodity costs partially offset by higher volumes and increased manufacturing expenses. manufacturing expenses increased $0.3 billion due to individually insignificant increases in various expense categories.
foreign currency translation impacts increased revenues by $0.1 billion and cost of goods sold by $0.1 billion with no impact to gross profit.
gross profit decreased $0.1 billion or 1%, to $7.5 billion due to lower results in crushing ($273 million), nutrition ($232 million) and ag services ($68 million), partially offset by higher results in refined products and other ($431 million) and carbohydrate solutions ($46 million). these factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 41.
item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 3% to $3.5 billion due principally to higher salaries and benefit costs, increased expenses for contracted outside labor, and higher professional and financing fees, partially offset by lower provisions for bad debt.
asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs increased $276 million to $342 million. charges in the current year consisted of $137 million of impairments related to goodwill in the animal nutrition reporting unit, $108 million of impairments related to property, plant, and equipment and an equity method investment, $64 million of impairments related to customer list and discontinued animal nutrition trademarks, and $27 million of restructuring, presented as specified items, and $6 million of restructuring in corporate. charges in the prior year consisted of $37 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets and $28 million of restructuring, presented as specified items, and $1 million of restructuring in corporate.

interest and investment income increased $206 million to $499 million due primarily to higher interest rates, partially offset by revaluation losses of $76 million compared to revaluation gains of $37 million in the prior year.
interest expense increased $251 million to $647 million due primarily to increased short-term rates on customer deposit balances in adm investor services and on the company's commercial paper borrowing programs and increased interest expense from a new debt issuance at a higher rate. interest expense in the current year also included a $6 million mark-to-market gain adjustment related to the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in august 2020 compared to a $9 million mark-to-market gain adjustment in the prior year.
other income - net of $176 million decreased $182 million. current year income included net gains on disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business of $38 million, the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $18 million, net foreign exchange gains of $85 million, and net other income. prior year income included a legal recovery of $110 million related to the 2020 and 2019 closure of the company's export facility in reserve, louisiana, net foreign exchange gains of $105 million, a $50 million payment from the usda biofuel producer recovery program, gains on disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business of $78 million, and the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $25 million, partially offset by net other expense.

ag services and oilseeds segment operating profit decreased 8%. in ag services, significantly higher origination volumes and margins in south america due to a record brazilian soybean crop were mostly offset by decreased north american origination results from lower export demand and low water levels. destination marketing, global ocean freight, and transportation results decreased due to less favorable timing effects and higher freight rates. current year results also included a $48 million insurance settlement related to damages from hurricane ida compared to the prior year's $110 million legal recovery related to the 2019 and 2020 closure of the company's reserve, louisiana, export facility. in crushing, global crush margins were historically strong, yet lower than the prior year's record highs with the lower argentine soybean crop driving a tight soybean meal supply, partially offset by improved processed volumes. in emea, lower meal demand and exports were offset by the switch capacity in the region. in refined products and other, increasing global demand for fuel and food created elevated margins in north america and europe for refined oils and biodiesel. in north america, sales volumes were also higher supported by u.s. renewable volume obligations and margins for food oil in europe expanding year-over-year. additionally, net positive mark-to-market timing effects that are expected to reverse as contracts execute in future periods contributed to the results in the current year. equity earnings from wilmar were lower versus the prior year.
carbohydrate solutions segment operating profit decreased 3%. starches and sweeteners, including ethanol production from the wet mills, capitalized on a solid demand environment during the year. north america starches and sweeteners delivered volumes and margins similar to the prior year with higher margins led by specialty products. ethanol margins were solid as industry stocks moderated, though lower relative to the prior year. results were negatively impacted due to unplanned downtime at one of the corn germ plants. in emea, the business effectively managed margins to deliver improved results. the global wheat milling business posted higher margins driven by solid customer demand. vantage corn processors results

were higher as the business executed on a robust demand and margin environment for ethanol partially offset by the absence of the prior year's $50 million payment from the usda biofuel producer recovery program.
nutrition segment operating profit decreased 36%. human nutrition results were lower than the prior year, as the business continued to manage demand fulfillment challenges and destocking in certain categories. flavors results were lower than the prior year driven by softer sales, higher expenses, and $45 million of negative impacts primarily related to the deconsolidation and write-down of a joint venture. specialty ingredients results were lower year-over-year due to continued lower market demand for plant-based proteins in meat alternatives and unplanned downtime at decatur east. health and wellness results were lower than the prior year due to a revaluation loss of $19 million related to an investment in precision fermentation, partially offset by continued growth in the biotics category. animal nutrition results were lower compared to the prior year due to lower contribution from amino acids, pockets of softer global feed demand affecting volumes, and continued supply chain challenges and inventory losses in pet solutions.
other business operating profit increased 125%. higher interest rates drove improved earnings in adm investor services. captive insurance results improved on premiums from new programs, partially offset by increased claim settlements.

corporate results were a net charge of $1.6 billion in the current year compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. interest expense-net increased $98 million due primarily to increased short-term rates on the company's commercial paper borrowing programs and increased interest expense from a new debt issuance at a higher rate. unallocated corporate costs increased $118 million due primarily to higher financing, information technology, and centers of excellence costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense accruals and higher corporate cost allocation. gain on debt conversion option was related to the mark-to-market adjustment of the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in august 2020. other income in the current year included the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $18 million and foreign exchange gains, partially offset by investment revaluation losses of $57 million and railroad maintenance expenses of $67 million. other income in the prior year included investment revaluation gains of $37 million, the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $25 million, and foreign exchange gains, partially offset by railroad maintenance expenses of $67 million.
non-gaap financial measures the company uses adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share (eps), adjusted ebitda, and total segment operating profit, non-gaap financial measures as defined by the sec, to evaluate the company's financial performance. these performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, gaap financial measures.
adjusted net earnings is defined as net earnings adjusted for the effects on net earnings of specified items. adjusted eps is defined as diluted eps adjusted for the effects on reported diluted eps of specified items. ebitda is defined as earnings before interest on borrowings, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for specified items. the company calculates adjusted ebitda by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of income tax expense, interest expense on borrowings, and depreciation and amortization to net earnings. total segment operating profit is defined as adm's consolidated earnings before income taxes, adjusted for other business, corporate, and specified items. the table on page 41 provides a reconciliation of total segment operating profit to earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.

item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
in this amendment, the company is revising its reconciliation and calculation of total segment operating profit. the revised reconciliation in note 17. segment and geographic information, of the consolidated financial statements, presents a subtotal for total segment operating profit that is equal to the sum of the segment operating profit reported for each of the ag services and oilseeds, carbohydrate solutions and nutrition segments. amounts for other business and specified items, which previously were reflected in the calculation of total segment operating profit, are now reflected as reconciling items, similar to corporate, between total segment operating profit and earnings before income taxes.
management believes that adjusted net earnings, adjusted eps, adjusted ebitda, and total segment operating profit are useful measures of the company's performance because they provide investors additional information about the company's operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. adjusted net earnings, adjusted eps, adjusted ebitda, and total segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to net earnings, diluted eps, net earnings, and earnings before income taxes, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under gaap.

the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company's operating results. in ag services and oilseeds, strong global demand continued due to a short crop in south america. the conflict in ukraine resulted in even tighter global stocks of commodities and created high volatility, which had a positive impact on north and south american origination prices. global trade results were driven by market disconnects, tight supply, strong destination marketing margins, and firm ocean freight rates. north american origination was negatively impacted by weather-related supply disruption and delayed planting and lower river levels. crushing margins continued to benefit from strong protein and renewable diesel demand and tight oilseeds stocks. in refined products and other, margins were driven by strong oil demand and tight supply with volatile energy markets driving up biodiesel margins. in carbohydrate solutions, demand for starches and sweeteners was solid with margins remaining steady despite higher input costs. ethanol demand for domestic gasoline was lower, in part due to high gas prices, while export demand remained strong, driven by favorable blending economics and government incentives. corn milling margins benefited from strong co-product results, as prices for oil and feed products rose in line with higher underlying corn prices. corn costs were volatile and higher, in part due to a relatively low projected corn stocks-to-use ratio and uncertainty caused by the conflict in ukraine. nutrition benefited from overall strong demand in various food, beverage, and dietary supplement categories. in human nutrition, demand for flavors, flavor systems, specialty proteins, bioactives, and fibers was strong, but higher energy, transportation, and raw material costs, and a strong u.s. dollar adversely impacted results. in animal nutrition, amino acids pricing and margins improved due to a tighter global supply environment but the devaluation of certain currencies, a bird flu outbreak, and weak demand in other product lines, with some premix and additives customers cutting products out of formulation due to increased ingredient, freight, and energy costs, adversely impacted results. increased competition in brazil also contributed to the weak demand in that country. adm's productivity initiatives are improving the company's capabilities to help mitigate the impact of inflation.
year ended december 31, 2022 compared to year ended december 31, 2021
earnings before income taxes increased 58% or $1.9 billion, to $5.2 billion. total segment operating profit (a non-gaap measure) increased 37% or $1.7 billion, to $6.5 billion due primarily to higher results in most businesses except in vantage corn processors. total segment operating profit (a non-gaap measure) excluded a net charge of $100 million consisting of charges totaling $147 million related to the impairment of certain assets, restructuring, and contingencies/settlements, partially offset by gains on the sale of certain assets of $47 million. excluded from total segment operating profit (a non-gaap measure) in the prior year was a net charge of $136 million consisting of charges totaling $213 million related to the impairment of certain assets, restructuring, and settlement, partially offset by gains on the sale of ethanol and certain other assets of $77 million. corporate results in 2022 were a net charge of $1.3 billion and included a mark-to-market gain of $9 million on the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in august 2020. corporate results in 2021 were a net charge of $1.3 billion and included a pension settlement charge of $83 million, loss on debt extinguishment of $36 million, a mark-to-market gain of $19 million on the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in august 2020, acquisition-related expenses of $7 million, and a restructuring charge of $4 million.
income taxes of $868 million increased $290 million. the company's effective tax rate for 2022 was 16.6% compared to 17.4% for 2021. the change in the rate was due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings and the impact of discrete tax items.
analysis of statements of earnings processed volumes by product for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows (in metric tons):

item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. the overall decrease in oilseeds processed volumes was primarily related to decreased crush rates resulting from the decline in seeds availability, a temporarily idled facility in paraguay due to crop failure, weather-related challenges, and the indefinite shutdown of a ukraine facility since february 2022. the overall decrease in corn processed volumes was primarily related to reduced volumes of fuel alcohol due to market conditions, the sale of the peoria, illinois facility in november 2021, and logistical challenges surrounding railcar availability since the second quarter of 2022.

revenues and cost of products sold in agricultural merchandising and processing businesses are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes. in periods of significant changes in market prices, the underlying performance of the company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in ag services and oilseeds, generally have a relatively equal impact from market price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.
revenues increased $16.3 billion to $101.6 billion due to higher sales prices ($17.1 billion), partially offset by lower sales volumes ($0.8 billion). higher sales prices of corn, wheat, oil, soybean, and meal, and higher sales volumes of rice, flavors, biodiesel, and corn, were partially offset by lower sales prices of rice and flavors, and lower sales volumes of wheat and oil. ag services and oilseeds revenues increased 19% to $79.6 billion due to higher sales prices ($14.3 billion), partially offset by lower sales volumes ($1.8 billion). carbohydrate solutions revenues increased 26% to $14.0 billion due to higher sales prices ($2.6 billion) and higher sales volumes ($0.3 billion), despite the loss of usd-grade industrial alcohol volumes from the divested peoria, illinois facility. nutrition revenues increased 14% to $7.6 billion due to higher sales prices ($0.2 billion) and higher sales volumes ($0.7 billion).
cost of products sold increased $14.7 billion to $94.0 billion due principally to higher average commodity costs and higher manufacturing expenses. manufacturing expenses increased $0.9 billion to $7.0 billion due principally to higher energy costs, higher maintenance expenses, increased operating supplies, and higher salaries and benefit costs.
item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
foreign currency translation impacts decreased revenues by $2.6 billion and cost of products sold by $2.4 billion.
gross profit increased $1.6 billion or 26%, to $7.6 billion due to higher results in ag services and oilseeds ($1.3 billion), starches and sweeteners ($477 million), and nutrition ($149 million), partially offset by lower results in vantage corn processors ($352 million). these factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 47.
selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 12% to $3.4 billion due principally to provisions for bad debt, higher it and project-related expenses, higher salaries and benefit costs, increased travel expenses, and amortization of intangibles from new acquisitions.
asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs decreased $98 million to $66 million. charges in the current year consisted of $37 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets and $28 million of restructuring charges, presented as specified items, and $1 million of restructuring charges in corporate. charges in the prior year consisted primarily of $125 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets and $35 million of restructuring charges, presented as specified items, and $4 million of restructuring charges in corporate.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $237 million to $832 million due to higher earnings from the company's investments in wilmar and olenex.
loss on debt extinguishment in the prior year of $36 million was related to the early redemption of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.750% notes due in march 2025.
interest and investment income increased $197 million to $293 million due primarily to higher interest income, partially offset by lower revaluation gains of $37 million compared to $49 million in the prior period.
interest expense increased $131 million to $396 million due to higher long-term debt balances and increased short-term rates on the company's u.s. and european commercial paper borrowing programs. interest expense in 2022 also included a $9 million mark-to-market gain adjustment related to the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in august 2020 compared to a $19 million mark-to-market gain adjustment in 2021.
other income - net of $358 million increased $264 million. income in 2022 included a legal recovery related to the 2019 and 2020 closure of the company's reserve, louisiana, export facility of $110 million, net foreign exchange gains of $105 million, a $50 million one-time payment from the usda biofuel producer recovery program, gains on disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, and the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $25 million, partially offset by other net expense. income in 2021 included gains on the sale of ethanol and certain other assets and disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, net foreign exchange gains of $24 million, the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $33 million, and other income, partially offset by a non-cash pension settlement charge of $83 million related to the purchase of group annuity contracts that irrevocably transferred the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for certain salaried and hourly retirees and terminated vested participants under the company's adm retirement plan and adm pension plan for hourly-wage employees.

ag services and oilseeds segment operating profit increased 57%. ag services results were significantly higher versus 2021. global trade results were higher, driven by strong performances in destination marketing and global ocean freight. north american origination volumes were lower but margins were higher year-over-year. south america results were higher, driven by better origination margins on good demand for grain. crushing was higher year-over-year driven by robust protein and renewable diesel demand. positive net timing effects in 2022 versus negative timing effects in 2021 helped drive higher year-over-year results. refined products and other results were higher than in 2021, driven by higher margins due to strong oils demand. biodiesel margins also benefited from direct sales compared to the historical auction sales. equity earnings from wilmar were higher versus 2021.
carbohydrate solutions segment operating profit increased 7%. starches and sweeteners, including ethanol production from the wet mills, delivered higher results versus 2021, driven by solid margins across sweeteners and starches, strong contributions from corn co-products, and effective risk management, partially offset by weaker ethanol margins. sales volumes for starches and sweeteners continued their recovery and the biosolutions platform continued to deliver revenue growth as demand for plant-based products expanded into more diverse applications. vantage corn processors results were lower versus 2021 as ethanol margins decreased from the 2021 strong positioning gains and industrial alcohol results from the now-sold peoria, illinois facility, partially offset by the $50 million one-time payment from the usda biofuel producer recovery program.
nutrition segment operating profit increased 6%. human nutrition delivered higher year-over-year results. flavors results were lower driven by demand fulfillment challenges, the impact of the strong u.s. dollar in emea, softer demand in asia item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
pacific, and higher costs in north america. strong sales growth in alternative proteins, including contribution from the sojaprotein acquisition, and good demand for texturants offset some higher operating costs to help deliver better year-over-year results in specialty ingredients. health and wellness was also higher year-over-year, powered by probiotics, including the contribution from the november 2021 deerland probiotics and enzymes acquisition, and robust demand for fiber and vitamin e. animal nutrition profits were comparable to 2021.
other business operating profit increased 568%. higher short-term interest rates drove improved earnings in adm investor services and improved underwriting performance resulted in better captive insurance results.

corporate results were a net charge of $1.3 billion in 2022 compared to $1.3 billion in 2021. interest expense-net increased $56 million due primarily to higher long-term debt balances and increased average rates on the company's u.s. and european commercial paper borrowing programs. unallocated corporate costs increased $69 million due primarily to higher it and project-related costs and higher costs in the company's centers of excellence, partially offset by lower incentive compensation accruals. loss on debt extinguishment in 2021 related to the early redemption of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.750% notes due in march 2025. gain on debt conversion option was related to the mark-to-market adjustment of the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in august 2020. restructuring and settlement charges in 2021 included a non-cash pension settlement charge of $83 million related to the purchase of group annuity contracts that irrevocably transferred the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for certain salaried and hourly retirees and terminated vested participants under the company's adm retirement plan and adm pension plan for hourly-wage employees to independent third parties, and individually insignificant restructuring charges. other income in 2022 included investment revaluation gains of $37 million, the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $25 million, and foreign exchange gains from hedge activity, partially offset by railroad maintenance expenses of $67 million. other income in 2021 included investment revaluation gains of $49 million, the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $16 million, and foreign exchange gains from hedge activity, partially offset by railroad maintenance expenses of $67 million.
non-gaap financial measures the company uses adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share (eps), adjusted ebitda, and total segment operating profit, non-gaap financial measures as defined by the sec, to evaluate the company's financial performance. these performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, gaap financial measures.
adjusted net earnings is defined as net earnings adjusted for the effects on net earnings of specified items. adjusted eps is defined as diluted eps adjusted for the effects on reported diluted eps of specified items. ebitda is defined as earnings before interest on borrowings, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for specified items. the company calculates adjusted ebitda by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of income tax expense, interest expense on borrowings, and depreciation and amortization to net earnings. total segment operating profit is defined as adm's consolidated earnings before income taxes, adjusted for other business, corporate, and specified items. the table on page 47 provides a reconciliation of total segment operating profit to earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021.
item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
in this amendment, the company is revising its reconciliation and calculation of total segment operating profit. the revised reconciliation in note 17. segment and geographic information, of the consolidated financial statements, and elsewhere in this amendment, presents a subtotal for total segment operating profit that is equal to the sum of the segment operating profit reported for ag services and oilseeds, carbohydrate solutions and nutrition segments. amounts for other business and specified items, which previously were reflected in the calculation of total segment operating profit, are now reflected as reconciling items, similar to corporate, between total segment operating profit and earnings before income taxes.
management believes that adjusted net earnings, adjusted eps, adjusted ebitda, and total segment operating profit are useful measures of the company's performance because they provide investors additional information about the company's operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. adjusted net earnings, adjusted eps, adjusted ebitda, and total segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to net earnings, diluted eps, net earnings, and earnings before income taxes, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under gaap.

item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
liquidity and capital resources a company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business.  the company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of adm's control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures. the primary source of funds to finance adm's operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility and accounts receivable securitization programs.  in addition, the company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both u.s. and international markets.
cash provided by operating activities was $4.5 billion in 2023 compared to $3.5 billion in 2022. working capital changes decreased cash by $0.3 billion in the current year compared to a decrease of $1.5 billion in the prior year. segregated investments increased $0.2 billion driven by higher interest rates. trade receivables decreased $0.7 billion due to lower revenues. inventories decreased $2.9 billion due to lower inventory prices and volumes. trade payables decreased $1.5 billion due to lower payables related to grain and other inventory purchases. payables to brokerage customers decreased $2.1 billion due to decreased trading activity in the company's futures commission and brokerage business.
cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion this year compared to $1.4 billion last year. capital expenditures in the current year were $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. proceeds from sales of assets and businesses were $60 million in the current year compared to $131 million in the prior year. there were no additional cost method investments in the current year compared to $0.2 billion in the prior year.
cash used in financing activities was $4.6 billion this year compared to $2.5 billion last year. long-term debt borrowings in the current year of $0.5 billion consisted of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% notes due 2033. long-term debt borrowings in the prior year of $0.8 billion consisted of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.900% notes due 2032. proceeds from the borrowings in the current year were used for general corporate purposes. proceeds from the borrowings in the prior year were used to finance investments and expenditures in eligible green projects that contribute to environmental objectives and/or eligible social projects that aim to address or mitigate a specific social issue and/or seek to achieve positive social outcomes. long-term debt payments in the current year of $1.0 billion consisted of the €600 million aggregate principal amount of 1.750% notes due 2023 and $300 million aggregate principal amount of zero coupon exchangeable bonds due 2023. long-term debt payments in the prior year of $0.5 billion consisted of the €0.5 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2022 issued in a private placement on march 25, 2021. net payments on short-term credit arrangements of $0.4 billion in the current year was comparable to $0.4 billion to the prior year. share repurchases in the current year were $2.7 billion compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year. dividends paid in the current year were $1.0 billion compared to $0.9 billion in the prior year.
at december 31, 2023, adm had $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.6 to 1.  included in working capital is $7.0 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories.  at december 31, 2023, the company's capital resources included shareholders' equity of $24.1 billion and lines of credit, including the accounts receivable securitization programs described below, totaling $13.2 billion, of which $11.5 billion was unused.  adm's ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt of $8.3 billion and shareholders' equity of $24.1 billion in 2023 and the sum of long-term debt of $7.7 billion and shareholders' equity of $24.3 billion in 2022) was 25% and 24% at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the company uses this ratio as a measure of adm's long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility.  the company's ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt of $0.1 billion, current maturities of long-term debt of $1 million, and long-term debt of $8.3 billion less the sum of cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion and short-term marketable securities of none in 2023 and the sum of short-term debt of $0.5 billion, current maturities of long-term debt of $0.9 billion, and long-term debt of $7.7 billion less the sum of cash and cash equivalents of $1.0 billion and short-term marketable securities of none in 2022) to capital (the sum of net debt of $7.0 billion and shareholders' equity of $24.1 billion in 2023 and the sum of net debt of $8.1 billion and shareholders' equity of $24.3 billion in 2022) was 22% and 25% at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  of the company's total lines of credit, $5.0 billion supported the commercial paper borrowing programs, against which there was $5 million commercial paper outstanding at december 31, 2023.
as of december 31, 2023, the company had $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $0.5 billion of which is cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. based on the company's historical item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its u.s. operations and unused and available u.s. credit capacity of $6.8 billion, the company has asserted these funds are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s.
the company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the "programs") with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. the programs provide the company with up to $3.0 billion in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the programs and expand the company's access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see note 19 in item 8 for more information and disclosures on the programs). as of december 31, 2023, the company utilized $1.6 billion of its facility under the programs.
on november 5, 2014, the company's board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to 100,000,000 shares of the company's common stock during the period commencing january 1, 2015 and ending december 31, 2019. on august 7, 2019, the company's board of directors approved the extension of the stock repurchase program through december 31, 2024 and the repurchase of up to an additional 100,000,000 shares under the extended program. the company has acquired approximately 148.0 million shares under this program and its extension as of december 31, 2023.
as of december 31, 2023, the company has total available liquidity of $12.9 billion comprised of cash and cash equivalents and unused lines of credit.
in 2024, the company expects capital expenditures of $1.3 billion and additional cash outlays of approximately $1.0 billion in dividends and up to $2.3 billion in share repurchases, subject to other strategic uses of capital and the evolution of operating cash flows and the working capital position throughout the year.
the company's purchase obligations as of december 31, 2023 and 2022 were $14.0 billion and $15.8 billion, respectively. the decrease is primarily related to a decrease in obligations to purchase agricultural commodity inventories, partially offset by an increase in energy commitments. as of december 31, 2023, the company expects to make payments related to purchase obligations of $13.4 billion within the next twelve months. the company's other material cash requirements within the next 12 months include current maturities of long-term debt of $1 million, interest payments of $0.4 billion, operating lease payments of $0.3 billion, transition tax liability of $49 million, and pension and other postretirement plan contributions of $114 million. the company expects to make payments related to purchase obligations and other material cash requirements beyond the next twelve months of $16.8 billion.
the company's credit facilities and certain debentures require the company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements.  the company was in compliance with these covenants as of december 31, 2023.
as of december 31, 2023, the three major credit rating agencies maintained the company's credit ratings at investment grade levels. subsequent to december 31, 2023, the company's ratings were placed "on credit watch" and "ratings under review" by two of the credit rating agencies.
critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the company's assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses.  these estimates and judgments are based on the company's historical experience and management's knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  certain of the company's accounting policies and estimates are considered critical, as these policies and estimates are important to the depiction of the company's financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management.  critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with gaap which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on adm's financial condition and results of operations. management has discussed with the company's audit committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies and estimates.  following are the accounting policies and estimates management considers critical to the company's financial statements.
item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
fair value measurements - inventories and commodity derivatives description: certain of the company's inventory, inventory-related payables, and commodity derivative assets and liabilities as of december 31, 2023 are valued at estimated fair values, including $7.0 billion of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, $1.4 billion of commodity derivative assets, $1.0 billion of commodity derivative liabilities, and $1.3 billion of inventory-related payables.  commodity derivative assets and liabilities include forward purchase and sales contracts for agricultural commodities. merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing.
judgments and uncertainties: management estimates fair value for its commodity-related assets and liabilities based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets.  the company's inventory, inventory-related payables, and commodity derivative fair value measurements are mainly based on observable market quotations without significant adjustments and are therefore reported as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  level 3 fair value measurements of approximately $3.4 billion of assets and $0.6 billion of liabilities represent fair value estimates where unobservable price components represent 10% or more of the total fair value price.  for more information concerning amounts reported as level 3, see note 4 in item 8.
sensitivity of estimate to change: changes in the market values of these inventories and commodity contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  if management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported could differ materially.  additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods could differ materially.
derivatives - designated hedging activities description: the company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the purchase or sales price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month. see note 5 in item 8 for additional information.
judgments and uncertainties: assuming normal market conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.
sensitivity of estimate to change: gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  if it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter (otc) option contracts would be recorded immediately in the statement of earnings as a component of revenues and/or cost of products sold.
income taxes description: the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting standards which prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements. deferred taxes are recognized for the estimated taxes ultimately payable or recoverable based on enacted tax law. changes in enacted tax rates are reflected in the tax provision as they occur.
judgments and uncertainties: adm calculates its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to the company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. the company uses judgment in evaluating the company's tax positions and determining its annual tax provision.
item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
sensitivity of estimate to change: while adm considers all of its tax positions fully supportable, the company faces challenges from u.s. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. the company recognizes a tax position in its consolidated financial statements when it is determined to be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on its technical merits. the position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. for example, the company has received tax assessments from tax authorities in the netherlands challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the company. the company evaluated its tax positions for these matters and concluded, based in part upon advice from legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize the tax benefits of these positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits (see note 13 in item 8 for additional information).
business combinations description: the company's acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards codification (asc) topic 805, business combinations, as amended. the consideration transferred is allocated to various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual allocated to goodwill. the company accounts for any redeemable noncontrolling interest in temporary equity - redeemable noncontrolling interest at redemption value with periodic changes recorded in retained earnings.
judgments and uncertainties: fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. these estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. the estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trademarks, and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models. estimates in the discounted cash flow models include, but are not limited to, certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates). these significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.
sensitivity of estimate to change: during the measurement period, which may take up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and related allocations. upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any such adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings.
goodwill description: goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests.  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on october 1 or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.  the company has seven reporting units with goodwill identified at one level below the operating segment using the criteria in asc 350, intangibles - goodwill and other (topic 350).
judgments and uncertainties: the company adopted the provisions of topic 350, which permits, but does not require, a company to qualitatively assess indicators of a reporting unit's fair value. if after completing the qualitative assessment, the company believes it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired, an estimate of fair value is prepared by the company. critical estimates in the determination of the fair value, when using a discounted cash flow analysis, of each reporting unit include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, revenue growth, ebitda margins, and discount rates. these calculations contain uncertainties as they require management to make assumptions including, but not limited to, future expected cash flows of the reporting units utilizing appropriate revenue growth, ebitda margins, and discount rate. a decline in the actual cash flows of the reporting units in future periods, as compared to the projected cash flows used in the discounted cash flow analysis, could result in the carrying value of the reporting units exceeding their respective fair values. further, a change in the discount rate, as a result of a change in economic conditions or otherwise, could result in the carrying values of the reporting units exceeding their respective fair values.
sensitivity of estimate to change: during the year ended december 31, 2023, the company evaluated goodwill for impairment using a qualitative assessment in five reporting units and using a quantitative assessment in two reporting units.
item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $137 million related to the animal nutrition reporting unit that was evaluated for impairment using a quantitative assessment during the year ended december 31, 2023. the company utilized a third-party valuation specialist to assist management in determining the fair value of the animal nutrition reporting unit. the fair value of the animal nutrition reporting unit was estimated based on a combination of discounted cash flows (income approach) and the use of pricing multiples derived from an analysis of comparable public companies multiplied against historical and or anticipated financial metrics (market approach). as a result of this impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2023, the company determined the fair value of the animal nutrition reporting unit was below its carrying value. the decline in the fair value of the animal nutrition reporting unit was primarily driven by a higher discount rate due to changes in the underlying business performance and industry conditions as well as the macroeconomic environment, causing a decline in the projected cash flows. during the first three quarters of 2023, animal nutrition's business performance and industry conditions gradually declined despite management's ongoing mitigation and efficiency improvement actions. given animal nutrition's significant excess in fair value over carrying value in prior years and the ongoing mitigation actions, the company believed animal nutrition's fair value was more likely than not greater than its carrying value as of september 30, 2023, and therefore did not conduct a quantitative evaluation of the reporting unit prior to the annual impairment testing on october 1, 2023. however, as these conditions persisted in the fourth quarter of 2023, the company was no longer able to conclude animal nutrition's fair value more likely than not exceeded carrying value and proceeded to perform the quantitative fair value estimate as described above. following the recording of the impairment charge, the remaining carrying value of goodwill in the animal nutrition reporting unit as of december 31, 2023 was $0.9 billion.
the company performed a sensitivity analysis for the significant assumptions used in the goodwill impairment testing analysis for the animal nutrition reporting unit. the sensitivities were calculated in isolation using the income approach and keeping all other assumptions constant. the sensitivities for revenue growth and ebitda margins do not consider the offsetting impact of a lower discount rate assumption to reflect the reduced risk in estimated future cash flow growth used under the income approach or the related impacts on pricing multiples used under the market approach.
•a hypothetical increase to the discount rate of approximately 25 basis points would result in additional goodwill impairment of approximately $65 million;
•a hypothetical decrease in the expected annual revenue growth rate over the entire forecast period of approximately 100 basis points would result in additional goodwill impairment of approximately $60 million; and
•a hypothetical decrease in the expected ebitda margins in each year over the entire forecast period of approximately 15 basis points would result in additional goodwill impairment of approximately $60 million.
the estimated fair value of the other reporting unit evaluated for impairment using a quantitative assessment during the year ended december 31, 2023 was in excess of 198% of its carrying value, and therefore no impairment was recorded for that reporting unit. there were goodwill impairment charges of $6 million recorded during the year ended december 31, 2021 and none during the year ended december 31, 2022. if management used different estimates and assumptions in its impairment tests, then impairment charges recorded could differ materially.
investments in affiliates description: the company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence, including its 22.5% investment in wilmar. these investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.
judgments and uncertainties: generally, the minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20% ownership of the investee. however, the company considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including but not limited to, ownership percentage, board membership, customer and vendor relationships, and other arrangements. the company also periodically compares the book value of its investment in wilmar against its market value as determined through quoted market prices, and evaluates any potential other than temporary impairment based on the near-term prospects of wilmar in relation to the severity and duration of the decline in fair value and the company's intent and ability to retain its investment in wilmar.
sensitivity of estimate to change: if management used a different accounting method for these investments, then the amount of earnings from affiliates the company recognizes may differ. if management used different assumptions in the evaluation of its wilmar investment, then the amount of any impairment charges could differ materially.

item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data." this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, including but not limited to, those discussed in "item 1a - risk factors." see "cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements" located above in "item 1 - business."
we operate in two reportable segments: merchant solutions and issuer solutions. during the second quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of the consumer portion of our netspend business, which comprised our former consumer solutions segment. our consolidated financial statements include the results of our former consumer solutions segment for periods prior to disposition. see "note 18-segment information" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our segments.
discussions of our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 that have been omitted under this item can be found in "part ii, item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, which was filed with the united states securities and exchange commission on february 17, 2023.
executive overview we are a leading payments technology company delivering innovative software and services to our customers globally. our technologies, services and team member expertise allow us to provide a broad range of solutions that enable our customers to operate their businesses more efficiently across a variety of channels around the world.
we have grown organically, as well as through acquisitions, and we continue to invest in new and innovative technology solutions, infrastructure to support our growing business and the ongoing consolidation and enhancement of our operating platforms. these investments include new product development and innovation to further enhance and differentiate our suite of technology and cloud-based solutions available to customers, along with migration of certain underlying technology platforms to cloud environments to enhance performance, improve speed to market and drive cost efficiencies. we also continue to execute on integration and other activities, such as combining business operations, streamlining technology infrastructure, eliminating duplicative corporate and operational support structures and realizing scale efficiencies.
we have furthered our business strategy through several recent key transactions during 2023 as follows:
•we completed the acquisition of evo payments, inc. ("evo") for total purchase consideration of $4.3 billion. evo is a payment technology and services provider, offering payment solutions to merchants ranging from small and middle market enterprises to multinational companies and organizations across the americas and europe. the cash portion of the purchase consideration was funded through cash on hand and borrowings from our revolving credit facility.
•we completed the sale of the consumer portion of our netspend business for approximately $1 billion. in connection with the sale, we provided $675 million of seller financing and a five-year $50 million secured revolving facility that became available from the date of closing of the sale. we also completed the sale of our gaming business for approximately $400 million.
•our capital structure initiatives during 2023 included the issuance of euro-denominated senior notes and the launch of a commercial paper program:
◦we issued €800 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due march 2031 and received net proceeds of €790.6 million, or $843.6 million based on the exchange rate on the issuance date. the net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes.
◦we established a $2.0 billion commercial paper program under which we may issue senior unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue as a cost effective means of satisfying our short-term liquidity needs.
highlights related to our financial condition at december 31, 2023, and results of operations for the year then ended, include the following:
•consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased to $9,654.4 million, compared to $8,975.5 million for the prior year. the increase in consolidated revenues was primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes, including from the recently acquired evo business, partially offset by the effects on revenue of the divested businesses.
•merchant solutions and issuer solutions segment operating income and operating margin for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable effect of increases in revenues, since certain fixed costs do not vary with revenues, and continued expense management.
•consolidated operating income for the year ended december 31, 2023 included the favorable effects of the increase in revenues as compared to the prior year, partially offset by an increase in expenses primarily related to the acquisition of evo. consolidated operating income for the year ended december 31, 2023 also included the effects of a loss on the sale of our consumer business, which was partially offset by a gain on the sale of our gaming business.
continuing and emerging trends the payments technology industry continues to evolve and grow worldwide and as a result, certain large payment technology companies, including us, have expanded operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures. we expect to continue to expand into new markets and pursue additional acquisitions and joint ventures in existing markets to increase our scale and improve our competitiveness.
the industry continues to grow globally as a result of wider merchant acceptance and increased use of credit and debit cards, advances in payment processing technology and migration to ecommerce, omnichannel and contactless payment solutions. the proliferation of credit and debit cards, as well as other digital payment solutions, has made the acceptance of digital payments a virtual necessity for many businesses, regardless of size, in order to remain competitive. furthermore, the expanding digitization of the economy and availability and access to financial services increases the demand for cards and digital payment solutions, which in turn drives growth in acceptance and transaction volumes.
the use of digital payment solutions, the need for development of technologies and digital-based solutions and expansion of ecommerce, omnichannel and contactless payment solutions has accelerated. we believe that the number of digital payment transactions will continue to grow and that an increasing percentage of these will be facilitated through emerging technologies. as a result, we expect an increasing portion of our future capital investment will be allocated to support the development of new and emerging technologies, including technology modernization, innovation and integration through strategic partnerships.
we also believe new markets will continue to develop and expand in areas that have been previously dominated by paper-based transactions. we expect industries such as education, government and healthcare, as well as recurring payments and b2b payments, to continue to see transactions migrate to digital-based solutions. we anticipate that the continued development of new services and technologies, the emergence of new vertical markets and continued expansion of technology-enabled ecommerce and omnichannel solutions, including expanded scale and market reach through new innovative cloud-based capabilities and strategic partnerships, will be a factor in the growth of our business and our revenues in the future. furthermore, due to its benefits and growth potential, we anticipate the increased exploration of use of artificial intelligence in the payments industry.
for a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our continuing operating results, see the section entitled "risk factors" in item 1a.
macroeconomic effects and other global conditions risks related to macroeconomic conditions we are exposed to general economic conditions, including currency fluctuations, inflation, rising interest rates and other conditions that affect the overall level of consumer, business and government spending, which could negatively affect our financial performance.
certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies. consequently, a portion of our revenues and expenses has been and may continue to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. a strengthening of the u.s. dollar or other significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in an adverse effect on our future financial results; however, we are unable to predict the extent of the potential effect on our financial results.
we have sought to reduce our interest rate risk through issuance of fixed rate debt in place of variable rate debt, including the effect of interest rate swap hedging arrangements to convert a significant portion of the eligible variable rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility to a fixed rate. however, inflationary pressure or interest rate fluctuations have affected and could continue to affect our business and financial performance as a result of higher costs and/or lower consumer spending. in addition, continued inflation or a rise in interest rates could result in an adverse effect on our future financial results and the recoverability of assets. however, as the future magnitude, duration and effects of these conditions are difficult to predict at this time, we are unable to predict the extent of the potential effect on our financial results.
in addition, failures of several financial institutions in the first quarter of 2023, including silicon valley bank and credit suisse, have created some uncertainty in the global financial markets and a greater focus on the potential failure of other banks in the future. although we do not have exposure to and did not experience losses as a result of these failures, we regularly maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limit or the equivalent outside the u.s. a disruption in financial markets could impair our banking partners, which could affect our ability to access our cash or cash equivalents, our ability to provide settlement services or our customers' ability to access their existing cash to fulfill their payment obligations to us. the occurrence of these events could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
when adverse macroeconomic conditions arise, we evaluate where we may be able to implement cost-saving measures, including those related to headcount and discretionary expenses. while economic conditions have shown moderate improvement in recent months, a downturn in macroeconomic conditions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
other global conditions we continue to evaluate the potential effects on our business from health and social events, including pandemics like the covid-19 pandemic. although the covid-19 pandemic has subsided, it caused an economic slowdown and other macroeconomic effects in the u.s. and other markets in which we operate. the global macroeconomic effects of the pandemic may persist for an indefinite period.
we also continue to evaluate the potential effects on our business from heightened geopolitical and economic instability or increased difficulty of conducting business in a country or region due to actual or potential political or military conflict or action, such as those arising from recent global events, which have increased the level of economic and political uncertainty in various regions of the world. although we have not experienced significant exposure or adverse effects on our business and financial results to date, the extent to which these events could affect the global economy and our operations is difficult to predict at this time. however, a significant escalation, expansion of the scope or continuation of the related economic disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
for a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our continuing operating results, see the section entitled "risk factors" in item 1a.
results of operations revenues merchant solutions. the majority of our merchant solutions segment revenues is generated by services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction, depending on card type or industry vertical. we also earn software subscription and licensing fees, as well as other fees for specific value-added services that may be unrelated to the number or value of transactions. these revenues depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry and general economic conditions.
we provide payment technology and software solutions to customers and fund settlement either directly, in markets where we have direct membership with the payment networks, or through our relationship with a member financial institution in markets where we are sponsored. revenues are generally recognized as billed to the customer, net of interchange fees and payment network fees. we market our services through a variety of relationship-led and technology-enabled distribution channels, including a direct sales force, trade associations, agent and enterprise software providers and referral arrangements with value-added resellers ("vars"). we also sell services to isos, payment facilitators and financial institutions. in certain of these arrangements, the iso, financial institution or other external partner receives a share of the customer profitability in the form of a monthly residual payment, which is reflected as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
issuer solutions. issuer solutions segment revenues are primarily derived from long-term processing contracts with financial institutions and other financial services providers. payment processing services revenues are generated primarily from charges based on the number of accounts on file, transactions and authorizations processed, statements generated and/or mailed, managed services, cards embossed and mailed, and other processing services for cardholder accounts on file. most of these customer contracts have prescribed annual minimums, penalties for early termination, and service level agreements that may affect contractual fees if specific service levels are not achieved. issuer solutions revenues also include loyalty redemption services, professional services, and fees from b2b payments services and other financial service solutions marketed to businesses, including software-as-a-service ("saas") offerings that automate key procurement processes, provide invoice capture, coding and approval, and enable virtual cards and integrated payments options across a variety of key vertical markets.
consumer solutions. during the second quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of the consumer portion of our netspend business, which comprised our former consumer solutions segment. for the periods prior to disposition, our consumer solutions arrangements included a stand-ready performance obligation to provide account access and facilitate purchase transactions. revenues principally consisted of fees collected from cardholders and fees generated by cardholder activity in connection with the programs that we managed. customers were typically charged a fee for each purchase transaction made using their cards, unless the customer was on a monthly or annual service plan, in which case the customer was instead charged a monthly or annual subscription fee, as applicable. customers were also charged a monthly maintenance fee after a specified period of inactivity. we also charged fees associated with additional services offered in connection with our accounts, including the use of overdraft features, a variety of bill payment options, card replacement, foreign exchange and card-to-card transfers of funds initiated through our call centers. revenues were recognized net of fees charged by the payment networks for services they provided in processing transactions routed through them.
operating expenses cost of service. cost of service consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to operations and technology-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement functions; the cost of transaction processing systems, including third-party services; the cost of network telecommunications capability; depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities supporting these functions; amortization of intangible assets; costs to fulfill customer contracts; provisions for operating losses; and, when applicable, integration costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, customer support functions other than those supporting revenues, administrative employees and management; share-based compensation; costs to obtain customer contracts; residuals paid to isos; fees paid to vars, independent contractors and other third parties; other selling expenses; occupancy costs of leased space directly related to these functions; advertising costs; and, when applicable, acquisition and integration costs.
operating income and operating margin for the purpose of discussing segment operations, we refer to "operating income," which is calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenues. overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation, are not allocated to segment operations; they are reported in the caption "corporate." impairment of goodwill and gains or losses on business dispositions are also not included in determining segment operating income. in addition, in discussing segment operations we refer to "operating margin," which is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenues.
equity in income of equity method investments we have equity method investments, including a 45% interest in china unionpay data co., ltd., which we account for using the equity method of accounting. equity in income of equity method investments reflects our proportional share of earnings from these investments.

revenues consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by 7.6% to $9,654.4 million, compared to $8,975.5 million for the prior year. the increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes, including from the evo business acquired in 2023.
merchant solutions segment. revenues from our merchant solutions segment for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by 15.3% to $7,151.8 million, compared to $6,204.9 million for the prior year. the increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes, including from the evo business, and growth in subscription and software revenue.
issuer solutions segment. revenues from our issuer solutions segment for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by 6.8% to $2,398.9 million, compared to $2,245.6 million for the prior year. the increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes.
operating expenses cost of service. cost of service for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $3,727.5 million, compared to $3,778.6 million for the prior year. cost of service as a percentage of revenues decreased to 38.6% for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to 42.1% for the prior year. compared to the prior year, cost of service for the year ended december 31, 2023 decreased primarily due to continued prudent expense management and inclusion of costs related to the divested businesses for only a portion of the current year. these favorable effects were partially offset by the inclusion of costs for the evo business, including the related amortization of acquired intangibles. cost of service included amortization of acquired intangibles of $1,318.5 million and $1,263.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by 15.6% to $4,073.8 million, compared to $3,524.6 million for the prior year. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was 42.2% for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to 39.3% for the prior year. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in variable selling and other costs related to the increase in revenues and the inclusion of costs for the evo business. in addition, the increase was driven by the effects of higher acquisition and integration expenses, related primarily to the acquisition of evo, and higher compensation and benefits costs, including an increase in share-based compensation expense for retirement eligible executives and our previous ceo, whose departure was announced on may 1, 2023.
selling, general and administrative expenses included acquisition and integration expenses of $341.4 million and $258.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. share-based compensation expense was $209.0 million and $163.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
corporate. corporate expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023 were $898.0 million, compared to $777.7 million for the prior year. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2023 was primarily due to the increase in acquisition and integration and compensation expenses, partially offset by lower charges related to facilities exit activities in the current year.
operating income and operating margin consolidated operating income for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $1,716.4 million, compared to $640.2 million for the prior year. consolidated operating income and operating margin for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year included the favorable effects of the increase in revenues, since certain fixed costs do not vary with revenues, prudent expense management and lower charges related to facilities exit activities as described above. these effects were partially offset by higher acquisition and integration expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and compensation expenses as described above. consolidated operating income for the year ended december 31, 2023 also included the effects of a $106.9 million gain on the sale of our gaming business and a $243.6 million loss on the sale of our consumer business.
consolidated operating income and operating margin for the year ended december 31, 2022 included the unfavorable effects of an $833.1 million goodwill impairment charge related to our former business and consumer solutions reporting unit and a $127.2 million loss related to the sale of our merchant solutions business in russia. we also recognized charges within loss on business dispositions in our consolidated statement of income of $71.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2022 to reduce the consumer business disposal group to estimated fair value less costs to sell.
segment operating income and operating margin in our merchant solutions segment, operating income and operating margin for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable effect of the increase in revenues, since certain fixed costs do not vary with revenues, and continued expense management. these favorable effects were partially offset by incremental expenses related to continued investment in products, innovation and our technology environments. in addition, the inclusion of evo had an unfavorable effect on the merchant solutions operating margin for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the prior year.
in our issuer solutions segment, operating income and operating margin for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable effect of the increase in revenues, since certain fixed costs do not vary with revenues, and continued expense management.
other income/expense, net interest and other income for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased to $113.7 million, compared to $33.6 million for the prior year, primarily due to interest income associated with the new seller financing notes receivable of $58.3 million recognized during the year ended december 31, 2023. other income for the year ended december 31, 2022 included a gain of $13.2 million recognized in connection with the release and conversion of a portion of our visa convertible preferred shares. see "note 8-other assets" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction.
interest and other expense for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased to $660.2 million, compared to $449.4 million for the prior year, nearly equally affected by an increase in our average outstanding borrowings and higher average interest rates on outstanding borrowings. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2023, we incurred a noncash charge of $15.2 million for the estimated future credit losses on the new seller financing notes receivable. interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2022 included fees and charges incurred in connection with financing activities that occurred during 2022, including $17.3 million related to commitment fees associated with bridge financing for the evo acquisition.
income tax expense our effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 were 17.9% and 74.3%, respectively. the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2023 reflects recognition of a gain on the dispositions of our consumer and gaming businesses for income tax reporting purposes, while an aggregate net loss on the dispositions was recognized for financial reporting purposes. this was partially offset by the favorable effect on the rate of foreign interest income not subject to tax, tax credits, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and the realization of built in losses on corporate restructurings.
the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2022 included the unfavorable effects of the goodwill impairment charge and loss on the sale of our merchant solutions business in russia, for which no tax benefit was recognized, partially offset by the remeasurement of state deferred taxes to reflect enacted tax law changes.
on august 16, 2022, the u.s. government enacted the inflation reduction act into law, which, among other things, implemented a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax based on global adjusted financial statement income and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases effective beginning january 1, 2023. we do not expect the corporate alternative minimum tax will have a material effect on our reported results, cash flows or financial position. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we reflected excise tax of $3.9 million within equity as part of the cost of common stock repurchased, net of share issuances, during the period.
in december 2022, the eu member states formally adopted the pillar two directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the organization for economic co-operation and development pillar two framework. the eu effective dates are january 1, 2024, and january 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. a significant number of other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation with varying effective dates in the future. we are continuing to evaluate the potential effect on future periods of the pillar two framework, pending legislative adoption by additional individual countries.
equity in income of equity method investments equity in income of equity method investments decreased to $67.9 million compared to $85.7 million for the prior year. equity in income of equity method investments for the year ended december 31, 2022 included $18.8 million in gains on the sale of certain equity method investments that did not recur in the current year.
net income attributable to global payments net income attributable to global payments was $986.2 million compared to $111.5 million for the prior year, reflecting the changes noted above.
diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share was $3.77 compared to $0.40 for the prior year. diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2023 reflects the changes in net income and a decrease in the weighted-average number of shares outstanding.
liquidity and capital resources we have numerous sources of capital, including cash on hand and cash flows generated from operations as well as various sources of financing. in the ordinary course of our business, a significant portion of our liquidity comes from operating cash flows and borrowings, including the capacity under our revolving credit facility.
our capital allocation priorities are to make planned capital investments in our business, to pursue acquisitions that meet our corporate objectives, to pay dividends, to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt and to repurchase shares of our common stock. our significant contractual cash requirements also include ongoing payments for lease liabilities and contractual obligations related to service arrangements with suppliers for fixed or minimum amounts, which primarily relate to software, technology infrastructure and related services. commitments under our borrowing arrangements are further described in "note 9-long-term debt and lines of credit" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and below under "long-term debt and lines of credit." for additional information regarding our other cash commitments and contractual obligations, see "note 7-leases" and "note 19-commitments and contingencies" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
our capital plan objectives are to support our operational needs and strategic plan for long-term growth while optimizing our cost of capital and financial position. to supplement cash from operating activities, we use a combination of bank financing, such as borrowings under our credit facilities, commercial paper program and senior note issuances, for general corporate purposes and to fund acquisitions. our commercial paper program, established during the first quarter of 2023, provides a cost effective means of addressing our short-term liquidity needs and is backstopped by our revolving credit agreement, in that the amount of commercial paper notes outstanding cannot exceed the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility. finally, specialized lines of credit are also used in certain of our markets to fund merchant settlement prior to receipt of funds from the card networks.
we regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital position relative to cash requirements, and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future through the issuance of debt or equity or by other means. accumulated cash balances are invested in high-quality, marketable short-term instruments. we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the near and long term.
at december 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $2,088.9 million. of this amount, we considered $703.3 million to be available for general purposes, of which $64.3 million is undistributed foreign earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states. the available cash of $703.3 million does not include the following: (i) settlement-related cash balances, (ii) funds held as collateral for merchant losses ("merchant reserves") and (iii) funds held for customers. settlement-related cash balances represent funds that we hold when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the funding obligation to the merchant. settlement-related cash balances are not restricted in their use; however, these funds are generally paid out in satisfaction of settlement processing obligations the following day. merchant reserves serve as collateral to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant's agreement. while this cash is not restricted in its use, we believe that designating this cash as a merchant reserve strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors. funds held for customers, which are not restricted in their use, include amounts collected before the corresponding obligation is due to be settled to or at the direction of our customers.
we also had restricted cash of $167.2 million as of december 31, 2023, representing amounts deposited by customers for prepaid card transactions and funds held as a liquidity reserve. these balances are subject to local regulatory restrictions requiring appropriate segregation and restriction in their use.
operating activities provided net cash of $2,248.7 million and $2,244.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which reflect net income adjusted for noncash items, including depreciation, amortization and the provision for credit losses, charges associated with the net loss on business dispositions and facility exit charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities. the increase in cash flows from operating activities from the prior year was due to fluctuations in operating results and related assets and liabilities that are affected primarily by timing of month-end and transaction volume, including changes in settlement processing assets and obligations and accounts payable and other liability balances.
we used net cash in investing activities of $4,361.1 million and $675.5 million during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. cash used for investing activities primarily represents cash used to fund acquisitions, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, and capital expenditures. during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we used cash of $4,225.6 million and $68.8 million, respectively, for acquisitions. we made capital expenditures of $658.1 million and $615.7 million during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. these investments include software and hardware to support the development of new technologies, infrastructure to support our growing business and the consolidation and enhancement of our operating platforms. these investments also include new product development and innovation to further enhance and differentiate our suite of technology and cloud-based solutions available to customers. we expect to continue to make significant capital investments in the business, and we anticipate capital expenditures to grow at a similar rate as our revenue growth during the year ending december 31, 2024. additionally, investing cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2023 includes the net effect on cash from the sale of our consumer and gaming businesses, cash received from the sale of investments in visa common shares of $42.1 million and the issuance and subsequent repayment of a $50.0 million secured revolving credit facility available from the date of the sale to the purchasers of the consumer business. investing cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2022 includes the net effect on cash from the sale of our merchant solutions business in russia and cash received from the sale of investments in visa common shares of $13.2 million and equity method investments of $19.9 million.
financing activities include borrowings and repayments made under our various debt arrangements, as well as borrowings and repayments made under specialized lines of credit to fund daily settlement activities. our borrowing arrangements are further described in "note 9-long-term debt and lines of credit" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and below under "long-term debt and lines of credit." financing activities also include cash flows associated with common stock repurchase programs and share-based compensation programs, cash distributions made to our shareholders and cash contributions from and distributions to noncontrolling interests. financing activities provided net cash of $2,141.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2023, and we used net cash in financing activities of $1,376.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2022.
proceeds from long-term debt were $10,336.9 million and $9,812.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. repayments of long-term debt were $9,099.9 million and $7,895.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. proceeds from and repayments of long-term debt consist of borrowings and repayments that we make with available cash, from time-to-time, under our revolving credit facility, as well as scheduled principal repayments we make on our term loans, finance leases and other vendor financing arrangements. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we also had net borrowings of $1,371.6 million under our commercial paper program. see section "long-term debt and lines of credit" below for further discussion of our recent debt transactions.
activity under our settlement lines of credit is affected primarily by timing of month-end and transaction volume. during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had net borrowings of settlement lines of credit of $220.7 million and $285.6 million, respectively.
we repurchase our common stock mainly through open market repurchase plans and, at times, through accelerated share repurchase ("asr") programs. during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we used $418.3 million and $2,921.3 million, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. as of december 31, 2023, the remaining amount available under our share repurchase program was $1,090.2 million.
we paid dividends to our common shareholders in the amounts of $260.4 million and $274.0 million during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we made distributions to noncontrolling interests in the amount of $33.0 million and $23.0 million during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

("tsys") in september 2019 (the "tsys merger"), we assumed $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes of tsys, consisting of the following: (i) $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.800% senior notes due 2021, which were redeemed in february 2021; (ii) $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% senior notes due 2023, which were redeemed in june 2023; (iii) $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.000% senior notes due 2023, which were redeemed in june 2023; (iv) $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.800% senior notes due 2026; and (v) $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.450% senior notes due 2028. for the 4.800% senior notes due 2026, interest is payable semi-annually each april 1 and october 1. for the 4.450% senior notes due 2028, interest is payable semi-annually each june 1 and december 1. the difference between the acquisition-date fair value and face value of senior notes assumed in the tsys merger is recognized over the terms of the respective notes as a reduction of interest expense. the amortization of this fair value adjustment was $15.7 million and $27.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
convertible notes we have $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.000% convertible notes due 2029, which were issued on august 8, 2022 in a private placement pursuant to an investment agreement with silver lake partners. the net proceeds from this offering were approximately $1.44 billion, reflecting an issuance discount of $37.5 million and $20.4 million of debt issuance costs, which were capitalized and reflected as a reduction of the related carrying amount of the convertible notes in our consolidated balance sheet.
interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on february 15 and august 15 of each year, beginning on february 15, 2023, to the holders of record on the preceding february 1 and august 1, respectively.
the notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time after the date that is 18 months after issuance (or earlier, upon the occurrence of certain corporate events) until the scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date. the notes are convertible into cash and shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate of 7.1421 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes (which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $140.01 per share), subject to customary anti-dilution and other adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. upon conversion, the principal amount of, and interest due on, the convertible notes are required to be settled in cash and any other amounts may be settled in shares, cash or a combination of shares and cash at our election.
the notes are not redeemable by us. if certain corporate events that constitute a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) occur, any holder of the notes may require that we repurchase all or any portion of their notes for cash at a purchase price of par plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. in addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) occur, then the conversion rate will in certain circumstances be increased for a specified period of time. the notes include customary covenants for notes of this type, as well as customary events of default, which may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the convertible notes.
on august 8, 2022, in connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions to cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock initially underlying the notes. the economic effect of the capped call transactions is to hedge the potential dilutive effect upon conversion of the notes, or offset our cash obligation if the cash settlement option is elected, up to a cap price determined based on a hedging period that commenced on august 9, 2022 and concluded on august 25, 2022. the capped call had an initial strike price of $140.67 per share and a cap price of $229.26 per share. the capped call transactions meet the accounting criteria to be reflected in stockholders' equity and not accounted for as derivatives. the cost of $302.4 million incurred in connection with the capped call transactions was reflected as a reduction to paid-in-capital in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2022, net of applicable income taxes.
revolving credit facility on august 19, 2022, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with bank of america, n.a., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of financial institutions, as lenders and other agents. the revolving credit agreement provides for an unsubordinated unsecured $5.75 billion revolving credit facility. we capitalized debt issuance costs of $12.3 million in connection with the issuance under the revolving credit facility. the revolving credit facility matures in august 2027. borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid prior to maturity without premium or penalty, subject to payment of certain customary expenses of lenders and customary notice provisions.
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are available to be made in us dollars, euros, sterling, canadian dollars and, subject to certain conditions, certain other currencies at our option. borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to (i) for secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") based currencies or certain alternative currencies, a secured overnight financing rate (subject to a 0.00% floor) plus a 0.10% credit spread adjustment or an alternative currency term rate (subject to a 0.00% floor), as applicable, (ii) for us dollar borrowings, a base rate, (iii) for us dollar borrowings, a daily floating secured overnight financing rate (subject to a 0.00% floor on or after january 1, 2023) plus a 0.10% credit spread adjustment or (iv) for certain alternative currencies, a daily alternative currency rate (subject to a 0.00% floor), in each case, plus an applicable margin. the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility will range from 1.125% to 1.875% depending on our credit rating. in addition, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee with respect to the unused portion of the revolving credit facility at an applicable rate per annum ranging from 0.125% to 0.300% depending on our credit rating.
we may issue standby letters of credit of up to $250.0 million in the aggregate under the revolving credit facility. outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility reduce the amount of borrowings available to us. the amounts available to borrow under the revolving credit facility are also determined by a financial leverage covenant. as of december 31, 2023, there were borrowings of $1,570.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an interest rate of 6.84%, and the total available commitments under the revolving credit facility were $2.8 billion.
commercial paper in january 2023, we established a $2.0 billion commercial paper program under which we may issue senior unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. the program is backstopped by our revolving credit agreement, in that the amount of commercial paper notes outstanding cannot exceed the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility. as such, we could draw on the revolving credit facility to repay commercial paper notes that cannot be rolled over or refinanced with similar debt.
commercial paper notes are expected to be issued at a discount from par, or they may bear interest, each at commercial paper market rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance. the proceeds from issuances of commercial paper notes will be used primarily for general corporate purposes but may also be used for acquisitions, to pay dividends, for debt refinancing or for other purposes.
as of december 31, 2023, we had net borrowings under our commercial paper program of $1,371.6 million outstanding with a weighted average annual interest rate of 6.06%.
prior credit facility prior to the revolving credit facility, we were party to a prior credit facility agreement with bank of america, n.a., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of financial institutions, as lenders and other agents (as amended from time-to-time). the prior credit facility provided for a senior unsecured $2.0 billion term loan facility and a senior unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. in august 2022, all borrowings outstanding and other amounts due under the prior credit facility were repaid and the prior credit facility was terminated.
bridge facility on august 1, 2022, in connection with our entry into the evo merger agreement, we obtained commitments for a $4.3 billion, 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility. upon the execution of permanent financing, including the issuance of our senior unsecured notes and entry into the revolving credit facility described above, the aggregate commitments under the bridge facility were reduced to zero and terminated.
compliance with covenants the convertible notes include customary covenants and events of default for convertible notes of this type. the revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and restrictive covenants, including, among others, financial covenants based on net leverage and interest coverage ratios, and customary events of default. the required leverage ratio was increased to 4.50 to 1.00 as a result of the acquisition of evo, and will gradually step-down over eight quarters to the original required ratio of 3.75 to 1.00. as of december 31, 2023, the required leverage ratio is 4.50 to 1.00, and the required interest coverage ratio is 3.00 to 1.00. we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december 31, 2023.
settlement lines of credit in various markets where we do business, we have specialized lines of credit, that are restricted for use in funding settlement. the settlement lines of credit generally have variable interest rates, are subject to annual review and are denominated in local currency but may, in some cases, facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies. for certain of our lines of credit, the available credit is increased by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender. accordingly, the amount of the outstanding lines of credit may exceed the stated credit limit. as of december 31, 2023, a total of $88.5 million of cash on deposit was used to determine the available credit.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $981.2 million outstanding under these lines of credit with additional capacity to fund settlement of $1,852.5 million. during the year ended december 31, 2023, the maximum and average outstanding balances under these lines of credit were $1,506.5 million and $515.7 million, respectively. the weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings was 5.95% at december 31, 2023.
see "note 9-long-term debt and lines of credit" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our borrowing agreements.
bin/ica agreements in certain markets, we enter into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with banks. these agreements allow us to use the banks' identification numbers, referred to as bank identification number ("bin") for visa transactions and interbank card association ("ica") number for mastercard transactions, to clear credit card transactions through visa and mastercard. certain of such agreements contain financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31, 2023.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, which often require the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. we consider the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements because the application of these policies requires significant judgment on the part of management, and as a result, actual future developments may be different from those expected at the time that we make these important judgments. we have discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions. therefore, the following descriptions of our critical accounting estimates are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements. you should read the following in conjunction with "note 1-basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in "item 1a - risk factors" in this annual report.
business combinations from time-to-time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. the measurement principle for the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in a business combination is at estimated fair value as of the acquisition date, with certain exceptions. the excess of the total consideration transferred over the amount of the net identifiable assets acquired determined in accordance with the measurement guidance for such items is recognized as goodwill.
the estimates we use to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. we use information available to us to make fair value determinations, and we engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. the estimated fair values of customer-related and contract-based intangible assets are generally determined using the income approach, which is based on projected cash flows discounted to their present value using discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the forecasted cash flows. the discount rates used represent a risk adjusted market participant weighted-average cost of capital, derived using customary market metrics. these measures of fair value also require considerable judgments about future events, including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted customer attrition rates, contract renewal estimates and technology changes. acquired technologies are generally valued using the replacement cost method, which requires us to estimate the costs to construct an asset of equivalent utility at prices available at the time of the valuation analysis, with adjustments in value for physical deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence. trademarks and trade names are generally valued using the "relief-from-royalty" approach. this method assumes that trademarks and trade names have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. this method requires us to estimate the future revenues for the related asset, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted-average cost of capital. this measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value a market participant would be willing to pay in order to achieve the benefits associated with the trademark or trade name.
while we use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we make adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of income. we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the period over which to recognize the amount of acquisition-related intangible assets as an expense. we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate.
goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets are also regularly evaluated for impairment, which requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions as further described below. a change in estimated fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually (in the fourth quarter) and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative assessment for impairment is necessary. the election of whether or not to perform a qualitative assessment is made annually and may vary by reporting unit. factors we consider in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance of our reporting units, events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units, our share price, and other relevant entity-specific events. if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test would be required.
when applying the quantitative assessment, we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques, principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach. the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows, while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies. determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions.
during the second quarter of 2022, the sustained decline in our share price and increases in discount rates, primarily resulting from increased economic uncertainty, indicated a potential decline in fair value and triggered a requirement to evaluate our issuer solutions and former business and consumer solutions reporting units for potential impairment as of june 30, 2022. furthermore, the estimated sales price for the consumer business portion of our former business and consumer solutions reporting unit also indicated a potential decline in fair value as of june 30, 2022. we determined on the basis of the quantitative assessment that the fair value of our issuer solutions reporting unit was still greater than its carrying amount, indicating no impairment. based on the quantitative assessment of our former business and consumer solutions reporting unit, including consideration of the consumer business disposal group and the remaining assets of the reporting unit, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $833.1 million in our consolidated statement of income during the three months ended june 30, 2022.
we regularly monitor any changes in the business and evaluate whether such changes affect the determination of our reporting units. during the third quarter of 2022, as a result of the pending divestiture of our consumer business and changes in how our business is managed, we realigned the businesses previously comprising our former business and consumer solutions segment to include the b2b portion within our issuer solutions segment and the consumer portion forming our consumer solutions segment. in connection with the change in presentation of segment information, the b2b portion of our former business and consumer solutions reporting unit was realigned into the issuer solutions reporting unit, including a reallocation of goodwill. during the second quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of our consumer business. in addition, during 2023, we realigned our reporting units based on organizational changes and the acquired operations of evo. there were no significant changes in the methodology used to assess goodwill for potential impairment during the year ended december 31, 2023.
as of october 1, 2023, our reporting units consisted of the following: north america payments solutions, vertical market software solutions, europe merchant solutions, spain merchant solutions, asia-pacific merchant solutions, latin america merchant solutions and issuer solutions. as of october 1, 2023, we performed a quantitative assessment of impairment for our issuer solutions, asia-pacific merchant solutions and latin america merchant solutions reporting units and a qualitative assessment for all other reporting units. we determined on the basis of the quantitative assessments of our issuer solutions, asia-pacific merchant solutions and latin america merchant solutions reporting units that the fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its respective carrying amount, indicating no impairment. additionally, we determined on the basis of the qualitative factors that the fair value of other reporting units was not more likely than not less than the respective carrying amounts. we believe that the fair value of each of our reporting units is substantially in excess of its carrying amount, except for our latin america merchant solutions reporting unit, which has smaller excess compared to the other reporting units since it was recently acquired in connection with the evo acquisition, and our issuer solutions reporting unit, whose fair value exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 4% as of october 1, 2023.
we continue to closely monitor developments related to global events and macroeconomic conditions. the future magnitude, duration and effects of these events and conditions are difficult to predict at this time, and it is reasonably possible that future developments could have a negative effect on the estimates and assumptions utilized in our goodwill impairment assessments and could result in material impairment charges in future periods.
intangible and long-lived assets we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment, lease right-of-use assets and finite-life intangible assets may not be recoverable. when factors indicate that these long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying amount of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. the evaluation is performed at the asset group level, which is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. if the carrying amount of the asset group is determined to be not recoverable and exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, measured as the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable.
as a result of actions taken during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 to reduce our facility footprint in certain markets around the world, we recognized charges of $6.0 million and $30.4 million, respectively, primarily related to certain lease right-of-use assets, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and equipment to reduce the carrying amount of each asset group to estimated fair value.
we classify an asset or business as a held for sale disposal group if we have committed to a plan to sell the asset or business within one year and are actively marketing the asset or business in its current condition for a price that is reasonable in comparison to its estimated fair value. disposal groups held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. subsequent changes to the estimated selling price of an asset or disposal group held for sale are recognized as gains or losses in our consolidated statement of income and any subsequent gains are limited to the cumulative losses previously recognized. during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized net losses of $243.6 million and $71.9 million, respectively, on the consumer business disposition to reduce the carrying amount of the consumer disposal group to estimated fair value less costs to sell, including the effects of incremental negotiated closing adjustments, changes in the estimated fair value of the seller financing and the effects of the final tax structure of the transaction. in addition, we recognized a $106.9 million gain on the sale of the gaming business in our consolidated statement of income during the year ended december 31, 2023.
capitalization of internal-use software costs we develop software that is used in providing services to customers. capitalization of internal-use software costs, primarily associated with operating platforms, occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. the preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives, the evaluation of alternatives, the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives. costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are recognized as expense as incurred. currently unforeseen circumstances in software development, such as a significant change in the manner in which the software is intended to be used, obsolescence or a significant reduction in revenues due to customer attrition, could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort, which could result, and from time-to-time has resulted, in an impairment charge related to previously capitalized software development costs. the carrying amount of internal-use software, including work-in-progress, at december 31, 2023 was $1,080.7 million. costs capitalized during the year ended december 31, 2023 totaled $337.8 million.
in addition, we capitalize implementation costs associated with cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts following the same internal-use software capitalization criteria. our cloud computing arrangements involve services we use to support certain internal corporate functions as well as technology associated with revenue-generating activities. we regularly evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of the capitalized implementation costs may not be recoverable. as of december 31, 2023, capitalized implementation costs, net of accumulated amortization, were $206.5 million and are presented within other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. costs capitalized during the year ended december 31, 2023 totaled $66.2 million.
there were no significant changes in the accounting methodology used for capitalization of internal-use software during the year ended december 31, 2023.
revenue recognition in accordance with accounting standards codification topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers ("asc 606"), we apply judgment in the determination of performance obligations, in particular related to large customer contracts within the issuer solutions segment. performance obligations in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. to the extent a contract includes multiple promised services, we must apply judgment to determine whether promised services are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. if these criteria are not met, the promised services are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation. in addition, a single performance obligation may comprise a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.
income taxes we determine our provision for income taxes using management's judgments, estimates and interpretation and application of complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. such differences in timing result in deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
we believe our tax return positions are fully supportable; however, we recognize the benefit for tax positions only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits. issues raised by a tax authority may be resolved at an amount different than the related benefit recognized. when facts and circumstances change (including an effective settlement of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), the effect is recognized in the period of change. the unrecognized tax benefits that exist at december 31, 2023 would affect our provision for income taxes in the future, if recognized.
judgment is required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. to the extent that we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets, these deferred tax assets are adjusted via a valuation allowance through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made.
see "note 12-income tax" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and deferred tax valuation allowances during the year ended december 31, 2023.
redeemable noncontrolling interests redeemable noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries in poland, greece, and chile relate to the portion of equity in each of those subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to us, which is redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. the redeemable noncontrolling interest for each subsidiary is reflected at the higher of: (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interest's share of comprehensive income (loss), capital contributions and distributions or (ii) the redemption price. estimates of redemption price are based on projected operating performance of each subsidiary, including key assumptions - revenue growth rates, current and expected market conditions and weighted-average cost of capital. refer to "note 16-noncontrolling interests" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
effect of new accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted from time-to-time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standards setting bodies that may affect our current and/or future financial statements. see "note 1-basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.

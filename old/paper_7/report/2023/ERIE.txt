recent accounting standards see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 2, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and the impact on our financial statements if known.
operating overview overview we are a pennsylvania business corporation that since 1925 has been the managing attorney-in-fact for the subscribers (policyholders) at the exchange, a reciprocal insurer that writes property and casualty insurance. our primary function as attorney-in-fact is to perform policy issuance and renewal services on behalf of the subscribers at the exchange. we also act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the exchange, as well as the service provider for the exchange's insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services.
the exchange is a reciprocal insurance exchange, which is an unincorporated association of individuals, partnerships and corporations that agree to insure one another. each applicant for insurance (a subscriber) to the exchange signs a subscriber's agreement, which contains an appointment of indemnity as their attorney-in-fact to transact the business of the exchange on their behalf.
in accordance with the subscriber's agreement for acting as attorney-in-fact in these two capacities, we retain a management fee. management fee revenue is based upon all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange and the management fee rate, which is not to exceed 25%. our board of directors establishes the management fee rate at least annually, generally in december for the following year.  the process of setting the management fee rate includes, but is not limited to, the evaluation of current year operating results compared to both prior year and industry estimated results for both indemnity and the exchange, and consideration of several factors for both entities including, but not limited to: their relative financial strength and capital position; projected revenue, expense and earnings for the subsequent year; future capital needs; as well as competitive position. the management fee rate was set at 25% for 2023, 2022 and 2021.  based on analysis of the foregoing factors, our board of directors set the 2024 management fee rate again at 25%.
our earnings are primarily driven by the management fee revenue generated for the services we provide on behalf of the subscribers at the exchange.  the policy issuance and renewal services we provide are related to the sales, underwriting and issuance of policies. the sales related services we provide include agent compensation and certain sales and advertising support services. agent compensation includes scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as incentive compensation, which is earned by achieving targeted measures. agent compensation comprised approximately 67% of our 2023 policy issuance and renewal expenses. the underwriting services we provide include underwriting and policy processing and comprised approximately 9% of our 2023 policy issuance and renewal expenses. the remaining services we provide include customer service and administrative support. we also provide information technology services that support all the functions listed above that comprised approximately 11% of our 2023 policy issuance and renewal expenses. included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these policy issuance and renewal functions.
consistent with its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the exchange does not have any employees or officers. therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the subscribers' attorney-in-fact. indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the exchange with respect to its administrative services as enumerated in the subscriber's agreement. the exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and indemnity. claims handling services include costs incurred in the claims process, including the adjustment, investigation, defense, recording and payment functions. life insurance management services include costs incurred in the management and processing of life insurance business. investment management services are related to investment trading activity, accounting and all other functions attributable to the investment of funds. in 2023, approximately 71% of the administrative services expenses were entirely attributable to the respective administrative functions (claims handling, life insurance management and investment management), while the remaining 29% of these expenses were allocations of costs for departments that support these administrative functions. the expenses we incur and related reimbursements we receive for administrative services are presented gross in our statements of operations. the subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to indemnity. reimbursements are settled at cost on a monthly basis. state insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.
our results of operations are tied to the growth and financial condition of the exchange as the exchange is our sole customer, and our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange. the exchange generates revenue by insuring preferred and standard risks, with personal lines comprising 70% of the 2023 direct and affiliated assumed written premiums and commercial lines comprising the remaining 30%.  the principal personal lines products are private passenger automobile and homeowners.  the principal commercial lines products are commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and workers compensation.
we generate investment income from our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios. our portfolio is managed with the objective of maximizing after-tax returns on a risk-adjusted basis. we actively evaluate the fixed maturity portfolios for securities in an unrealized loss position and record impairment write-downs on investments in instances where we have the intent to sell or it's more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security. impairments resulting from a credit loss are recognized in earnings with a corresponding allowance on the statement of financial position.

nm = not meaningful operating income increased in 2023 compared to 2022 as growth in operating revenue outpaced the growth in operating expenses. management fee revenue is based upon the management fee rate we charge and the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange.  the management fee rate was 25% for 2023, 2022, and 2021.  the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange increased 17.0% to $10.1 billion in 2023 and 9.2% to $8.6 billion in 2022.
cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 12.0% to $2.0 billion in 2023 primarily due to higher scheduled commissions driven by direct and affiliated assumed written premium growth, as well as increased employee compensation and technology costs. cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 7.0% to $1.8 billion in 2022 primarily due to higher scheduled commissions driven by direct and affiliated assumed written premium growth, as well as increased professional fees and technology costs. increases in the cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services in both periods were partially offset by decreased agent incentive compensation driven by higher claims severity and related loss costs experienced by the exchange.
management fee revenue for administrative services increased 9.2% to $63.7 million in 2023 compared to an increase of 0.1% in 2022. the administrative services reimbursement revenue and corresponding cost of operations increased both total operating revenue and total operating expenses by $737.1 million in 2023 and $668.3 million in 2022, but had no net impact on operating income.
total investment income increased $28.3 million in 2023 primarily due to lower net realized and unrealized investment losses and an increase in net investment income compared to 2022. total investment income decreased $66.7 million in 2022
primarily due to a decrease in net investment income as well as net realized and unrealized investment losses in 2022 compared to net gains in 2021.
general conditions and trends affecting our business economic conditions unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment, and the threat of recession, among others, may lead the exchange's customers to modify coverage, not renew policies, or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the exchange, and consequently our management fee revenue.  inflation remained elevated from historical levels during 2023. continued elevated inflation or supply chain disruptions could impact the exchange's operations and our management fees. in particular, unanticipated increased inflation costs including medical cost inflation, building material cost inflation, auto repair and replacement cost inflation, and social inflation may impact adequacy of estimated loss reserves and future premium rates of the exchange. the extent and duration of the impacts to economic conditions remain uncertain. if any of these items impacted the financial condition or operations of the exchange, it could have an impact on our financial results. see financial condition, liquidity and capital resources, and part i, item 1a. "risk factors" contained within this report for a discussion of potential impacts to our operations or those of the exchange.
financial market volatility our portfolio of fixed maturity and equity security investments is subject to market volatility especially in periods of instability in the worldwide financial markets. over time, net investment income could also be impacted by volatility and by the general level of interest rates, which impact reinvested cash flow from the portfolio and business operations. depending upon market conditions, considerable fluctuation could occur in the fair value of our investment portfolio and reported total investment income, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. various ongoing geopolitical events, the uncertain inflationary and interest rate environments, and a potential economic slowdown could have a significant impact on the global financial markets with the potential for future losses and/or impairments on our investment portfolio.
critical accounting estimates the financial statements include amounts based upon estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures. we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and 2) different estimates that could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are likely to occur from period-to-period, could have a material impact on our statements of operations or financial position.
the following presents a discussion of those accounting policies surrounding estimates that we believe are the most critical to our reported amounts and require the most subjective and complex judgment. if actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions, there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. the estimates and the estimating methods used are reviewed continually, and any adjustments considered necessary are reflected in current earnings.
investment valuation fair value measurements we make estimates concerning the fair value of our investments using valuation techniques to derive the fair value of the fixed maturity and equity investments we hold. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date.
fair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information. we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. our investments are categorized into a three-level fair value hierarchy which assigns a level 1 for highly observable inputs and a level 3 to unobservable inputs. we continually assess whether or not an active market exists for all of our investments and as of each reporting date we re-evaluate their classification in the fair value hierarchy.
as of each reporting period, financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. the presence of at least one unobservable input that has significant impact to the fair value measurement would result in classification as a level 3 instrument. our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset, such as the relative impact on the fair value as a result of including a particular input and market conditions. while estimates of the fair values of our investment portfolio are obtained from outside pricing services, we ultimately determine whether the inputs used are observable or unobservable.
as of december 31, 2023, substantially all of the securities measured at fair value in our investment portfolio are classified as level 2. level 2 securities are valued using industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as the interest rate and credit spread for the underlying financial instruments. all significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable information in the marketplace, or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. at december 31, 2023, our investments classified as level 3 were not significant.
see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 5, fair value, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on the fair value measurement of our investments.
impairments our fixed maturity portfolio experienced unrealized losses in 2023 and 2022 as a result of the higher interest rate environment compared to prior years. we regularly monitor our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios for price changes and perform detailed reviews of securities in an unrealized loss position that may indicate that credit-related or other impairments exist. as of december 31, 2023, our intent to sell and credit-related impairments were not material to our financial condition or results of operations.
see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 2, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on impairments.
retirement benefit plans for employees our pension plans consist of a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and an unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan ("serp") for certain members of executive and senior management. although we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, there are reimbursements between us and the exchange and its subsidiaries for their allocated share of pension income or cost. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 9, postretirement benefits, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on these reimbursements.
our pension obligation is developed from actuarial estimates.  several statistical and other factors, which attempt to anticipate future events, are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans.  key factors include assumptions about the discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets.  we review these assumptions annually and modify them considering historical experience, current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, and expected future trends.
accumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments.  we discount those cash payments based upon a yield curve developed from corporate bond yield information with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits.  lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense, while higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense.  the construction of the yield curve is based upon yields of corporate bonds rated aa or equivalent quality.  target yields are developed from bonds at various maturity points and a curve is fitted to those targets.  spot rates (zero coupon bond yields) are developed from the yield curve and used to discount benefit payment amounts associated with each future year.  the present value of plan benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.  a single discount rate is then developed to produce the same present value. the cash flows from the yield curve were matched against our projected benefit payments in the pension plan, which have a duration of about 15 years.  this yield curve supported the selection of a 5.34% discount rate for the projected benefit obligation at december 31, 2023 and for the 2024 pension income.  the same methodology was used to develop the 5.67% and 3.16% discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation for 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the pension income for 2023 and expense for 2022, respectively. a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would increase pension cost in the following year by $4.1 million, of which our share would be approximately $1.6 million, and would increase the pension benefit obligation by $37.2 million.
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors, including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets.  these unrecognized gains and losses are recorded in the pension plan obligation and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). these amounts are systematically recognized to net periodic pension expense in future periods, with gains decreasing and losses increasing future pension expense. if actuarial net gains or losses exceed 5% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-
related value of plan assets, the excess is recognized through the net periodic pension expense equally over the estimated service period of the employee group, which is currently 14 years.
the expected long-term rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid.  to determine the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we utilized models based upon rigorous historical analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets based upon key factors such as historical returns for the asset class' applicable indices, the correlations of the asset classes under various market conditions and consensus views on future real economic growth and inflation.  the expected future return for each asset class is then combined by considering correlations between asset classes and the volatilities of each asset class to produce a reasonable range of asset return results within which our expected long-term rate of return assumption falls. while the expected long-term rate of return is generally less susceptible to annual revisions as there are typically no significant changes in the asset mix, we increased the expected return on asset assumption from 6.50% to 7.00% in 2024 based on the current asset allocation and considering a review of the key factors and expectations of future performance as well as the current market environment. a change of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $2.9 million impact on net pension benefit cost in the following year, of which our share would be approximately $1.2 million.
we use a four-year averaging method to determine the market-related value of plan assets, which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense.  under this methodology, asset gains or losses that result from returns that differ from our long-term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market-related value of assets on a level basis over a four-year period.  the market-related asset experience during 2023 that related to the actual investment return being different from that assumed during the prior year was a gain of $36.8 million. recognition of this gain will be deferred and recognized over a four-year period, consistent with the market-related asset value methodology. once factored into the market-related asset value, these experience gains and losses will be amortized over a period of 14 years, which is the remaining service period of the employee group.
in 2023, we recognized net pension benefit income of $3.8 million primarily driven by higher discount rates and expected return on assets, partially offset by lower than expected returns during 2022. we continue to project net pension benefit income in 2024 as opposed to expense. while our discount rate assumptions decreased for 2024, the estimated increase in net pension benefit income to $4.3 million in 2024 is primarily due to an anticipated one-time serp settlement credit of $1.0 million. our share of the net pension benefit income after reimbursements was $0.9 million in 2023. we expect our share of the net pension benefit income to be approximately $1.4 million in 2024, of which expense of $13.0 million will be recorded in operating expense and income of $14.4 million will be recorded in other income.
the actuarial assumptions we used in determining our pension obligation may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants.  while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 9, postretirement benefits, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on the pension plans.
results of operations management fee revenue we have two performance obligations in the subscriber's agreement, providing policy issuance and renewal services and acting as attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange, as well as the service provider for the exchange's insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services. we retain management fees for acting as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange in these two capacities and allocate our revenues between our performance obligations.
the management fee is calculated by multiplying all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange by the management fee rate, which is determined by our board of directors at least annually.  the management fee rate was set at 25% for 2023, 2022 and 2021.  changes in the management fee rate can affect our revenue and net income significantly. the transaction price, including management fee revenue and administrative services reimbursement revenue, includes variable consideration and is allocated based on the estimated standalone selling prices developed using industry information and other available information for similar services. we update the transaction price and the related allocation at least annually based upon the most recent information available or more frequently if there have been significant changes in any components considered in the transaction price.

(1)    a constraining estimate of variable consideration exists related to the potential for management fees to be returned if a policy were to be cancelled mid-term. management fees are returned to the exchange when policies are cancelled mid-term and unearned premiums are refunded.
(2)    management fee revenue - administrative services is recognized over time as the services are provided. see item 8. "financial statements - note 3, revenue, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report.
direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange direct and affiliated assumed premiums include premiums written directly by the exchange and premiums assumed from its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries. direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange increased 17.0% to $10.1 billion in 2023, from $8.6 billion in 2022, primarily driven by increased personal lines and commercial multi-peril premiums written.  year-over-year policies in force for all lines of business increased 6.9% in 2023 as the result of continuing strong policyholder retention and an increase in new policies written, compared to 3.6% in 2022.  the year-over-year average premium per policy for all lines of business increased 9.4% at december 31, 2023, compared to 5.4% at december 31, 2022.
premiums generated from new business increased 37.9% to $1.5 billion in 2023. contributing to this change was a 23.7% increase in new business policies written and a 11.5% increase in year-over-year average premium per policy on new business at december 31, 2023. premiums generated from new business increased 14.5% to $1.1 billion in 2022. year-over-year average premium per policy on new business increased 10.4% at december 31, 2022 and new business policies written increased 3.7% in 2022.
premiums generated from renewal business increased 13.9% to $8.5 billion in 2023, and increased 8.5% to $7.5 billion, in 2022.  underlying the trend in renewal business premiums in both periods were increases in year-over-year average premium per policy of 9.0% at december 31, 2023 and 4.7% at december 31, 2022, as well as an increase in year-over-year policies in force of 4.5% and 3.6% in 2023 and 2022, respectively, driven by a slight increase in policy retention ratios.
the exchange implements rate changes in order to meet loss cost expectations. in response to reduced driving conditions in 2020 resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, the exchange implemented $200 million in personal and commercial auto rate reductions on policies written between july 1, 2020 and june 30, 2021, which negatively impacted exchange's written premium in 2021 by approximately $110 million. the exchange began implementing rate increases in 2021 primarily due to increased claims frequency as driving activity returned to near pre-pandemic levels and continued to implement rate increases in 2022 and 2023 primarily as a result of inflation-driven severity increases.
as the exchange writes policies with annual terms only, rate actions take 12 months to be fully recognized in written premium and 24 months to be recognized in earned premiums. since rate changes are realized at renewal, it takes 12 months to implement a rate change to all policyholders and another 12 months to earn the increased or decreased premiums in full. as a result, certain rate changes approved in 2022 were reflected in 2023, and a portion of the rate actions approved in 2023 will be reflected in 2024. furthermore, the exchange writes certain personal auto policies with a rate locking feature, which generally extends the amount of time it takes for rate actions to be recognized. the exchange continuously evaluates pricing and product offerings to meet consumer demands.
personal lines - total personal lines premiums written increased 18.7% to $7.1 billion in 2023, from $6.0 billion in 2022, driven by a 10.5% increase in total personal lines year-over-year average premium per policy and a 7.4% increase in total personal lines policies in force. total personal lines year-over-year average premium per policy increased 4.4% at december 31, 2022 and policies in force increased 3.9% in 2022.
commercial lines - total commercial lines premiums written increased 13.0% to $3.0 billion in 2023, compared to 2022, driven by a 9.5% increase in the total commercial lines year-over-year average premium per policy and a 3.2% increase in total commercial lines policies in force. total commercial lines premiums written increased 11.2% in 2022, compared to 2021, driven by a 9.0% increase in the total commercial lines year-over-year average premium per policy and a 2.0% increase in total commercial lines policies in force.
future trends-premium revenue - through a careful agency selection and monitoring process, the exchange plans to continue efforts to utilize its agency force to increase market penetration in existing operating territories to contribute to future growth.
changes in premium levels attributable to the growth in policies in force directly affect the profitability of the exchange and have a direct bearing on our management fee. our continued focus on underwriting discipline and the maturing of pricing sophistication models have contributed to the exchange's steady policy retention ratios. the continued growth of its policy base is dependent upon the exchange's ability to retain existing and attract new subscribers/policyholders. a lack of new policy growth or the inability to retain existing customers could have an adverse effect on the exchange's premium level growth, and consequently our management fee.
changes in premium levels attributable to rate changes also directly affect the profitability of the exchange and have a direct bearing on our management fee. pricing actions contemplated or taken by the exchange are subject to various regulatory requirements of the states in which it operates. the pricing actions already implemented, or to be implemented, have an effect on the market competitiveness of the exchange's insurance products. such pricing actions, and those of the exchange's competitors, could affect the ability of the exchange's agents to retain and attract new business. we expect the exchange's pricing actions in 2023 to result in an increase in direct written premiums in 2024; however, exposure reductions and/or changes in mix of business as a result of economic conditions could impact the average direct and affiliated assumed premium written by the exchange, as customers may reduce coverages.

policy issuance and renewal services the management fee revenue allocated for providing policy issuance and renewal services was 24.30% of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange for 2023, 2022, and 2021. this portion of the management fee is recognized as revenue when the policy is issued or renewed because it is at that time that the services we provide are substantially complete and the executed insurance policy is transferred to the customer. the increase in management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services was driven by the increase in the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange discussed previously.
service agreement revenue service agreement revenue primarily consists of service charges we collect from subscribers/policyholders for providing multiple payment plans on policies written by the exchange and its property and casualty subsidiaries and also includes late payment and policy reinstatement fees.  the service charges are fixed dollar amounts per billed installment. service agreement revenue also includes fees received from the exchange for the use of shared office space. the increase in service agreement revenue in 2023 and 2022 is primarily due to an increase in shared office space revenue.

commissions - commissions increased $169.0 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by the growth in direct and affiliated assumed written premium, partially offset by a decrease in agent incentive compensation. the profitability component of agent incentive compensation decreased due to higher claims severity and related loss costs in the three-year period ended 2023 compared to the three-year period ended 2022. commissions increased $71.1 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by the growth in direct and affiliated assumed written premium, partially offset by a decrease in agent incentive compensation. the profitability component of agent incentive compensation decreased due to higher claims severity and related loss costs experienced primarily in 2022.
non-commission expense - non-commission expense increased $46.9 million in 2023 compared to 2022. underwriting and policy processing costs increased $9.4 million primarily due to policies in force growth. information technology costs increased $18.6 million primarily due to increased professional fees, personnel costs, and hardware and software costs. administrative and other expenses increased $20.0 million primarily due to an increase in personnel costs. personnel costs in 2023 were impacted by increased compensation including higher estimated costs for incentive plan awards, partially offset by lower pension costs due to an increase in the discount rate compared to 2022. increases in incentive plan costs were driven by improved direct written premium and policies in force growth and indemnity's higher stock price at year-end 2023 compared to 2022.
in 2022, non-commission expense increased $47.1 million compared to 2021. underwriting and policy processing costs increased $6.4 million primarily due to increased underwriting report, printing, and personnel costs. information technology costs increased $13.1 million primarily due to increased hardware and software costs and professional fees, partially offset by decreased personnel costs. sales and advertising costs increased $7.5 million primarily due to increased advertising and agent-related expenses. administrative and other expenses increased $22.5 million primarily due to an increase in personnel costs related to compensation and increased professional fees.

net realized and unrealized losses of $5.8 million in 2023 were primarily due to disposals of available-for-sale and equity securities, partially offset by market value adjustment gains on equity securities. net realized and unrealized losses of $27.3 million in 2022 were primarily due to disposals of available-for-sale securities and market value adjustments on equity securities, while gains of $4.9 million in 2021 were primarily due to disposals of available-for-sale securities.
net impairment (losses) recoveries recognized in earnings net impairment losses of $9.8 million in 2023 include $7.3 million of current expected credit losses recognized on loans receivable related to real estate development projects supporting the revitalization efforts in our community. see "other assets" in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 2, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements" for additional information. impairment losses in 2023 also include $2.4 million related to available-for-sale securities, including $1.8 million of securities in an unrealized loss position where we had intent to sell prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis and $0.7 million of credit impairment losses. net impairment losses of $0.7 million in 2022 were related to available-for-sale securities and include $0.5 million of credit impairment losses and $0.2 million of securities in an unrealized loss position where we had intent to sell prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis. net impairment recoveries of $0.2 million in 2021 were primarily the result of a change in the current expected credit loss allowance related to our agent loans.
financial condition of erie insurance exchange serving in the capacity of attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange, we are dependent on the growth and financial condition of the exchange, who is our sole customer. the strength of the exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries is rated annually by a.m. best through assessing its financial stability and ability to pay claims. the ratings are generally based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward return to investors. the exchange and each of its property and casualty subsidiaries are rated a+ "superior", the second highest financial strength rating, which is assigned to companies that have achieved superior overall performance when compared to the standards established by a.m. best and have a superior ability to meet obligations to policyholders over the long term. on august 10, 2023, the outlook for the financial strength rating was affirmed as stable. as of december 31, 2023, only approximately 12% of insurance groups, in which the exchange is included, are rated a+ or higher.
the financial statements of the exchange are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles prescribed by the commonwealth of pennsylvania. financial statements prepared under statutory accounting principles focus on the solvency of the insurer and generally provide a more conservative approach than under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. statutory direct written premiums of the exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries grew 17.0% to $10.1 billion in 2023 from $8.6 billion in 2022. these premiums, along with investment income, are the major sources of cash that support the operations of the exchange. policyholders' surplus, determined under statutory accounting principles, was $9.3 billion and $10.1 billion at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries' year-over-year policy retention ratio continues to be high at 91.2% at december 31, 2023 and 90.5% at december 31, 2022.
we have prepared our financial statements considering the financial strength of the exchange based on its a.m. best rating and strong level of surplus. see part i, item 1a. "risk factors" for possible outcomes that could impact that determination.

we continually review our investment portfolio for impairment and determine whether the impairment is a result of credit loss or other factors. we analyze all positions with an emphasis on those in a significant unrealized loss position. if we have the intent to sell or it's more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the entire impairment is recognized in earnings. factors considered in the evaluation of credit loss include the extent to which fair value is less than cost and fundamental factors specific to the issuer such as financial condition, changes in credit ratings, near and long-term business prospects and other factors, as well as the likelihood of recovery of the amortized cost of the security. impairment resulting from credit loss is recognized in earnings with a corresponding allowance on the statement of financial position. we believe our investment valuation philosophy and accounting practices result in appropriate and timely measurement of fair value and recognition of impairment.
fixed maturities under our investment strategy, we maintain a fixed maturity portfolio that is of high quality and well diversified within each market sector. this investment strategy also achieves a balanced maturity schedule. our fixed maturity portfolio is managed with the goal of achieving reasonable returns while limiting exposure to risk.
fixed maturities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, included in shareholders' equity. net unrealized losses on fixed maturities, net of deferred taxes, totaled $24.7 million at december 31, 2023, compared to $52.5 million at december 31, 2022. our evaluation of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance included available tax planning strategies that could be implemented, if necessary, to support the realizability of deferred tax assets. we believe those tax strategies are feasible and prudent.

shareholders' equity postretirement benefit plans the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans is recognized in the statements of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. at december 31, 2023, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans decreased by $33.8 million, net of tax, of which $11.0 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial gain and $22.8 million represents the current period actuarial loss.  the 2023 actuarial loss was driven primarily by the lower discount rate used to measure the future benefit obligations, partially offset by higher than expected return on plan assets. at december 31, 2022, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans increased by $76.5 million, net of tax, of which $6.9 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial loss and $69.6 million represents the current period actuarial gain.  the 2022 actuarial gain was driven by the higher discount rate, offset by lower than expected return on plan assets. although we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, there are reimbursements between us and the exchange and its subsidiaries for their allocated share of pension income or cost. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 9, postretirement benefits, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on these reimbursements.
liquidity and capital resources we continue to monitor the sufficiency of our liquidity and capital resources given the potential impact of current economic conditions, including the uncertain inflationary and interest rate environment. while we did not see a significant impact on our sources or uses of cash in 2023, future disruptions in the markets could occur which may affect our liquidity position. if our normal operating and investing cash activities were to become insufficient to meet future funding requirements, we believe we have sufficient access to liquidity through our cash position, diverse liquid marketable securities, and our $100 million bank revolving line of credit that does not expire until october 2026. see broader discussions of potential risks to our operations in part i, item 1a. "risk factors" contained within this report.
sources and uses of cash liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of its business operations and growth needs.  our liquidity requirements have been met primarily by funds generated from management fee revenue and income from investments.  cash provided from these sources is used primarily to fund the costs of our management operations including commissions, salaries and wages, pension plans, share repurchases, dividends to shareholders, the purchase and development of information technology, and other capital expenditures.  we expect that our operating cash needs will be met by funds generated from operations. cash in excess of our operating needs is primarily invested in investment grade fixed maturities. as part of our liquidity review, we regularly evaluate our capital needs based on current and projected results and consider the potential impacts to our liquidity, borrowing capacity, financial covenants and capital availability.
we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under various agreements. cash requirements within the next twelve months include accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and other current obligations.
our long-term cash requirements under various contractual obligations and commitments include:
•pension - we have a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and an unfunded serp for certain members of executive and senior management. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 9, postretirement benefits, of notes to financial statements" for the funding policy and related contributions for our defined benefit pension plan, and accumulated benefit obligation for our unfunded serp.
•deferred compensation - we have two deferred compensation plans for our executives, senior vice presidents, and other selected officers and two deferred compensation plans for our outside directors. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 10, incentive and deferred compensation plans, of notes to financial statements" for additional details of these obligations and estimated future payments.
•home office renovations - we have an agreement with an external contracting firm for renovations to an office building that is part of our principal headquarters. remaining commitments related to the underlying contracts due in the next 12 months totaled $30.8 million at december 31, 2023. additional contracts will be executed as we begin each new phase of the overall renovation project and will be funded using our working capital. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 7, fixed assets, of notes to financial statements" for additional details on construction in progress costs and expected completion date.
•other commitments - we have commitments for approximately $531 million which include agreements for various services, including information technology, support and maintenance obligations, operating leases for equipment, vehicles and real estate, and other obligations in the ordinary course of business. we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms. these agreements are enforceable and legally binding and specify fixed amounts or minimum quantities to be purchased. some agreements may contain cancellation provisions, some of which may require us to pay a termination fee. over half of these commitments are due in the next 12 months. we are reimbursed from the exchange and its subsidiaries for the portion of these costs related to administrative services.
we maintain relationships and cash balances at diversified and well-capitalized financial institutions and have established processes to monitor them. we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our current and future cash requirements.
volatility in the financial markets presents challenges to us as we occasionally access our investment portfolio as a source of cash.  some of our fixed income investments, despite being publicly traded, may be illiquid.  volatility in these markets could impair our ability to sell certain fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs from sources other than the liquidation of securities.
cash flow activities the following table provides condensed cash flow information for the years ended december 31:
(in thousands)                                                                2023                      2022                      2021

net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash                      $1,965                 $(41,612)                   $22,462
net cash provided by operating activities was $381.2 million in 2023, compared to $366.2 million in 2022 and $402.8 million in 2021.  increased cash provided by operating activities in 2023, compared to 2022, was primarily due to an increase in management fees received of $319.2 million driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange. this was partially offset by increases in cash paid for agent commissions of $157.9 million driven by premium growth, pension and employee benefits paid of $101.3 million primarily due to a $95.0 million pension contribution in 2023, and general operating expenses paid of $30.3 million primarily driven by higher information technology-related professional fees and hardware and software costs. decreased cash provided by operating activities in 2022, compared to 2021, was primarily due to increases in cash paid for agent commissions of $75.9 million driven by premium growth, administrative services expenses paid of $35.0 million and a pension contribution of $25.0 million. partially offsetting this decrease in cash provided by operating activities was an increase in management fees received of $118.9 million driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $157.6 million in 2023, compared to $106.9 million in 2022 and $185.5 million in 2021. in 2023 and 2022, net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by fixed asset purchases of $92.6 million and $67.2 million, respectively, mostly related to software and home office renovations. additionally, purchases of investments exceeded proceeds generated from sales and maturities/calls of investments in both periods, while 2023 also included $13.6 million in loans issued to fund real estate development projects supporting revitalization efforts in our community. in 2021, net cash used in investing activities was mainly driven by fixed asset purchases of $148.8 million, which included the purchase of the home office from the exchange. to a lesser extent, purchases of investments exceeded proceeds generated from sales and maturities/calls of investments.
net cash used in financing activities totaled $221.7 million in 2023, compared to $300.8 million in 2022 and $194.8 million in 2021. changes in cash related to financing activities were primarily due to the repayment of the remaining $93.2 million balance on the term loan in 2022.
capital outlook we regularly prepare forecasts evaluating the current and future cash requirements for both normal and extreme risk events, including under current inflationary conditions and a higher interest rate environment.  should an extreme risk event result in a cash requirement exceeding normal cash flows, we have the ability to meet our future funding requirements through various alternatives available to us.
outside of our normal operating and investing cash activities, future funding requirements could be met through: 1) unrestricted and unpledged cash and cash equivalents, which total approximately $128.7 million at december 31, 2023, 2) $100 million available bank revolving line of credit, and 3) liquidation of unpledged assets held in our investment portfolio, including equity securities and investment grade bonds which totaled approximately $799.0 million at december 31, 2023.  volatility in the financial markets could impair our ability to sell certain fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  additionally, we have the ability to curtail or modify discretionary cash outlays such as those related to shareholder dividends and share repurchase activities.
as of december 31, 2023, we have access to a $100 million bank revolving line of credit. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 8, bank line of credit, of notes to financial statements" for additional information.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 16, commitments and contingencies, of notes to financial statements" for additional information. we do not believe that these obligations will have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
enterprise risk management the role of our enterprise risk management ("erm") function is to ensure that all significant risks are clearly identified, understood, proactively managed and consistently monitored to achieve strategic objectives for all stakeholders. our erm program views risk holistically across our entire group of companies. it ensures implementation of risk responses to mitigate potential impacts. see part i, item 1a. "risk factors" contained in this report for a list of risk factors.
our erm process is founded on a governance framework that includes oversight at multiple levels of our organization, including our board of directors and executive management. accountability to identify, manage, and mitigate risk is embedded within all functions and areas of our business. we have defined risk tolerances to monitor and manage significant risks within acceptable levels. in addition to identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, monitoring, and mitigating significant risks, our erm process includes extreme event analyses and scenario testing. given our defined tolerance for risk, risk model output is used to quantify the potential variability of future performance and the sufficiency of capital and liquidity levels.
transactions/agreements with related parties board oversight our board of directors has a broad oversight responsibility over our intercompany relationships with the exchange.  thus, our board of directors may be required to make decisions or take actions that may benefit subscribers at the exchange and the overall health of the exchange. these actions may ultimately benefit our shareholders.
insurance holding company system most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems, defined as two or more affiliated persons, one or more of which is an insurer. the exchange has the following wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries: erie insurance company, erie insurance company of new york, erie insurance property & casualty company and flagship city insurance company, and a wholly owned life insurance company, erie family life insurance company. indemnity and the exchange, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, meet the definition of an insurance holding company system.
transactions within a holding company system affecting the member insurers of the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and any charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable.  approval by the applicable insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of certain transactions affecting the members within a holding company system.
intercompany agreements subscriber's and services agreements we serve as attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange, a reciprocal insurance exchange.  each applicant for insurance to a reciprocal insurance exchange (a subscriber) signs a subscriber's agreement that contains an appointment of an attorney-in-fact.  through the designation of attorney-in-fact, we are required to provide policy issuance and renewal services and act as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange with respect to all administrative services, as discussed previously.  in accordance with the subscriber's agreement, we retain a management fee for these services calculated as a percentage of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange. consistent with its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the exchange does not have any employees or officers. therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the subscribers' attorney-in-fact. the exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize indemnity for all administrative services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and indemnity. the subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to indemnity.  reimbursements are settled at cost on a monthly basis. state insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.
shared facilities the exchange and its subsidiaries have a service agreement with indemnity to use space in indemnity-owned properties. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 14, related party, of notes to financial statements" for additional details.
cost allocation the allocation of costs affects our financial condition and that of the exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries. management's role is to determine that allocations are consistently made in accordance with the subscriber's agreement with the subscribers at the exchange, intercompany service agreements, and applicable insurance laws and regulations. allocation of costs under these various agreements requires judgment and interpretation by indemnity, and such allocations are performed using a consistent methodology, which is intended to adhere to the terms and intentions of the underlying agreements.
intercompany receivables we have significant receivables from the exchange and its affiliates that result in a concentration of credit risk. net receivables from the exchange and other affiliates were $625.3 million, or 25.3% of total assets, at december 31, 2023 and $524.9 million, or 23.4% of total assets, at december 31, 2022. these receivables include management fees due for policy issuance and renewal services performed by us under the subscriber's agreement, and certain costs we incur acting as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the exchange as well as the service provider for the exchange's insurance subsidiaries with respect to all administrative services, as discussed previously. these receivables from the exchange and other affiliates are settled monthly. we continually monitor the financial strength of the exchange.
other loans receivable in december 2023, we issued two senior secured loans totaling $13.6 million to fund a real estate development project supporting revitalization efforts in our community. ownership in the project includes related party and unrelated investors. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 14,  related party, of notes to financial statements" for additional details.

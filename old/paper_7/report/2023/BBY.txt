item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude. our md&a should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k. refer to item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, in our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 28, 2023, for discussion of the results of operations for the year ended january 28, 2023, compared to the year ended january 29, 2022, which is incorporated by reference herein.
overview we are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. we accomplish this by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch to meet our customers' everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. we have operations in the u.s. and canada.
we have two reportable segments: domestic and international. the domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the u.s. and our best buy health business, and includes the brand names best buy, best buy ads, best buy business, best buy health, cst, current health, geek squad, lively, magnolia, pacific kitchen and home, techliquidators and yardbird; and the domain names bestbuy.com, currenthealth.com, lively.com, techliquidators.com and yardbird.com. the international segment is comprised of all operations in canada under the brand names best buy, best buy mobile and geek squad and the domain name bestbuy.ca.
our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest the end of january. fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 ended february 3, 2024, january 28, 2023, and january 29, 2022, respectively. unless otherwise noted, references to years in the md&a section of this report relate to fiscal years, and not calendar years. fiscal 2024 included 53 weeks with the 53rd week occurring in the fiscal fourth quarter. fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 each included 52 weeks. our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. a large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.
comparable sales throughout this md&a, we refer to comparable sales. comparable sales is a metric used by management to evaluate the performance of our existing stores, websites and call centers by measuring the change in net sales for a particular period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length. comparable sales includes revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months. revenue from online sales is included in comparable sales and represents sales initiated on a website or app, regardless of whether customers choose to pick up product in store, curbside, at an alternative pick-up location or take delivery direct to their homes. revenue from acquisitions is included in comparable sales beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. comparable sales also includes credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable. revenue from stores closed more than 14 days, including but not limited to relocated, remodeled, expanded and downsized stores, or stores impacted by natural disasters, is excluded from comparable sales until at least 14 full months after reopening. comparable sales excludes the impact of profit-share revenue, the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (applicable to our international segment only) and the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. all periods presented apply this methodology consistently.
we believe comparable sales is a meaningful supplemental metric for investors to evaluate revenue performance resulting from growth in existing stores, websites and call centers versus the portion resulting from opening new stores or closing existing stores. the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. as a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods.
non-gaap financial measures this md&a includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. ("gaap"), as well as certain adjusted or non-gaap financial measures, such as non-gaap operating income, non-gaap effective tax rate and non-gaap diluted earnings per share ("eps"). we believe that non-gaap financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with gaap financial measures, provide additional useful information for evaluating current period performance and assessing future performance. for these reasons, internal management reporting, including budgets, forecasts and financial targets used for short-term incentives are based on non-gaap financial measures. generally, our non-gaap financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, price-fixing settlements, gains and losses on sales of subsidiaries and certain investments, intangible asset amortization, certain acquisition-related costs and the tax effect of all such items. in addition, certain other items may be excluded from non-gaap financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors. we provide reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures presented in accordance with gaap to presented non-gaap financial measures that enable investors to understand the adjustments made in arriving at the non-gaap financial measures and to evaluate performance using the same metrics as management. these non-gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, gaap financial measures. we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. non-gaap financial measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting their usefulness for comparative purposes.
in our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our international segment, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the international segment's operating results from local currencies into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes. we also may use the term "constant currency," which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts. we calculate those impacts as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates. we believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates.
refer to the non-gaap financial measures section below for detailed reconciliations of items impacting non-gaap operating income, non-gaap effective tax rate and non-gaap diluted eps in the presented periods.‎
business strategy update during fiscal 2024, our teams once again delivered strong execution and showcased their ability to navigate through what continues to be a challenging environment for our industry, while keeping our customers and their experiences as our top priority. we continue to balance the need to adjust in response to current industry sales trends with the need to invest in our business so that we can capitalize on opportunities as our industry moves through this downturn and returns to expected growth.
in fiscal 2024, digital sales comprised 33% of our domestic revenue compared to 19% in fiscal 2020. during these same time periods, the percentage of online sales picked up in our stores by our customers was consistent at just over 40%. therefore, we are continuing to adapt our omnichannel capabilities to ensure we maintain a leading position in an increasingly digital age and evolving retail landscape.
we believe our portfolio of stores are crucial assets that provide customers with differentiated experiences, services and convenient multichannel fulfillment. at the same time, our stores need to be cost and capital efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. during fiscal 2024, we closed 24 large format stores and implemented 8 large format experience store remodels. as we look to fiscal 2025, we plan to invest back into our store experience. customer shopping behavior has evolved in the last four years, and in the near-term we are particularly focused on ensuring we provide the experience that customers expect to have when they take the time to come into our stores. as a result, our capital investments for fiscal 2025 are concentrated more on existing store updates and refreshes and less on major remodels or store openings.
we continue to advance our omni-channel operating model to align with the ongoing evolution of our industry and marketplace trends with two overarching goals in mind - efficiently allocating our labor cost, considering the channel shift from our physical stores to online, and providing our employees flexibility, predictability and opportunities to gain more skills. we are focused on balancing the amount of labor hours necessary to deliver the best experience possible for our customers and other stakeholders.
during fiscal 2024, we continued to grow our membership base and ended the year with a total of approximately seven million paid members. our paid members consistently showed higher levels of interaction, with comparatively higher levels of spend at best buy and a shift of spend away from competitors. last june, we successfully launched significant changes to our membership program that allow customers more freedom to choose a membership that fits their technology needs, budget and shopping preferences. in addition, we expect the changes to provide more flexibility to evolve our programs while resulting in a lower cost to serve than our previous paid membership program, which we have already seen results in margin favorability.
although there continue to be macro pressures impacting retail overall and consumer electronics more specifically, we expect fiscal 2025 to be a year of increasing industry stabilization as the pace of innovation increases and consumers begin to upgrade and replace technology products bought earlier in the pandemic. our strategy is to focus on sharpening our customer experiences and industry positioning while maintaining, if not expanding, our profitability.
we remain excited about our industry and our future. there are more technology products than ever in people's homes, technology is increasingly a necessity in our lives, and we believe we are uniquely there for our customers as they navigate this vibrant, ever-changing and innovative space.

(1)because retailers vary in how they record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of sales and sg&a, our gross profit rate and sg&a rate may not be comparable to other retailers' corresponding rates. for additional information regarding costs classified in cost of sales and sg&a, refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k.
in fiscal 2024, we generated $43.5 billion in revenue, including approximately $735 million in revenue from the 53rd week. our comparable sales declined 6.8% in fiscal 2024, as we continued to operate in a consumer electronics industry that is challenged by various macroeconomic pressures, including high inflation, increased spending outside the home in areas such as travel and entertainment, the pull-forward of demand in prior years and lower levels of product innovation.‎
revenue, gross profit rate, sg&a and operating income rate changes in fiscal 2024 were primarily driven by our domestic segment. for further discussion of our domestic and international segments, see segment performance summary, below.
income tax expense income tax expense increased in fiscal 2024, primarily due to reduced benefits from the resolution of tax matters and stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of decreased pre-tax earnings. our effective tax rate increased in fiscal 2024, primarily due to reduced tax benefits from the resolution of tax matters and stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of lower pre-tax earnings.

domestic revenue was $40.1 billion in fiscal 2024, including approximately $675 million of revenue from the 53rd week. the decrease in domestic revenue in fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by comparable sales declines in home theater, large appliances, computing and mobile phones, partially offset by comparable sales growth in gaming hardware. online revenue of $13.1 billion decreased 7.8% on a comparable basis in fiscal 2024. these decreases in revenue were primarily due to the factors described within the consolidated results section, above.

we continuously monitor store performance as part of a market-driven, omnichannel strategy. as we approach the expiration of leases, we evaluate various options for each location, including whether a store should remain open. in fiscal 2025, we currently expect to close approximately 10 to 15 best buy stores.

notable comparable sales changes by revenue category were as follows:
• computing and mobile phones: the 7.8% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by computing, mobile phones and tablets.
• consumer electronics: the 8.6% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by home theater.
• appliances: the 15.1% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by large appliances.
• entertainment: the 9.7% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by gaming hardware.
• services: the 8.7% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by growth in our membership programs, as well as delivery and installation services.
domestic gross profit rate increased in fiscal 2024, primarily due to improved financial performance from our membership offerings, which included higher services margin rates, and an improved gross profit rate from our best buy health business.
domestic sg&a decreased in fiscal 2024, primarily due to lower store payroll and advertising expense, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense and the impact of the 53rd week.
domestic restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2024 were primarily comprised of employee termination benefits related to an enterprise-wide initiative that commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. the restructuring initiative is intended to accomplish the following: (1) align field labor resources with where customers want to shop to optimize the customer experience; (2) redirect corporate resources for better alignment with our strategy; and (3) right-size resources to better align with our revenue outlook in fiscal 2025. refer to note 3, restructuring, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
domestic operating income rate decreased in fiscal 2024, primarily due to an unfavorable sg&a rate that was driven by decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses, partially offset by favorability in gross profit rate.

international revenue was $3.4 billion in fiscal 2024, including approximately $60 million of revenue from the 53rd week. the decrease in international revenue in fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by comparable sales declines across most of our product categories and the negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.

notable comparable sales changes by revenue category were as follows:
• computing and mobile phones: the 0.9% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by computing, partially offset by comparable sales growth in mobile phones.
• consumer electronics: the 9.3% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by home theater and health and fitness.
• appliances: the 4.5% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by large appliances.
• entertainment: the 13.2% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by gaming hardware.
• services: the 1.0% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by growth in our membership programs.
international gross profit rate decreased in fiscal 2024, primarily driven by lower product margin rates, partially offset by a higher mix of revenue from the higher-margin services category.
international sg&a increased in fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and the impact of the 53rd week, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
international restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2024 were primarily comprised of employee termination benefits related to the enterprise-wide initiative that commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. refer to note 3, restructuring, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
international operating income rate decreased in fiscal 2024, primarily due to an unfavorable sg&a rate that was driven by decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses and an unfavorable gross profit rate.

(2)represents charges associated with acquisitions, including: (1) the non-cash amortization of definite-lived intangible assets, including customer relationships, tradenames and developed technology; and (2) acquisition-related transaction and due diligence costs, primarily comprised of professional fees.
(3)represents restructuring charges primarily related to the fiscal 2024 restructuring initiative, the fiscal 2023 resource optimization initiative and the mexico exit and strategic realignment.
(4)represents the gain on sale of a mexico subsidiary subsequent to our exit from operations in mexico.
(5)the non-gaap adjustments primarily relate to the u.s. as such, the income tax charge on the u.s. non-gaap adjustments is calculated using the u.s. statutory tax rate of 24.5%.
non-gaap operating income rate decreased in fiscal 2024, primarily due to unfavorable sg&a rates in our domestic and international segments, partially offset by a favorable gross profit rate in our domestic segment.
non-gaap effective tax rate increased in fiscal 2024, primarily due to reduced tax benefits from the resolution of tax matters and stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of lower pre-tax earnings.
non-gaap diluted eps decreased in fiscal 2024, primarily driven by the decrease in non-gaap operating income, partially offset by lower diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.
liquidity and capital resources we closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment required to support our business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, dividends, credit facilities, short-term borrowing arrangements and working capital management. we modify our approach to managing these variables as changes in our operating environment arise. for example, capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy, which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment.
cash and cash equivalents were as follows ($ in millions):
february 3, 2024        january 28, 2023
cash and cash equivalents   $1,447                  $1,874
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by dividend payments, capital expenditures and share repurchases. these decreases were partially offset by positive cash flows from operations, primarily driven by earnings.
our cash deposits held at financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit. we limit exposure relating to financial instruments by diversifying the financial instruments among various counterparties, which consist primarily of major financial institutions.
cash flows cash flows were as follows ($ in millions):

operating activities the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to the timing and volume of inventory purchases and payments, higher income tax payments and lower earnings. this was partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments in the current year as a result of less favorable fiscal 2023 results, and higher vendor funding collections.
investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal 2024, primarily driven by lower capital spending.
financing activities the decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by lower share repurchases.
sources of liquidity funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, our credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables are our most significant sources of liquidity. we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and strategic initiatives, including business combinations. however, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending. there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms.
on april 12, 2023, we entered into a $1.25 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the "five-year facility agreement") with a syndicate of banks. the five-year facility agreement replaced the previous $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "previous facility") with a syndicate of banks, which was entered into in may 2021 and scheduled to expire in may 2026, but was terminated on april 12, 2023. the five-year facility agreement permits borrowings of up to $1.25 billion and expires in april 2028. there were no borrowings outstanding under the five-year facility agreement as of february 3, 2024, or the previous facility as of january 28, 2023.
our ability to continue to access the five-year facility agreement is subject to our compliance with its terms and conditions, including financial covenants. the financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. as of february 3, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. if an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt, it would likely constitute an event of default under the five-year facility agreement as well.
our credit ratings and outlook as of march 13, 2024, remained unchanged from those disclosed in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 28, 2023, and are summarized below.
rating agency           rating   outlook standard &amp; poor's   bbb+     stable moody's                 a3       stable credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically, and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. if changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other things, interest costs for certain of our credit facilities, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new-store leasing costs.
restricted cash our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are primarily restricted to cover product protection plans provided under our membership offerings and other self-insurance liabilities. restricted cash, which is included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets, remained relatively stable in fiscal 2024, with balances of $346 million and $379 million as of february 3, 2024, and january 28, 2023, respectively.
capital expenditures capital expenditures were as follows ($ in millions):

(1)store-related projects are primarily comprised of store remodels and various merchandising projects.
we currently expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 of $750 million to $800 million.
debt and capital as of february 3, 2024, we had $500 million of principal amount of notes due october 1, 2028 ("2028 notes") and $650 million of principal amount of notes due october 1, 2030 ("2030 notes"). refer to note 8, debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for further information about our outstanding debt.
share repurchases and dividends we repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our board. the payment of cash dividends is also subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. our share repurchase plans are evaluated on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as our financial condition and cash flows, our economic outlook, the impact of tax laws, our liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets. the timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on such factors.
on february 28, 2022, our board approved a $5.0 billion share repurchase program, which replaced the $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized on february 16, 2021. there is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under this authorization.
share repurchase and dividend activity were as follows ($ and shares in millions, except per share amounts):

the total cost of shares repurchased decreased in fiscal 2024 from decreases in the volume of repurchases and the average price per share. we currently expect to spend approximately $350 million on share repurchases in fiscal 2025.
cash dividends declared and paid increased in fiscal 2024, primarily due to an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend per share, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. on february 29, 2024, we announced the board's approval of a 2% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to $0.94 per share.
other financial measures our current ratio, calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities, remained unchanged at 1.0 as of february 3, 2024, and january 28, 2023.
our debt to earnings ratio, calculated as total debt (including current portion) divided by net earnings over the trailing twelve months increased to 0.9 as of february 3, 2024, compared to 0.8 at january 28, 2023, primarily due to lower net earnings.
off-balance-sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we do not have outstanding off-balance-sheet arrangements. contractual obligations as of february 3, 2024, were as follows ($ in millions):

for additional information regarding the nature of contractual obligations discussed below, refer to note 6, derivative instruments; note 7, leases; note 8, debt; and note 13, contingencies and commitments, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k.
(1)purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. additionally, although they do not contain legally binding purchase commitments, we included open purchase orders in the table above. substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days.
(2)lease obligations exclude $118 million of legally binding fixed costs for leases signed but not yet commenced.
(3)operating lease obligations exclude payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. these charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by $0.7 billion as of february 3, 2024.
(4)long-term debt obligations represent principal amounts only and exclude interest rate swap valuation adjustments.
(5)interest payments related to our 2028 notes and 2030 notes include the variable interest rate payments included in our interest rate swaps.
additionally, we have $1.25 billion in undrawn capacity on our five-year facility agreement as of february 3, 2024, which, if drawn upon, would be included in either short-term or long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. we base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k. we have not made any material changes to our accounting policies or methodologies during the past three fiscal years. we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. these estimates require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and generally incorporate significant uncertainty.
vendor allowances description we receive funds from our merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, primarily in the form of purchases-based or sales-based volumes and for product advertising and placement. we recognize allowances based on purchases and sales as a reduction of cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. allowances for advertising and placement are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales ratably over the corresponding performance period. funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor's products are recorded as an offset to the related expense within sg&a when incurred.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate due to the quantity and diverse nature of our vendor agreements, estimates are made to determine the amount of funding to be recognized in earnings or deferred as an offset to inventory. these estimates require a detailed analysis of complex factors, including proper classification of the type of funding received and the methodology to estimate the portion of purchases-based funding that should be recognized in cost of sales in each period, which considers factors such as inventory turn by product category and actual sell-through of inventory.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a 10% change in our vendor funding deferral as of february 3, 2024, would have affected net earnings by approximately $44 million in fiscal 2024. the level of vendor funding deferral has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.
goodwill description goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. the impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. fair value reflects our estimate of the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction.
we have goodwill in two reporting units - best buy domestic (comprising our core u.s. best buy business) and best buy health - with carrying values of $492 million and $891 million, respectively, as of february 3, 2024.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires complex analysis and judgment. we use a combination of discounted cash flow ("dcf") models and market data, such as revenue multiples and quoted market prices, for observable comparable companies. dcf models require detailed forecasts of cash flow drivers, such as revenue growth rates, margin rates and capital investments and estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. these estimates incorporate many uncertain factors, such as the effectiveness of our strategy, changes in customer behavior, technological changes, competitor actions, regulatory changes and macroeconomic trends.
effects if actual results differ from assumptions for our best buy domestic reporting unit, fair value exceeded book value by a substantial margin in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. barring a fundamental, material deterioration of macroeconomic factors, we believe the risk of future goodwill impairment within our best buy domestic reporting unit is remote.
our best buy health reporting unit is subject to a greater level of uncertainty, since it operates in a less mature, rapidly-changing and high-growth environment. for fiscal 2024, the fair value of the best buy health reporting unit exceeded its book value by approximately 30%, compared to approximately 40% in fiscal 2023. the primary reason for the decrease in this excess was lower revenue projections. further declines in the excess of fair value over book value could arise in future years, which could lead to an impairment of goodwill. factors that drive this uncertainty include macro-economic conditions, the regulatory environment, competitor actions, technology changes and trends in the health and care sectors.
inventory markdown description we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through the establishment of inventory markdown adjustments. markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis. no adjustment is recorded for inventory that we expect to return to our vendors for full credit.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment about the expected revenue and incremental costs we will generate for selling current inventory. such estimates include the evaluation of historical recovery rates, as well as factors such as product type and condition, forecasted consumer demand, product lifecycles, promotional environment, vendor return rights and the expected sales channel of ultimate disposition. we also apply judgment in the assumptions about other components of net realizable value, such as vendor allowances and selling costs.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a 10% change in our markdown adjustment as of february 3, 2024, would have affected net earnings by approximately $11 million in fiscal 2024. the level of markdown adjustments has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.
tax contingencies description our income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. taxing authorities audit our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. at any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures. a number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. such assumptions can include complex and uncertain external factors, such as changes in tax law, interpretations of tax law and the timing of such changes, and uncertain internal factors such as taxable earnings by jurisdiction, the magnitude and timing of certain transactions and capital spending.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. see note 11, income taxes, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
service revenue description we sell membership plans that include access to benefits such as technical support, price discounts on certain products and services and product protection plans. we allocate the transaction price to all performance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative fair value. for performance obligations provided over the term of the contract, we typically recognize revenue on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term. this method involves the estimation of expected usage patterns, primarily derived from historical information.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate estimates involve complex calculations and judgment, for example, in estimating the relative standalone selling price for bundled performance obligations; the appropriate recognition methodology for each performance obligation; and, for those based on usage, the expected pattern of consumption across a large portfolio of customers. when insufficient reliable and relevant history is available to estimate usage, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract until such history has accumulated.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a 10% change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of february 3, 2024, would have affected net earnings by approximately $44 million in fiscal 2024. the amount of services membership deferred revenue has increased over the last three fiscal years, primarily driven by the national launch of our best buy total membership offering, which resulted in higher membership sales and the initial deferral of more revenue than under the previous offerings.

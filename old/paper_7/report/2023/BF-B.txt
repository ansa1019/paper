item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to help the reader better understand brown-forman, our operations, our financial results, and our current business environment. please read this md&a in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" (consolidated financial statements).
our md&a is organized as follows:

presentation basis non-gaap financial measures we use some financial measures in this report that are not measures of financial performance under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). these non-gaap measures, defined below, should be viewed as supplements to (not substitutes for) our results of operations and other measures reported under gaap. other companies may not define or calculate these non-gaap measures in the same way.
"organic change" in measures of statements of operations. we present changes in certain measures, or line items, of the statements of operations that are adjusted to an "organic" basis. we use "organic change" for the following measures of the statements of operations: (a) organic net sales; (b) organic cost of sales; (c) organic gross profit; (d) organic advertising expenses; (e) organic selling, general, and administrative (sg&a) expenses; (f) organic other expense (income) net; (g) organic operating expenses1; and (h) organic operating income. to calculate these measures, we adjust, as applicable, for (1) acquisitions and divestitures, (2) foreign exchange, and (3) impairment charges. we explain these adjustments below.
•"acquisitions and divestitures." this adjustment removes (a) the gain or loss recognized on sale of divested brands, (b) any non-recurring effects related to our acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., transaction, transition, and integration costs or income), and (c) the effects of operating activity related to acquired and divested brands for periods not comparable year over year (non-comparable periods). excluding non-comparable periods allows us to include the effects of acquired and divested brands only to the extent that results are comparable year over year.
during fiscal 2021, we sold our early times, canadian mist, and collingwood brands and related assets, and entered into a related transition services agreement (tsa) for these brands. during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we acquired gin mare brand, s.l.u. and mareliquid vantguard, s.l.u., which own the gin mare brand (gin mare). also, during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we acquired (a) international rum and spirits distributors unipessoal, lda., (b) diplomático branding unipessoal lda., (c) international bottling services, s.a., (d) international rum & spirits marketing solutions, s.l., and (e) certain assets of destilerias unidas corp., which collectively own the diplomático rum brand and related assets (diplomático). see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
this adjustment removes (a) the net sales and operating expenses recognized pursuant to the tsa related to the divestiture of early times, canadian mist, and collingwood brands and related assets for the non-comparable period, which is activity during the first quarter of fiscal 2022; (b) transaction, transition, and integration costs related to the acquisitions; (c) operating activity for gin mare for the non-comparable period, which is activity in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023; and (d) operating activity for diplomático for the non-comparable period, which is activity in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023. we believe that these adjustments allow for us to understand our organic results on a comparable basis.
1 operating expenses include advertising expense, sg&a expense, and other expense (income), net.
•"foreign exchange." we calculate the percentage change in certain line items of the statements of operations in accordance with gaap and adjust to exclude the cost or benefit of currency fluctuations. adjusting for foreign exchange allows us to understand our business on a constant-dollar basis, as fluctuations in exchange rates can distort the organic trend both positively and negatively. (in this report, "dollar" always means the u.s. dollar unless stated otherwise.) to eliminate the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations when comparing across periods, we translate current-year results at prior-year rates and remove transactional and hedging foreign exchange gains and losses from current- and prior-year periods.
•"impairment charges." this adjustment removes the impact of impairment charges from our results of operations.
during the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $9 million for certain fixed assets. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $52 million for our finlandia brand name. during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we recognized an additional non-cash impairment charge of $96 million for the finlandia brand name. see "critical accounting policies and estimates" below and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. we believe that these adjustments allow for us to understand our organic results on a comparable basis.
we use the non-gaap measure "organic change", along with other metrics, to: (a) understand our performance from period to period on a consistent basis; (b) compare our performance to that of our competitors; (c) calculate components of management incentive compensation; (d) plan and forecast; and (e) communicate our financial performance to the board of directors, stockholders, and investment community. we provide reconciliations of the "organic change" in certain line items of the statements of operations to their nearest gaap measures in the tables under "results of operations - fiscal 2023 highlights" and "results of operations - year-over-year comparisons." we have consistently applied the adjustments within our reconciliations in arriving at each non-gaap measure. we believe these non-gaap measures are useful to readers and investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance by improving comparability across periods.
"return on average invested capital." this measure refers to the sum of net income and after-tax interest expense, divided by average invested capital. average invested capital equals assets less liabilities, excluding interest-bearing debt, and is calculated using the average of the most recent five quarter-end balances. after-tax interest expense equals interest expense multiplied by one minus our effective tax rate. we use this non-gaap measure because we consider it to be a meaningful indicator of how effectively and efficiently we invest capital in our business.
in fiscal 2023, we changed the methodology used to determine average invested capital. previously, average invested capital was computed using the average of the most recent 13 month-end balances. average invested capital is now calculated using the average of the most recent five quarter-end balances, which are disclosed in the relevant quarterly reports on form 10-q and annual reports on form 10-k. return on average invested capital computed using the new methodology does not materially differ from the total computed using the previous methodology for fiscal 2023. the new methodology was consistently applied to return on average invested capital for each period presented.
definitions aggregations.
from time to time, to explain our results of operations or to highlight trends and uncertainties affecting our business, we aggregate markets according to stage of economic development as defined by the international monetary fund (imf), and we aggregate brands by beverage alcohol category. below, we define the geographic and brand aggregations used in this report.

other metrics.
•"shipments." we generally record revenues when we ship or deliver our products to our customers. in this report, unless otherwise specified, we refer to shipments when discussing volume.
•"depletions." this is a term commonly used in the beverage alcohol industry to describe volume. depending on the context, depletions usually means either (a) where brown-forman is the distributor, shipments directly to retail or wholesale customers or (b) where brown-forman is not the distributor, shipments from distributor customers to retailers and wholesalers. we believe that depletions measure volume in a way that more closely reflects consumer demand than our shipments to distributor customers do.
•"consumer takeaway." when discussing trends in the market, we refer to consumer takeaway, a term commonly used in the beverage alcohol industry that refers to the purchase of product by consumers from retail outlets, including products purchased through e-commerce channels, as measured by volume or retail sales value. this information is provided by third parties, such as nielsen and the national alcohol beverage control association (nabca). our estimates of market share or changes in market share are derived from consumer takeaway data using the retail sales value metric. we believe consumer takeaway is a leading indicator of consumer demand trends.
•"estimated net change in distributor inventories." we generally recognize revenue when our products are shipped or delivered to customers. in the united states and certain other markets, our customers are distributors that sell downstream to retailers and consumers. we believe that our distributors' downstream sales more closely reflect actual consumer demand than do our shipments to distributors. our shipments increase distributors' inventories, while distributors' depletions (as described above) reduce their inventories. therefore, it is possible that our shipments do not coincide with distributors' downstream depletions and merely reflect changes in distributors' inventories. because changes in distributors' inventories could affect our trends, we believe it is useful for investors to understand those changes in the context of our operating results.
we perform the following calculation to determine the "estimated net change in distributor inventories":
•for both the current-year period and the comparable prior-year period, we calculate a "depletion-based" amount by (a) dividing the organic dollar amount (e.g. organic net sales) by the corresponding shipment volumes to arrive at a shipment per case amount, and (b) multiplying the resulting shipment per case amount by the corresponding depletion volumes. we subtract the year-over-year percentage change of the "depletion-based" amount from the year-over-year percentage change of the organic amount to calculate the "estimated net change in distributor inventories."
•a positive difference is interpreted as a net increase in distributors' inventories, which implies that organic trends could decrease as distributors reduce inventories; whereas, a negative difference is interpreted as a net decrease in distributors' inventories, which implies that organic trends could increase as distributors rebuild inventories.
significant developments below we discuss the significant developments in our business during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. these developments relate to finlandia brand name impairments, tariffs, acquisitions, russia's invasion of ukraine, supply chain disruptions, innovation, and capital deployment.
finlandia impairments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $52 million for the finlandia brand name, reflecting a decline in our long-term outlook for finlandia due to our suspension of operations in russia, a key market for the brand. during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $96 million for the finlandia brand name, largely due to macroeconomic conditions including rising interest rates and increasing costs. see "critical accounting policies and estimates" below and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
tariffs the removal of the european union and united kingdom tariffs on american whiskey (tariffs) positively affected our results during fiscal 2023. tariffs include the combined effect of tariff-related costs, whether arising as a reduction of reported net sales or as an increase in reported cost of sales. we estimate that lower costs associated with tariffs (a) reduced our reported cost of sales growth by approximately four percentage points, and (b) increased gross margin by approximately one and a half percentage points.
acquisitions during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we acquired the gin mare brand and the diplomático brand and related assets. operating activity for these acquired brands increased reported net sales growth by approximately half a percentage point and decreased reported operating income growth by approximately four percentage points during fiscal 2023. the negative effect on reported operating income was largely driven by transaction expenses of $44 million related to the termination of certain distribution contracts (certain post-closing costs and expenses).
russia's invasion of ukraine due to russia's invasion of ukraine in february 2022, reported net sales were negatively affected by the suspension of our commercial operations in russia and our diminished ability to conduct business in ukraine.
supply chain disruptions supply chain disruptions continued to affect our business during fiscal 2023. our glass supply position improved, while global logistics and transportation challenges constrained product movement and increased transportation costs.
we further discuss the effects of these developments on our results where relevant below.
innovation
•jack daniel's family of brands. innovation within the jack daniel's family of brands has contributed to our growth in the last two fiscal years as described below.
◦in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, we continued the international launch of jack daniel's tennessee apple, expanding to certain developed international and emerging markets.
◦in fiscal 2022, we launched jack daniel's 10 year old in the united states.
◦in fiscal 2023, we announced our global relationship with the coca-cola company to introduce the jack daniel's & coca-cola rtd to select markets around the world. we discuss the impact of this product launch on our fiscal 2023 results where relevant below.
◦in fiscal 2023, we launched jack daniel's bonded tennessee whiskey and jack daniel's triple mash blended straight whiskey in the united states and certain developed international and emerging markets.
◦in fiscal 2023, we launched jack daniel's 12 year old in the united states.
◦in fiscal 2023, we launched jack daniel's tennessee travelers whiskey in travel retail.
capital deployment we have focused our capital deployment initiatives on (a) fully investing in our existing business, (b) continued execution of our acquisitions and divestitures strategy, and (c) returning cash to our stockholders through regular and special dividends.
•investments. during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, our capital expenditures totaled $321 million and focused on enabling the growth of our premium whiskey and tequila brands:
◦during fiscal 2021, our board of directors approved a $125 million capital investment to expand our bourbon-making capacity in kentucky. we expect to complete this project in fiscal 2024.
◦during fiscal 2022, our board of directors approved a $50 million capital investment to expand our scotch-making capacity in scotland. we also built an additional barrel warehouse at our glendronach distillery during fiscal 2023 to support the continued growth of glendronach.
◦during fiscal 2023, our board of directors approved an $85 million capital investment to expand our jdtw capacity in tennessee. we also built three additional barrel warehouses at our jack daniel's distillery during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 to support the continued growth of jdtw.
◦we recently announced a $200 million capital investment to expand our tequila-making capacity in mexico.
•acquisitions and divestitures. during fiscal 2023, we acquired the gin mare brand and the diplomático brand and related assets. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
•cash returned to stockholders. during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, we returned $1.2 billion to our stockholders through regular and special dividends.
executive summary fiscal 2023 highlights
•we delivered reported net sales of $4.2 billion, an increase of 8% compared to fiscal 2022. reported net sales growth was driven by higher volumes and favorable price/mix, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange. organic net sales increased 10% compared to fiscal 2022.
◦from a brand perspective, reported net sales growth was driven by premium bourbons, ready-to-drinks, our tequilas, and jdtw.
◦from a geographic perspective, emerging markets, the united states, developed international markets, and the travel retail channel all contributed significantly to reported net sales growth.
•we delivered reported operating income of $1.1 billion, a decrease of 6% compared to fiscal 2022, reflecting lower gross margin, higher non-cash impairment charges (largely related to the finlandia brand name), and higher operating expenses (including certain post-closing costs and expenses in connection with the acquisitions of diplomático and gin mare). organic operating income increased 8% compared to fiscal 2022.
•we delivered diluted earnings per share of $1.63, a decrease of 7% compared to fiscal 2022, due to the decrease in reported operating income, partially offset by the benefit of a lower effective tax rate.
•our return on average invested capital decreased to 15.3% in fiscal 2023, compared to 17.6% in fiscal 2022. this decrease was driven by higher invested capital and lower reported operating income, partially offset by the benefit of a lower effective tax rate.

whiskey
•jdtw generates a significant percentage of our total net sales and is our top priority. reported net sales increased 3%, driven by (a) higher volumes in developed international markets and emerging markets, partially reflecting an estimated net increase in distributor inventories; and (b) higher prices. this growth was partially offset by lower volumes in the united states, largely due to an estimated net decrease in distributor inventories, and the negative effect of foreign exchange.

1operating expenses include advertising expense, sg&a expense, and other expense (income), net.
reported operating expenses totaled $1.4 billion and increased $180 million, or 15%, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. the increase in reported operating expenses was driven by (a) higher reported advertising expense; (b) higher reported sg&a expense; (c) certain post-closing costs and expenses in connection with the acquisitions of diplomático and gin mare; and (d) higher non-cash impairment charges, largely related to the finlandia brand name, partially offset by the positive effect of foreign exchange.
•reported advertising expenses increased 15% in fiscal 2023, driven by (a) increased investment for jdtw and herradura, primarily in the united states; and (b) the launch of jack daniel's bonded tennessee whiskey and the jack daniel's & coca-cola rtd in the united states. this increase was partially offset by the positive effect of foreign exchange.
•reported sg&a expenses increased 8% in fiscal 2023, driven primarily by (a) higher compensation-related expenses, (b) higher discretionary spend, and (c) costs related to the transaction, transition, and integration of the gin mare and diplomático brands, which were acquired during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, partially offset by the positive effect of foreign exchange.

note: results may differ due to rounding reported operating income was $1.1 billion in fiscal 2023, a decrease of $77 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2022. operating margin declined 3.9 percentage points to 26.7% in fiscal 2023 from 30.6% in fiscal 2022 driven by (a) unfavorable cost/mix; (b) certain post-closing costs and expenses in connection with the acquisitions of diplomático and gin mare; (c) the negative effect of foreign exchange; (d) higher investment in reported advertising expense; and (e) higher non-cash impairment charges, largely related to the finlandia brand name. this decline was partially offset by favorable price/mix and the removal of tariffs.
interest expense (net) increased $4 million, or 6%, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, due to a higher average short-term debt balance and a higher interest rate on our short-term borrowings.
our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 23.0% compared to 24.8% in fiscal 2022. the decrease in our effective tax rate was driven primarily by the reversal of valuation allowances in the current year, the beneficial impact of prior fiscal year true-ups, and increased u.s. tax benefit for foreign derived sales, which is partially offset by increased tax on foreign operations and increased state taxes. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
diluted earnings per share were $1.63 in fiscal 2023, a decrease of 7% compared to fiscal 2022, due to the decrease in reported operating income, partially offset by the benefit of a lower effective tax rate.
fiscal 2024 outlook below we discuss our outlook for fiscal 2024, which reflects the trends, developments, and uncertainties (including those described above) that we expect to affect our business. when we provide guidance for organic change in certain measures of the statements of operations we do not provide guidance for the corresponding gaap change, as the gaap measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, such as foreign exchange, which could have a significant impact to our gaap income statement measures.
we are optimistic about our prospects for growth of organic net sales and organic operating income in fiscal 2024. we believe trends will normalize after two consecutive years of double-digit organic net sales growth. accordingly, we expect the following in fiscal 2024:
•reflecting the strength of our portfolio of brands, our pricing strategy, and strong consumer demand, we expect organic net sales growth in the 5% to 7% range.
•based on the above organic net sales growth outlook, and our expectation that continued input cost pressures will be partially offset by lower supply chain disruption costs, we anticipate organic operating income growth in the 6% to 8% range.
•we expect our fiscal 2024 effective tax rate to be in the range of approximately 21% to 23%.
•capital expenditures are planned to be in the range of $250 to $270 million.
liquidity and capital resources we generate strong cash flows from operations, which enable us to meet current obligations, fund capital expenditures, and return cash to our stockholders through regular dividends and, from time to time, through share repurchases and special dividends. we believe our investment-grade credit ratings (a1 by moody's and a- by standard & poor's) provide us with financial flexibility when accessing global debt capital markets and allow us to reserve adequate debt capacity for investment opportunities and unforeseen events.
our operating cash flows are supplemented by cash and cash equivalent balances, as well as access to other liquidity sources. cash and cash equivalents were $868 million at april 30, 2022, and $374 million at april 30, 2023. as of april 30, 2023, approximately 52% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we expect to reinvest indefinitely outside of the united states. we continue to evaluate our future cash deployment and may decide to repatriate additional cash held by our foreign subsidiaries. this may require us to provide for and pay additional taxes.
we have an $800 million commercial paper program that we use, together with our cash flow from operations, to fund our short-term operational needs. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for outstanding commercial paper balances, interest rates, and days to maturity at april 30, 2022 and april 30, 2023. the average balances, interest rates, and original maturities during 2022 and 2023 are presented below.

our commercial paper program is supported by available commitments under our undrawn $800 million bank credit facility. the credit facility was scheduled to expire in november 2024. on may 26, 2023, we entered into an amended and restated five-year credit agreement with various u.s. and international banks that provides for a $900 million unsecured revolving credit commitment and expires on may 26, 2028. this agreement amended and restated our previous credit agreement. the new agreement contains no financial covenants. although unlikely, under extreme market conditions, one or more participating banks may not be able to fund its commitments under our new credit facility. to manage this counterparty credit risk, we partner with banks that have investment grade credit ratings, limit the amount of exposure we have with each bank, and monitor each bank's financial conditions.
on january 3, 2023, we entered into a $600 million senior unsecured 364-day term loan credit agreement with various u.s. and international banks. we used borrowings from the term loan to repay the $250 million principal amount of 2.25% senior unsecured notes on their maturity date of january 15, 2023, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.
on march 23, 2023, we issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal of $650 million. interest on these notes will accrue at a rate of 4.75% and be paid semi-annually. these notes will mature on april 15, 2033. we used the net proceeds from the issuance to repay $600 million of outstanding indebtedness under the unsecured 364-day term loan agreement.
our most significant short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding our operations (such as expenditures for raw materials, production and distribution, advertising and promotion, and current taxes) and capital investments. our most significant longer-term cash requirements primarily include payments related to our long-term debt, employee benefit obligations, and deferred tax liabilities (see notes 6, 9 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements).
while we expect to meet our planned short-term liquidity needs largely through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program, a sustained market deterioration resulting in declines in net sales and profit could require us to evaluate alternative sources of liquidity. if we have additional liquidity needs, we believe that we could access financing in the debt capital markets.
we believe our current liquidity position, supplemented by our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations in the future, and our ample debt capacity enabled by our strong short-term and long-term credit ratings, will be sufficient to meet all of our future financial commitments.

cash provided by operations of $640 million during fiscal 2023 declined $296 million from fiscal 2022, primarily reflecting increased working capital. the increase in working capital was primarily attributable to higher levels of inventory, which were affected by significantly higher input costs and other effects of supply chain disruptions. the decline in cash from operations also reflects $55 million of transaction costs related to our acquisitions of gin mare and diplomático, and a $52 million increase in cash paid for income taxes, primarily reflecting the timing of u.s. federal estimated tax payments.
cash used for investing activities was $1,355 million during fiscal 2023, compared to $127 million during the prior year. the $1,228 million increase largely reflects our acquisitions of gin mare ($468 million) and diplomático ($727 million) during fiscal 2023. the increase in cash used for investing activities also includes a $45 million increase in capital expenditures, largely reflecting additional spending on projects to expand the capacity of our whiskey and tequila production facilities.
cash provided by financing activities was $239 million during fiscal 2023, compared to $1,038 million in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2022. the $1,277 million change largely reflects: (a) proceeds of $648 million from the issuance of 4.75% notes in march 2023; (b) a $430 million increase in net proceeds from short-term borrowings; and (c) a $453 million decline in dividend payments (largely reflecting the $479 million special dividend paid in december 2021); partially offset by (d) our repayment of the $250 million principal amount of 2.25% notes that matured in january 2023.
a discussion of our cash flows for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 may be found in "part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," of our 2022 form 10-k.
dividends as announced in november 2022, our board of directors approved a 9% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on our class a and class b common stock from $0.1885 per share to $0.2055 per share, effective with the regular quarterly dividend paid on january 3, 2023. as a result, the indicated annual cash dividend increased from $0.7540 per share to $0.8220 per share.
as announced on may 25, 2023, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend on our class a and class b common stock of $0.2055 per share. the dividend is payable on july 3, 2023, to stockholders of record on june 8, 2023.
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements reflect some estimates involved in applying the following critical accounting policies that entail uncertainties and subjectivity. using different estimates or policies could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition.
goodwill and other intangible assets when we acquire a business, we first allocate the purchase price to identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible brand names and trademarks ("brand names"), based on estimated fair value. we then record any remaining purchase price as goodwill. we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives. we consider all of our brand names to have indefinite lives.
the gin mare and diplomático acquisitions during fiscal 2023 have been accounted for as business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. on the acquisition dates, we recognized the separately identifiable intangible assets based on the preliminary purchase price allocations. the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values assigned to the net identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses were recognized as goodwill. for additional information, see notes 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
we assess our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of the related reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, in which case we write down the goodwill by the amount of the excess (limited to the carrying amount of the goodwill). we estimate the reporting unit's fair value using discounted estimated future cash flows or market information. similarly, a brand name is impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value, in which case we write down the brand name to its estimated fair value. we estimate the fair value of a brand name using the relief-from-royalty method. we also consider market values for similar assets when available. considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value, including making assumptions about future cash flows, net sales, discount rates, and royalty rates.
we have the option, before quantifying the fair value of a reporting unit or brand name, to evaluate qualitative factors to assess whether it is more likely than not that our goodwill or brand names are impaired. if we determine that is not the case, then we are not required to quantify the fair value. that assessment also takes considerable management judgment.
based on our assumptions, we believe none of our goodwill or other intangibles are impaired as of april 30, 2023. the gin mare and diplomático brand names are recorded at their current estimated fair values, as discussed in notes 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements. the finlandia brand name's carrying amount of $91 million approximates its fair value, based on the relief-from-royalty method, using current assumptions. reasonably possible changes in those assumptions could result in future impairment of the finlandia brand name. for example, we estimate that, all else equal, (a) a 15% decline in projected future net sales would result in an impairment charge of approximately $23 million or (b) a 1 percentage point increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment charge of approximately $13 million. we estimate the fair values of goodwill and other brand names substantially exceed their carrying amounts.
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans providing retiree health care and retiree life insurance benefits. benefits are based on factors such as years of service and compensation level during employment. we expense the benefits expected to be paid over employees' expected service. this requires us to make assumptions to determine the net benefit costs and obligations, such as discount rates, return on plan assets, the rate of salary increases, expected service, and health care cost trend rates. we review these assumptions annually and modify them based on current rates and trends when appropriate. the assumptions also reflect our historical experience and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. we believe the discount rates and expected return on plan assets are the most significant assumptions.
the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations is determined at the beginning of each fiscal year using a yield curve based on the interest rates of high-quality debt securities with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of our benefit payments. the service cost and interest cost components are measured by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve. the expected return on pension plan assets reflects expected capital market returns for each asset class that are based on historical returns, adjusted for the expected effects of diversification.
the following table compares the assumed discount rates and expected return on assets used in determining net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2023 to those to be used in determining that cost for fiscal 2024.

discount rate for service cost            4.44   %                4.98   %               4.50    %                     5.02    %
discount rate for interest cost           3.97   %                4.79   %               3.96    %                     4.78    %
expected return on plan assets            6.25   %                6.50   %                     n/a                           n/a using these assumptions, we estimate our pension and other postretirement benefit cost for fiscal 2024 will be approximately $21 million, unchanged from the amount (excluding settlement charges) for fiscal 2023. decreasing/increasing the assumed discount rates by 50 basis points would increase/decrease the total fiscal 2024 cost by approximately $4 million. decreasing/increasing the assumed return on plan assets by 50 basis points would increase/decrease the total fiscal 2024 cost by approximately $3 million.
income taxes significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. we establish liabilities when some positions are likely to be challenged and may not succeed, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. we adjust these liabilities in light of changing circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. we believe current liabilities are appropriate for all known contingencies, but this situation could change.
years can elapse before we can resolve a particular matter for which we may have established a tax liability. although predicting the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter can be difficult, we believe our liabilities reflect the likely outcome of known tax contingencies. unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could require use of our cash and increase our effective tax rate. conversely, a favorable resolution could result in reduced cash tax payments, the reversal of previously established liabilities, or some combination of these results, which could reduce our effective tax rate.

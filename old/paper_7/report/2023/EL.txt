not adjusted for differences caused by rounding period-over-period changes in our net sales are generally attributable to the impacts from (i) pricing on our base portfolio, including changes in mix and those due to strategic pricing actions, (ii) volume, including changes driven by the impact of new product innovation, (iii) acquisitions and/or divestitures, and/or (iv) foreign currency translation. the percentages disclosed for these impacts are calculated on an individual basis.
the net sales impact from pricing consists of changes in list prices, due to strategic pricing actions, and mix shifts within and among product categories, geographic regions, brands and distribution channels. the prices at which we sell our products vary by brand, distribution channel (e.g., wholesale or direct-to-consumer) and may also vary by country. our brands and products cover a broad array of pricing tiers. prices of skin care and fragrance products are typically higher than makeup and hair care products.
new product innovation includes the introduction of new products, as well as changes related to existing products or where they are sold, including reformulations, regional expansion, repackaging and sets. a product is considered "new innovation" for the twelve-month period following the initial shipment date. our innovation is launched at different price points than existing products and value derived from innovation may vary from year to year. we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives. the economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period. the introduction of new products often has some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. the impact of new product introductions, including timing compared to introductions in prior periods, also affects our results.
non-gaap financial measures we use certain non-gaap financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business. management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods. while we consider the non-gaap measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap. see reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures beginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-gaap financial measures and the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures.
we operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states. accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations. therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states. constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. we calculate constant currency information by translating current-period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates and adjusting for the period-over-period impact of foreign currency cash flow hedging activities.
overview business update we are a leader in prestige beauty, which combines the repeat purchase and relative affordability of consumer goods with high quality products and services. within prestige beauty, we are diversified by product category, geography, brand, product sub-category, channel, consumer segment and price point. we also leverage consumer analytics and insights with agility by deploying our brands to fast growing and profitable opportunities. these analytics and insights, combined with our creativity, inform our innovation to provide a broad, locally-relevant and inclusive range of prestige products allowing us to compete effectively for a greater share of a consumer's beauty routine.
during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023, the operating environment continued to be disrupted by the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. most notably, the pace of recovery in asia travel retail and mainland china was slower than anticipated. in hainan, prolonged store closures initially presented a headwind and, thereafter, low levels of conversion occurred when travel resumed. this was compounded by inventory tightening by certain retailers. in korea, the travel retail business slowed during the transition to post-covid-19 regulations. in addition, the slower than anticipated resumption of international flights, granting of visas, and organized group tours further challenged the asia travel retail recovery. as a result, our asia travel retail business was challenged throughout the fiscal year by the slower than anticipated recovery. in mainland china, our performance in the first half of fiscal 2023 was hindered by low retail traffic as a result of covid-19-related restrictions and the rise in covid-19 cases.
elsewhere, the recovery from the covid-19 pandemic progressed across markets globally over the course of the fiscal year as restrictions lifted. in the west, our recovery from the pandemic continued with net sales growth in many markets in europe, the middle east & africa and in latin america. in asia/pacific, certain of our markets emerged strongly into recovery across the fiscal year, to deliver net sales growth throughout the region.
in the united states, net sales was unfavorably impacted by the slower than anticipated pace of our improvement at retail and the tightening of inventory in certain retailers in the first half of fiscal 2023 due to inflationary pressures and recession concerns.
finally, our business was also pressured by the strong u.s dollar, inflation and recession concerns globally.
during fiscal 2023, net sales decreased 10%, reflecting the impacts noted above.
‚Ä¢our skin care net sales declined 17%, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 3%, driven by declines from esteÃÅe lauder, la mer and dr.jart+, primarily reflecting the challenges in our asia travel retail business throughout the year, as previously discussed. partially offsetting these declines was growth in every geographic region from the ordinary, reflecting the success of hero products and new product launches, and from m¬∑a¬∑c, driven by the launch of the hyper real line of products.
‚Ä¢our makeup net sales decreased 3%, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 4%. net sales declines from esteÃÅe lauder, tom ford and la mer, primarily reflect the challenges in asia travel retail throughout the year and in mainland china in the first half of the fiscal year, as previously discussed, were partially offset by higher net sales from m¬∑a¬∑c, primarily driven by the recognition of the previously deferred revenue due to changes to the back-to-m¬∑a¬∑c take back program, and clinique.
‚Ä¢our fragrance net sales remained virtually flat as growth driven by esteÃÅe lauder, le labo, tom ford, clinique, and kilian paris was offset by the impact of the license terminations effective june 30, 2022 related to certain of our designer fragrances of 9% and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 4%.
‚Ä¢our hair care net sales increased 3%, driven by higher net sales from the ordinary reflecting the recent launch of hair care products by the brand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 3%.
our global distribution capability and operations allow us to focus on targeted expanded consumer reach wherever consumer demographics and trends are attractive. our regional organizations, and the expertise of our people there, enable our brands to be more locally and culturally relevant in both product assortment and communications. we are evolving the way we connect with our consumers in stores, online and where they travel, including by expanding our digital and social media presence and the engagement of global and local influencers to amplify brand or product stories. we tailor implementation of our strategy by market to drive consumer engagement and embrace inclusion and cultural diversity. we continuously strengthen our presence in large, image-building core markets, while broadening our presence in emerging markets.
‚Ä¢net sales in the americas decreased 2%, primarily driven by a decrease in the united states, reflecting the slower than anticipated pace of our improvement at retail, the tightening of inventory from certain of our retailers during the first half of fiscal 2023 and the impact of the license terminations related to certain of our designer fragrances. partially offsetting this decrease in the americas was an increase in net sales in latin america, led by brazil and mexico, driven by growth in makeup, which reflected new product launches and successful performance during key shopping moments.
‚Ä¢net sales in europe, the middle east & africa decreased 19%, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 3%, driven primarily by lower net sales from our travel retail business reflecting the challenges in our asia travel retail business as previously discussed.
‚Ä¢net sales in asia/pacific decreased 4%, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 8% and the challenges stemming from the covid-19 pandemic, led by our dr.jart+ travel retail business in korea, partially offset by the increase in net sales in hong kong sar and macau sar and southeast asia, reflecting the continued covid-19 recovery and successful brand activations and new product launches in hong kong sar and macau sar.
we approach distribution strategically by product category and location and seek to optimize distribution by matching our brands with appropriate opportunities while seeking to maintain high productivity per door. we are expanding our brands in online and travel retail, which we believe will be higher growth channels in the long term. we also focus on brand-building retail activities, technology-driven activations and omnichannel capabilities that enhance the shopping experience for consumers.
‚Ä¢as part of this strategy, we have built a leadership position in the global travel retail channel, that historically allowed us to leverage the robust and growing international passenger traffic. while the asia travel retail business continued to be pressured by the slower than anticipated recovery from the covid-19 pandemic, we realized recovery in the americas and europe, the middle east & africa and we continue to believe that global travel retail is a long-term growth opportunity. travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building, particularly for those consumers who experience our brands for the first time while traveling. we continue to expand our strategic presence in travel retail across duty-free locations primarily in airports and downtown stores and increasingly through online retail. we engage consumers at the airport through compelling pop-up activations in non-traditional commercial areas, and we ensure we have appropriate communication and curated assortments for targeted consumer groups. at the same time, travel retail is susceptible to a number of external factors, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers' willingness and ability to travel and spend.
‚Ä¢we continue to support e- and m-commerce sites of our own, collaborate with our retailers on their e-commerce sites, and sell through select third-party online malls. we believe our success in the channel is a result of adapting our strategy to meet local market and cultural needs. we also continue to develop and implement omnichannel concepts, virtual try-on tools and compelling content to deliver an integrated consumer experience and better serve consumers as they shop across channels.
in fiscal 2023, we continued to further integrate social impact and sustainability into our strategy and business operations. areas of focus include climate and energy; packaging; sourcing; green chemistry and ingredient transparency; inclusion, diversity and equity; employee health and safety; and social investments.
outlook we are experiencing a more gradual and prolonged recovery from the covid-19 pandemic, particularly in our asia travel retail business. in asia travel retail, there have been, and are likely to continue to be, impacts on our business in the near-term, from the slower than anticipated depletion of elevated levels of retailer inventory and, therefore, lower replenishment orders, as well as the slower than anticipated resumption of international flights, granting of visas, and organized group tours. additionally, in korea, the shipments to duty free retailers were pressured owing to the transition to post-covid-19 regulations as traveling consumers gradually return. in addition to impacting net sales and profitability, including any unfavorable impacts to our effective tax rate from changes to our geographical mix of earnings, these and other challenges may adversely impact the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our brands, as well as long-lived assets (i.e. potentially resulting in impairments).
we believe that the best way to increase long-term stockholder value is to continue providing superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing shifts in consumers' behaviors and shopping practices. accordingly, our long-term strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable. we plan to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity and innovation, high quality products and services, and engaging communications while investing for long-term sustainable growth.
we continue to monitor the effects of the global macro environment, including the risk of recession; currency volatility; inflationary pressures; supply chain challenges; social and political issues; regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs and sanctions; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues. for example, the strengthening of the u.s. dollar could negatively impact results within europe, the middle east & africa due to pricing pressures on our retail customers and consumers in key international travel retail locations. additionally, we continue to monitor the geopolitical tensions between the united states and china, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. we are also mindful of inflationary pressures on our cost base and are monitoring the impact on consumer preferences.
as the invasion of ukraine continues and international sanctions evolve, we have scaled down our operations in russia. we expect to continue selling a limited selection of products to retailers in russia. we will continue to monitor the risks and evolving situation that may further affect our business and will adjust our plans accordingly. in fiscal 2023, our net sales in ukraine and russia accounted for approximately 1% of consolidated net sales. there are uncertainties related to the future impacts on our business, including possible new sanctions that are difficult to predict due to the high level of geopolitical volatility. on a broader perspective, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings, assets and cash flows from such uncertainties. we also note that worsening conditions could exacerbate economic challenges in other countries such as inflationary pressures, energy shortages, recessions or other consequences. please refer to risk factors in part i, item 1a of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023, for a more complete discussion of the risks we encounter in our business and industry.
the uncertainty around the timing, speed and duration of the recovery from the adverse impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, including the impacts on our business in asia travel retail and mainland china and the other macro challenges we are facing, will continue to affect our ability to grow sales profitably. we believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of some of these challenges by continually developing and pursuing a diversified strategy with multiple engines of growth and by accelerating initiatives focused on areas of strength, discipline and agility, including continuing to execute upon and benefit from efficiencies attributable to previously approved initiatives under the post-covid business acceleration program. as the current situation continues to progress, if economic and social conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged, there could be a further negative effect on consumer confidence, demand, spending and willingness or ability to travel and, as a result, on our business. we are continuing to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business.
cybersecurity incident disclosed in july 2023
as previously disclosed on july 18, 2023, we identified a cybersecurity incident in which an unauthorized third party gained access to some of our systems. after becoming aware of the incident, we proactively took down some of our systems to help secure our business operations and subsequently brought back online core systems within days. while the response to the incident resulted in some disruptions to our business operations, most notably general corporate activities and order processing, our production and sales operations were minimally impacted.
our investigation into the systems and the unauthorized access is substantially complete. we determined that the unauthorized third party obtained some data from our systems. we are continuing to work to understand the nature and scope of the data obtained, and can confirm, based on the investigation to date, that the data obtained includes some consumer data (such as names, contact information, and dates of birth). we took steps, and continue to take steps, to enhance the security of our systems. we are also continuing to coordinate with law enforcement authorities. we have provided and will continue to provide notification to governmental authorities in certain jurisdictions and we also will notify affected individuals where required by law.
based on the information available to date, we believe the incident is contained. based on this information, the incident is not expected to have a material impact on net sales and is expected to be dilutive approximately $.07 to earnings per share for the fiscal 2024 first quarter and full year.
post-covid business acceleration program on august 20, 2020, we announced a two-year restructuring program, post-covid business acceleration program (the "pcba program"), designed to realign our business to address the dramatic shifts to our distribution landscape and consumer behaviors in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic. the pcba program was designed to help improve efficiency and effectiveness by rebalancing resources to growth areas of prestige beauty. the pcba program's main areas of focus include accelerating the shift to online with the realignment of our distribution network reflecting freestanding store and certain department store closures, with a focus on north america and europe, the middle east & africa; the reduction in brick-and-mortar point of sale employees and related support staff; and the redesign of our regional branded marketing organizations, plus select opportunities in global brands and functions. this program is expected to position us to better execute our long-term strategy and strengthen our financial flexibility. we approved specific initiatives under the pcba program through fiscal 2022 and substantially completed those initiatives through fiscal 2023. for additional information about restructuring and other charges, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 8 - charges associated with restructuring and other activities.
impairment analysis we assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
during the fiscal 2023 second quarter, given the lower-than-expected results in the overall business, we revised the internal forecasts relating to our smashbox reporting unit. we concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark intangible asset. the remaining carrying value of the trademark intangible asset was not recoverable and we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million reducing the carrying value to zero.
during the fiscal 2023 second quarter, the dr.jart+ reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions and channels that continue to be impacted by the spread of covid-19 variants, resurgence in cases, and the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of covid-19 impacting the financial performance of the reporting unit. in addition, due to macro-economic factors, dr.jart+ has experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions. the too faced reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected results in key geographic regions and channels coupled with delays in future international expansion to areas that continue to be impacted by covid-19. as a result, we revised the internal forecasts relating to our dr.jart+ and too faced reporting units. additionally, there were increases in the weighted average cost of capital for both reporting units as compared to the prior year annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of april 1, 2022.
we concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting units, along with increases in the weighted average cost of capital, triggered the need for interim impairment reviews of their trademarks and goodwill. these changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of dr.jart+'s and too faced's long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. accordingly, we performed interim impairment tests for the trademarks and a recoverability test for the long-lived assets as of november 30, 2022. we concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of $100 million for dr.jart+ and $86 million for too faced. we concluded that the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets were recoverable. after adjusting the carrying values of the trademarks, we completed interim quantitative impairment tests for goodwill. as the estimated fair value of the dr.jart+ and too faced reporting units were in excess of their carrying values, we concluded that the carrying amounts of the goodwill were recoverable and did not record a goodwill impairment charge related to these reporting units. the fair values of these reporting units were based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting units. the significant assumptions used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates for trademarks. the most significant unobservable input used to estimate the fair values of the dr.jart+ and too faced trademark intangible assets was the weighted average cost of capital, which was 11% and 13%, respectively.
a summary of the trademark impairment charges for fiscal 2023 and the remaining carrying values as of june 30, 2023, for each reporting unit, are as follows:
impairment charges                                                                                  carrying value

the impairment charges for fiscal 2023 were reflected in the skin care product category for dr.jart+ and the makeup product category for smashbox and too faced.
based on our annual goodwill impairment testing as of april 1, 2023, the fair values of all reporting units, which were determined based on qualitative or quantitative assessments, with material goodwill were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values.
based on our annual other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of april 1, 2023, the estimated fair value of the dr.jart+ and too faced trademarks exceeded their carrying values by 12% and 14%, respectively. for the dr.jart+ and too faced trademarks, if all other assumptions are held constant, a decrease of 10% in the estimated future cash flows, inclusive of the terminal value, or an increase of 75 basis points for dr.jart+ and 100 basis points for too faced in the weighted average cost of capital, would have caused the carrying value of these trademarks to approximate their fair value. the key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units and their respective trademarks are primarily predicated on the anticipated recovery from the impacts of covid-19, the success of future new product launches, ability to secure strategic price increases, the achievement of distribution expansion plans, and the realization of cost reduction and other efficiency efforts. if such plans do not materialize, or if there are further challenges in the business environments in which the reporting unit operates, resulting changes in the key assumptions could have negative impacts on the estimated fair value of the reporting units, and their respective trademarks, and it is possible we could recognize additional impairment charges in the future.

reported net sales decreased in fiscal 2023, driven by lower net sales from the skin care and makeup product categories, slightly offset by higher net sales in the hair care product category. fragrance net sales were virtually flat.
reported net sales decreased in fiscal 2023, reflecting lower net sales from all geographic regions.
during fiscal 2023, our business was challenged by the slower than anticipated recovery from the covid-19 pandemic, including restrictions in mainland china and the rising number of covid-19 cases earlier in the fiscal year. this impacted our business in asia travel retail, including the tightening of inventory by certain of our retailers, as well as the low levels of conversion when travel resumed. this resulted in lower product shipments, compounded by the impact of retailers continuing to reduce inventory. in mainland china, the aforementioned restrictions earlier in the fiscal year negatively impacted our business, however, lower covid-19 related restrictions in the second half of fiscal 2023, as compared to the second half of fiscal 2022, resulted in increased net sales in the second half of fiscal 2023.
the fiscal 2023 reported net sales decrease was impacted by approximately $629 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.
reported net sales decreased 10% in fiscal 2023, driven by the decrease from volume of 7%, the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 4% and the net impact from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures of 1%. partially offsetting these decreases was an increase from pricing of 1%, due to the favorable impact from strategic pricing actions, partially offset by changes in mix.
returns associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures. accordingly, the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic regions exclude the fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 impacts of returns associated with restructuring and other activities of approximately $27 million and $4 million, respectively.

reported skin care net sales decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily driven by lower net sales from esteÃÅe lauder, la mer, dr.jart+, clinique and origins, combined, of approximately $1,830 million, that were mostly attributable to the aforementioned challenges in asia travel retail.
partially offsetting these decreases in skin care net sales in fiscal 2023 were higher net sales from the ordinary and m¬∑a¬∑c, combined, of approximately $133 million. the increase in net sales from the ordinary was driven by growth in every geographic region, reflecting success of hero products and new product launches. the increase in net sales from m¬∑a¬∑c was primarily driven by the fiscal 2023 launch of the hyper real line of products.
the skin care net sales decrease was impacted by approximately $337 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.
reported skin care net sales decreased 17% in fiscal 2023, driven by the decrease from volume of 13% and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 3%. the impact from pricing was flat period-over-period, due to the favorable impact from strategic pricing actions offset by changes in mix.

the decrease in gross margin in fiscal 2023 reflected unfavorable impacts from changes in our mix of business, higher manufacturing costs and other, and higher obsolescence charges. the unfavorable impact from our mix of business is primarily driven by category mix, driven by the decrease in skin care net sales which typically have higher margins than other product categories, as well as higher costs associated with promotional items. manufacturing costs and other increased, driven by higher expenses within our inventory deferrals recognized during the current year reflecting lower production volume due to lower demand and higher costs for freight and material commodities. the unfavorable impact from obsolescence charges is primarily due to excess inventory on hand and increased levels of inventory destruction and reserves driven by lower demand that resulted in lower product shipments.

reported skin care operating income decreased in fiscal 2023 reflecting lower operating results from esteÃÅe lauder, la mer, clinique and origins, combined, of approximately $1,556 million, primarily driven by decreases in net sales, partially offset by disciplined advertising and promotional expense management, as well as an unfavorable year-over-year impact for the change in fair value of acquisition-related stock options of $75 million relating to the fiscal 2021 increase in our investment in deciem. also contributing to the decrease in skin care operating income from esteÃÅe lauder, la mer and clinique was a higher cost of sales. the increase in cost of sales from esteÃÅe lauder was due in part to higher manufacturing costs and obsolescence charges. the increase in cost of sales from la mer was due in part to higher manufacturing costs and the increase in cost of sales from clinique was due in part to higher costs for promotional items. the decrease in operating income from origins was also partially offset by a lower cost of sales due to the net sales decrease and lower selling expenses due to the closure of freestanding stores during fiscal 2023.

reported makeup operating income decreased in fiscal 2023, reflecting lower results from esteÃÅe lauder, tom ford and la mer, combined, of approximately $191 million, primarily driven by a decrease in net sales, as well as the fiscal 2023 second quarter other intangible asset impairments related to too faced and smashbox of $107 million, combined. the decrease in operating income from tom ford also reflected a higher cost of sales, due in part to higher manufacturing costs and higher obsolescence charges. also contributing to the decrease in operating income from la mer was higher advertising and promotional activities, partially offset by a lower cost of sales due to lower net sales compared to the prior year. partially offsetting the decrease in operating income from esteÃÅe lauder was disciplined advertising and promotional expense management.
partially offsetting the decrease in makeup operating income in fiscal 2023 were higher results from m¬∑a¬∑c, primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred revenue due to changes to the back-to-m¬∑a¬∑c take back program and lower store operating costs, partially offset by an increase in cost of sales, as well as lower employee incentive compensation compared to the prior year.

interest expense increased in fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting a higher debt balance, due in part to the financing of our acquisition of the tom ford brand, including the issuance of commercial paper primarily in the second half of fiscal 2023, and the issuance of senior notes in may 2023 and higher interest rates compared to the prior year. interest income and investment income, net increased, primarily reflecting higher interest rates compared to the prior year.
other income, net on may 18, 2021, we acquired additional shares in deciem, a toronto-based skin care company, for $1,092 million in cash, including proceeds from the issuance of debt. deciem is a multi-brand beauty company with a brand portfolio that includes the ordinary and niod. we originally acquired a minority interest in deciem in june 2017. the minority interest was accounted for as an equity method investment, which had a carrying value of $65 million at the acquisition date. the acquisition of additional shares increased our fully diluted equity interest from approximately 29% to approximately 76% and was considered a step acquisition. on a fully diluted basis, the deciem stock options approximated 4% of the total capital structure. accordingly, for purposes of determining the consideration transferred, we excluded the deciem stock options, which resulted in an increase in our post-acquisition undiluted equity interest from approximately 30% to approximately 78% and the post-acquisition undiluted equity interest of the remaining noncontrolling interest holders of approximately 22%. we remeasured the previously held equity method investment to its fair value of $913 million, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $848 million. the gain on our previously held equity method investment is included in other income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended june 30, 2021. as part of the increase in our investment, we were granted the right to purchase ("call option"), and granted the remaining investors a right to sell to us ("put option"), the remaining interests after a three-year period, with a purchase price based on the future performance of deciem (the "net put (call) option"). as a result of this redemption feature, we recorded redeemable noncontrolling interest, at its acquisition‚Äêdate fair value, that is classified as mezzanine equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at june 30, 2021. the accounting for the deciem business combination was finalized during the fiscal 2022 third quarter.

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents u.s. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the tax impact of share-based compensation, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations. our effective tax rate will change from year-to-year based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the tax impact of share-based compensation, the interaction of various global tax strategies and the impact from certain acquisitions.

reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures we use certain non-gaap financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business. management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period, or do not reflect the company's underlying ongoing business, provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze our operating performance from period to period. in the future, we expect to incur charges or adjustments similar in nature to those presented below; however, the impact to the company's results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict. our non-gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by, or determined in a manner consistent with, other companies. while we consider the non-gaap measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap. the following tables present net sales, operating income and diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities; other intangible asset impairments; the change in fair value of acquisition-related stock options; and the effects of foreign currency translation. the following tables provide reconciliations between these non-gaap financial measures and the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures.

financial condition liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad. at june 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4,029 million compared with $3,957 million at june 30, 2022. our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions. to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength, and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we temporarily reduced our holdings of bank deposits and increased our allocation of government money market funds, due to stresses in the global banking system.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support seasonal working capital needs, currently planned business operations, information technology enhancements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, restructuring initiatives, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis.
the tcja resulted in the transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changed the tax law in ways that present opportunities to repatriate cash without additional u.s. federal income tax. as a result, we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign earnings. as explained in further detail in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 9 - income taxes, during the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, we changed our assertion regarding our ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. we continue to analyze the indefinite reinvestment assertion on our remaining applicable foreign earnings. we do not believe that continuing to reinvest these remaining applicable foreign earnings impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations. if these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends, we would be subject to state income taxes and applicable foreign taxes in certain jurisdictions.
inflation impacted our operating results during fiscal 2023 and we expect it to continue. generally, we have plans to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies which we expect to offset some of these cost increases.
credit ratings changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs. our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility. downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing. a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. as of august 11, 2023, our long-term debt is rated a+ with a negative outlook by standard & poor's and a1 with a stable outlook by moody's.
debt and access to liquidity total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) increased to 59% at june 30, 2023 from 49% at june 30, 2022, primarily due to the increase in total debt, reflecting the financing of our acquisition of the tom ford brand, including the issuance of commercial paper primarily in the second half of fiscal 2023, and the issuance of senior notes in may 2023.

the change in net cash flows provided by operating activities primarily reflected lower earnings before tax, excluding non-cash items, partially offset by the favorable change in working capital, reflecting a favorable change in inventory and promotional merchandise and accounts receivable, partially offset by lower accounts payable due to timing of payments and lower other accrued and noncurrent liabilities, which includes the settlement of net investment hedges.
the change in net cash flows used for investing activities was primarily driven by cash paid in connection with the acquisition of the tom ford brand during the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter and also reflects a favorable impact from the settlement of net investment hedges, which is offset by the unfavorable change in other accrued liabilities as discussed above.
the change in net cash flows provided by (used for) financing activities primarily reflected lower treasury stock purchases compared to the prior year, an increase in debt due to the issuance of senior notes in may 2023 and the issuance of commercial paper in the second half of fiscal 2023, due in part to finance our acquisition of the tom ford brand, partially offset by an increase in repayments of long-term debt.

pension and post-retirement plan funding several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans. for our domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan ("u.s. qualified plan"), we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages. for any future contributions to the u.s. qualified plan, we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, ("erisa") and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. for each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations. in addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions. the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.
for the u.s. qualified plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities. this strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio. for fiscal 2023 and 2022, we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under erisa regulations for the u.s. qualified plan. we expect to make a $50 million discretionary contribution to the u.s. qualified plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. as we continue to monitor the funded status, we may decide to make additional cash contributions to the u.s. qualified plan or our post-retirement medical plan in the united states during fiscal 2024.

market risk we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. to perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts, we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. a hypothetical 10% weakening of the u.s. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately $265 million and $259 million as of june 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. this potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures.
we also enter into cross-currency swap contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency changes on certain intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. a hypothetical 10% weakening of the u.s. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our cross-currency swap contracts would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $49 million as of june 30, 2023.
in addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio, including future debt issuances. based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by approximately $55 million and $41 million as of june 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur. it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year. we believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.
recently issued accounting standards refer to item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 2 - summary of significant accounting policies for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective, on our consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30, 2023 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30, 2023 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap"). the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. we consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company's financial condition. our critical accounting policies relate to goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets - impairment assessment, income taxes, and asset acquisition.
management of the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company's board of directors.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets - impairment assessment goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets. other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks. goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
when testing goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. if necessary, we can perform a single step quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
for fiscal 2023, we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for the goodwill in certain of our reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of its reporting units were below carrying value. we considered macroeconomic factors including the global economic growth, general macroeconomic trends for the markets in which the reporting units operate and the intangible assets are employed, and the growth of the global prestige beauty industry. in addition to these macroeconomic factors, among other things, we considered the reporting units' current results and forecasts, any changes in the nature of the business, any significant legal, regulatory, contractual, political or other business climate factors, changes in the industry/competitive environment, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets and its intention to sell or dispose of a reporting unit or cease the use of a trademark.
for fiscal 2023, a quantitative assessment was performed for the goodwill in certain of our reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. we engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management. to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units, we used an equal weighting of the income and market approaches. under the income approach, we determined fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflected the relative risk of the cash flows. under the market approach, we utilized market multiples from publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. the significant assumptions used in these two approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal value, the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples. to determine the estimated fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we used an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. this method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. the significant assumptions used in this approach include revenue growth rates, terminal value, the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rate.
for fiscal 2022, we elected to perform the quantitative assessment for the goodwill in each of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. we engaged a third-party valuation specialist and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management. to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units, we used an equal weighting of the income and market approaches. under the income approach, we determined fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflected the relative risk of the cash flows. under the market approach, we utilized market multiples from publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. the significant assumptions used in these two approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal value, the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples. to determine the estimated fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we used an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. this method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. the significant assumptions used in this approach include revenue growth rates, terminal value, the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rate.

income taxes we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. as the application of various tax laws relevant to our global business is often uncertain, significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, net operating losses, tax credit and other carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. we regularly review deferred tax assets for realizability and establish valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and appropriate tax planning strategies. if our assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time, while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.
we provide tax reserves for u.s. federal, state, local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit. the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. for those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. we classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes. although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures. if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings.

asset acquisition we recognize assets acquired in an asset acquisition based on the cost to the company on a relative fair value basis, which includes transaction costs in addition to consideration transferred and liabilities assumed or issued as part of the transaction. neither goodwill nor bargain purchase gains are recognized in an asset acquisition; any excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired, or the opposite, is allocated to qualifying assets based on their relative fair values. the determination of fair value, as well as the expected useful lives of certain assets acquired, requires management to make judgments and may involve the use of significant estimates, including assumptions with respect to estimated future cash flows and discount rates, among other things. management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.
during fiscal 2023, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in 001 del llc ("001") in exchange for $2,550 million in consideration (the "tom ford acquisition"). the tom ford acquisition has been accounted for as an asset acquisition as the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in the value of the tom ford trademark intangible asset. the acquisition of 001 included existing license relationships for certain uses of the brand name, which were modified, terminated or otherwise renegotiated in connection with the transaction.
the total cost of the asset acquisition is $2,578 million and was allocated to the tom ford trademark. we engaged a third-party valuation specialist and used an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method, to determine the fair value of the tom ford trademark. this method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value were revenue growth rates, terminal value, beauty royalty savings, the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates.

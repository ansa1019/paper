item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this md&a is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, financial condition and prospects. this discussion and analysis compares 2023 results to 2022. for a discussion that compares our 2022 results to 2021, see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii, item 7 of our 2022 annual report on form 10-k. the reference to "n.m." indicates that the calculation is not meaningful. in addition, we provide commentary regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, product mix and net selling prices on net sales. changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and exited businesses also impact the year-over-year change in net sales. revenue growth management is used to describe our capability that helps optimize our consumer value proposition and thereby maximize our brands' revenue potential with consumer-centric insights. it focuses on strategic pricing decisions, price pack architecture, managing our product mix, trade promotion activity and trading terms. dollar amounts are reported in millions, except per share dollar amounts, unless otherwise noted.
the following will be discussed and analyzed:
•overview of business
•overview of 2023 results
•business environment and trends
•results of operations and related information
•liquidity and capital resources
•critical accounting policies and use of estimates
•new accounting standards
•information concerning forward-looking statements throughout this md&a, we refer to financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s., or gaap, and are therefore referred to as non-gaap financial measures. these measures include adjusted gross and operating profit, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted other (income) and expense, net, and adjusted effective tax rate. we believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the financial measures used to evaluate management.
non-gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable gaap measures, and they should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap.  there are limitations to these non-gaap financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items being excluded.  we compensate for these limitations by using these non-gaap financial measures as a supplement to the gaap measures and by providing reconciliations of the non-gaap and comparable gaap financial measures.
the non-gaap financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the reconciliations included later in this md&a:
•sale of brazil tissue and k-c professional business - in 2023, we recognized a net benefit related to the sale of our brazil tissue and k-c professional business. see item 8, note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
•impairment of intangible assets - in 2023, we recognized charges related to the impairment of certain intangible assets related to softex indonesia and thinx. see item 8, note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
•pension settlements - in 2023 and 2022, pension settlement charges were recognized related to lump-sum distributions from pension plan assets exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs resulting in a recognition of deferred actuarial losses.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2023 annual report
•acquisition of controlling interest in thinx - in the first quarter of 2022, we increased our investment in thinx. as a result of this transaction, a net benefit was recognized, primarily due to the non-recurring, non-cash gain recognized related to the remeasurement of the carrying value of our previously held equity investment to fair value, partially offset by transaction and integration costs. see item 8, note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
overview of business we are a global company focused on delivering products and solutions that provide better care for a better world, with manufacturing facilities in 33 countries, including our equity affiliates, and products sold in more than 175 countries and territories. our products are sold under well-known brands such as kleenex, scott, huggies, pull-ups, kotex and depend. we have three reportable business segments: personal care, consumer tissue and k-c professional. these business segments are described in greater detail in item 8, note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
in operating our business, we seek to:
•grow our portfolio of brands through innovation, category development and commercial execution,
•leverage our cost and financial discipline to fund growth and improve margins, and
•allocate capital in value-creating ways.
we describe our business outside north america in two groups - developing and emerging markets ("d&e") and developed markets. d&e markets comprise eastern europe, the middle east and africa, latin america and asia-pacific, excluding australia and south korea. developed markets consist of western and central europe, australia and south korea.
on february 24, 2022, we completed our acquisition of a majority and controlling share of thinx, an industry leader in the reusable period and incontinence underwear category, for total consideration of $181 consisting of cash of $53, the fair value of our previously held equity investment of $127, and certain share-based award costs of $1. in the first quarter of 2023, we delivered a redemption notice to the third-party minority owner with respect to a portion of the remaining common securities of thinx. this redemption closed in the second quarter of 2023, and we acquired additional ownership of thinx for $48, increasing our ownership in thinx to 70 percent. as part of the completion of a negotiated final redemption, we acquired the remaining 30 percent ownership of thinx for $47 in the fourth quarter of 2023. as the purchase of additional ownership in an already controlled subsidiary represents an equity transaction, no gain or loss was recognized in consolidated net income or comprehensive income. see item 8, note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
on june 1, 2023, we completed the sale transaction, announced on october 24, 2022, of our neve tissue brand and related consumer and k-c professional tissue assets in brazil for $212, including the base purchase price of $175 and working capital and other closing adjustments of $37. this transaction also included a licensing agreement to allow the acquirer to manufacture and market in brazil the kleenex, scott and wypall brands to consumers and away-from-home customers for a period of time. the assets included in the sale agreement were reclassified to other current assets as of december 31, 2022, and upon closure of the transaction, a gain of $74 pre-tax was recognized in other (income) and expense, net. we incurred divestiture-related costs of $30 pre-tax, which were recorded in cost of products sold and marketing, research and general expenses, resulting in a net benefit of $44 pre-tax ($26 after tax).

•we continue to focus on generating cash flow and allocating capital to shareholders. cash provided by operations was $3.5 billion in 2023. we raised our dividend in 2023 by 2 percent, the 51st consecutive annual increase in our dividend. altogether, share repurchases and dividends in 2023 amounted to $1.8 billion.
in 2024, we plan to continue to execute our strategies for long-term success which include delivering balanced, sustainable growth by growing our brands in-line with or ahead of category growth, leveraging our cost and financial discipline to fund growth and improve margins, and allocating capital in value-creating ways. our growth strategy is built on two pillars. elevate our core business is our first pillar and is driven by delivering value-added innovations and driving category opportunities. expanding our markets is our second pillar and emphasizes personal care.  both strategies are enabled by our focus on accelerating and investing in our commercial capabilities through digital marketing, revenue growth management, consumer-inspired innovation and strong in-market execution.
our strong legacy of financial discipline supports our growth strategy by driving ongoing supply chain productivity through our force (focused on reducing costs everywhere) program, controlling discretionary spending, driving down working capital and maintaining the top-tier return on invested capital. our capital allocation strategy is consistent with our historical approach of disciplined capital spending, payment of a top tier dividend, evaluation of acquisition opportunities and allocation of excess cash flow to share repurchases.
we are subject to risks and uncertainties, which can affect our business operations and financial results. see item 1a, "risk factors" in this form 10-k for additional information.
business environment and trends our results of operations have been, and we expect them to continue to be, affected by the following factors and key trends, which may cause our future results of operations to differ from our historical results discussed under "results of operations and related information."
covid-19 - the macro business environment has experienced unprecedented volatility in recent years reflecting the effects of the global covid-19 pandemic on supply and demand dynamics. we have seen stabilization in demand across all of our business segments during 2022 and 2023, and we expect this trend to continue.
the pandemic significantly disrupted supply chains across the globe, primarily due to the very significant fluctuations in demand and related transportation and labor supply issues. resulting supply shortages led to record levels of inflation in commodities and other costs. during 2023, inflation slowed, but costs remain elevated across many categories of our raw materials, labor, energy and other input costs, as well as transportation costs, and we expect that these elevated levels could persist in 2024, although at a decreasing rate of inflation compared to the prior fiscal year.
additionally, consumer purchasing power has generally been impacted negatively by the inflation driven by the effects of the pandemic which can impact consumer purchasing patterns.
birth rate trends - sales of our baby and child care products are highly correlated with birth rate trends. in recent years, birth rate declines in key countries, including china, south korea and the u.s., have pressured category volume growth rates. to help mitigate the effects of birth rate declines, we aim to drive sales growth at or ahead of category growth rates through innovation, premiumization, strong brand building plans and digital marketing investment as part of our elevate and expand growth strategy.
competition - our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace. our competitors include global, regional and local manufacturers, including private label manufacturers which offer products that are typically sold at lower prices. in particular, private label market share has been increasing in the tissue category. increased purchases of private label products could reduce net sales of our higher-margin products which would negatively impact our profitability. while the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and e-tailers. this market environment has resulted in increased pressure on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue in the coming year.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2023 annual report pricing - our net sales growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address market conditions. we adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand, the competitive environment, technological improvements, product innovations and changes in our raw material, distribution, energy and other input costs. in 2022 and early 2023, certain price increases were in response to continuing inflation related to the ongoing impacts of the covid-19 pandemic and other market conditions, including the war in ukraine. in 2024, we anticipate that challenging market conditions, including those related to inflation and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, may continue to impact pricing. price changes may affect net sales, earnings and market share in the near term as the market adjusts to new pricing and other market conditions.
operating costs - our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, general business taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. we manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, and pricing actions. to remain competitive on our operating structure, we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability. while some costs moderated in 2023, they still remained elevated and our results were impacted by increased costs, particularly for pulp, resin, distribution, labor and energy, primarily related to covid-19 pandemic driven effects and the effect of the war in ukraine. in 2024, we expect that increased costs will continue to affect us, although at a decreasing rate of inflation compared to the prior fiscal year.
evolving consumer product and shopping preferences - the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve due to the rapid growth of e-commerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. changing consumer preferences also include increased concerns in regard to post-consumer waste and packaging materials and their impact on environmental sustainability. if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products, our earnings could decrease. we believe our strategic growth focus, sustainability initiatives, innovation pipeline and continued investment in e-commerce capabilities has us well positioned relative to these changing dynamics.
volatility of global markets - our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations, including in d&e markets. some d&e markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions. volatility in these markets affects our production costs and the demand for our products and may impact our supply chain and distribution networks. volatility in global consumer demand, commodity costs and foreign currency exchange rates increased significantly over the past few years and is expected to continue in the near term.
climate change - we operate in many regions around the world where our businesses could be disrupted by climate change. our climate change risk categories include risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy ("transition risks") and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change ("physical risks"). transition risks include increased costs of carbon emission, increased cost to produce products in compliance with future regulations, increased raw materials cost, shifts in customer/consumer values and other legal, regulatory and technological risks. physical risks include the risk of direct damage to assets or supply chain disruption caused by severe weather events such as floods, storms, wildfires and droughts. we continue to progress toward our 2030 sustainability goals which include elements that aim for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, use of natural forest fibers, use of plastics and use of water in water-stressed regions.
war in ukraine - beginning in march 2022, we have implemented significant adjustments to our business in russia. we have substantially curtailed media, advertising and promotional activity and suspended capital investments in our sole manufacturing facility in russia. consistent with the humanitarian nature of our products, we manufacture and sell only essential items in russia, such as baby diapers and feminine pads, which are critical to the health and hygiene of women, girls and babies. our russia business has represented approximately 1 to 2 percent of our net global sales, operating profit and total assets. our ability to continue our operations in russia may change as the situation evolves. our business in russia is experiencing increased input costs, supply chain complexities, reduced consumer demand, restricted access to raw materials and production assets, and restricted access to financial institutions, as well as increased supply chain, professional services, monetary, currency, trade and payment/investment sanctions and related controls. we are actively monitoring the situation, and as the business, geopolitical and regulatory environment concerning russia evolves, we may not be able to sustain the limited manufacture and sale of our products, and our assets may be partially or fully impaired. we are also monitoring the increased risk of cyber-based attacks as a result of the war in ukraine and have implemented additional cybersecurity measures designed to address the evolving threat landscape.

kimberly-clark corporation - 2023 annual report net sales of $3.4 billion increased 5 percent compared to the year ago period, while organic sales increased 7 percent driven by changes in net selling prices and product mix of 10 percent and 1 percent, respectively, partially offset by lower volumes of 5 percent. the decrease in volumes primarily reflected expected elasticity from pricing actions. exited business decreased sales by 1 percent, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased sales by 1 percent.
operating profit of $665 increased 46 percent. results benefited from higher net selling prices, cost savings and lower input costs, partially offset by lower volumes, higher other manufacturing costs, higher marketing research and general expenses and unfavorable foreign currency effects.
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations cash provided by operations was $3,542 in 2023 compared to $2,733 in 2022. the increase was driven by the increase in operating profit, excluding the effect of non-cash charges, and improvements in working capital.
obligations the following table presents our total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable.

the unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily superabsorbent materials, pulp and utilities. although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, we believe exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.
the open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts for goods and services we have negotiated for delivery.
the table does not include amounts where payments are discretionary or the timing is uncertain. the following payments are not included in the table:
•we will fund our defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expect to contribute approximately $20 to these plans in 2024.
•other postretirement benefit payments are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations. based upon those projections, we anticipate making annual payments for these obligations of approximately $50 through 2033.
•accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, deferred taxes and noncontrolling interests.
investing our capital spending was $766 in 2023 and $876 in 2022. proceeds from asset and business dispositions of $245 primarily reflected the sale of our brazil tissue and k-c professional business. acquisition of business, net of cash acquired of $46 in 2022 reflected the acquisition of a controlling interest of thinx. we expect capital spending to be approximately $900 in 2024.
financing we issue long-term debt in the public market periodically. proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of maturing debt or outstanding commercial paper indebtedness. see item 8, note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2023 annual report our short-term debt, which consists of u.s. commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days and/or other similar short-term debt issued by non-u.s. subsidiaries, was $2 as of december 31, 2023 (included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet). the average month-end balance of short-term debt for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023 was $139. these short-term borrowings provide supplemental funding to support our operations. the level of short-term debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions, dividends and income taxes.
at december 31, 2023, total debt was $8.0 billion compared to $8.4 billion at december 31, 2022.
in 2023, cash paid for redemption of common securities of thinx of $95 was to acquire the remaining ownership of thinx. see item 8, note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
we maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in june 2028 and a $750 revolving credit facility which expires in may 2024.  these facilities, currently unused, support our commercial paper program, and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason.
in october 2021, members of the organization for economic co-operation and development/g20 inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting project ("inclusive framework") agreed to a two-pillar solution to reform the international tax framework to realign international taxation with economic activities and value creation. inclusive framework members agreed to a coordinated system of global anti-base erosion rules, referred to as pillar 2, that are designed to ensure large multinational enterprises pay a minimum 15 percent level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction in which they operate. many countries have formally implemented pillar 2, and several other countries have draft legislation to implement this framework. we do not expect pillar 2 current and proposed legislation to materially impact our effective tax rate or cash flows. we will continue to monitor and evaluate new legislation and guidance, which could change our current assessment.
the united kingdom's financial conduct authority, which regulated the london interbank offered rate ("libor"), has completed its phase out of libor as of june 30, 2023. the effect of the elimination of libor was not material.
we paid $1.6 billion in dividends in 2023. the board of directors approved a dividend increase of 3.4 percent for 2024. we repurchase shares of kimberly-clark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. during 2023, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $225 through a broker in the open market.
we believe that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, pension contributions, dividends and other needs for the foreseeable future. further, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the u.s. to have a material effect on our overall business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2023 annual report critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances, pension and other postretirement benefits, deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments, and goodwill and other intangible assets. these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors.
sales incentives and trade promotion allowances trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products. rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales. promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs. generally, the estimated redemption value of consumer coupons and related expense are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories, and the cost is recorded when the related revenue from customers is realized. our related accounting policies are discussed in item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
employee postretirement benefits substantially all regular employees in the u.s. and the united kingdom are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and certain u.s. and united kingdom employees previously earned benefits covered by defined benefit pension plans that currently provide no future service benefit (the "principal plans"). certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in item 8, note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
changes in certain assumptions could affect pension expense and the benefit obligations, particularly the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the obligations:
•long-term rate of return on plan assets. the expected long-term rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis. in setting these assumptions, we consider a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class relative to the target asset allocation. actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and they are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate.
as of december 31, 2023, the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately $1.0 billion. these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, and whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the "corridor" as required. if the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 0.25 percent, the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2024.
•discount rate. the discount (or settlement) rate used to determine the present value of our future u.s. pension obligation at december 31, 2023 was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan. for the united kingdom plan, the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities. each year's expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations. if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the increase in annual pension expense would not be material in 2024, and the december 31, 2023 pension liability would increase by about $60.
•other assumptions. there are a number of other assumptions involved in the calculation of pension expense and benefit obligations, primarily related to participant demographics and benefit elections.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2023 annual report pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate $50 in 2024. pension expense beyond 2024 will depend on future investment performance, our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered participants in the plans.
substantially all u.s. retirees and employees have access to our unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans. changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations, particularly the discount rate used to calculate the obligations and the health care cost trend rate:
•discount rate. the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above, and the methodology for each country is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate for that country's pension obligation. if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the impact to 2024 other postretirement benefit expense and the increase in the december 31, 2023 benefit liability would not be material.
•health care cost trend rate. the health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace, as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace.
deferred income taxes and potential assessments as a global organization, we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results, particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the u.s. and uncertain tax positions. our income tax related accounting policies, account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in item 8, note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
•deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. we have recorded deferred tax assets related to, among other matters, income tax loss carryforwards, income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards and have established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets. these carryforwards are primarily in non-u.s. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the u.s. foreign tax credits earned in the u.s. in current and prior years, which cannot be used currently, also give rise to net deferred tax assets. in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, many factors are considered, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
•undistributed earnings. as of december 31, 2023, we have accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries of approximately $7.2 billion. earnings of $3.3 billion were previously subject to u.s. federal income tax. any additional taxes due with respect to such previously-taxed foreign earnings, if repatriated, would generally be limited to foreign and u.s. state income taxes. deferred taxes have been recorded on $0.8 billion of earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries expected to be repatriated. we do not intend to distribute the remaining $2.5 billion of previously-taxed foreign earnings and therefore have not recorded deferred taxes for foreign and u.s. state income taxes on such earnings. we consider any excess of the amount for financial reporting over tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. the determination of deferred tax liabilities on the amount of financial reporting over tax basis or the $2.5 billion of previously-taxed foreign earnings is not practicable.
•uncertain tax positions. we record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate. where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in our income tax returns. where treatment of a position is uncertain, a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. intangible assets that are deemed to kimberly-clark corporation - 2023 annual report have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 20 years. we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists to measure the acquisition date fair values of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired.
events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares, increased competition or loss of market share, obsolescence, product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life, deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results.
our related accounting policies, acquisition of thinx and goodwill and other intangible assets account balances and other intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in item 8, notes 1, 3 and 4, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill in our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors such as macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environments, historical and projected financial performance, significant changes in the reporting unit and the magnitude of excess fair value over carrying amount from the previous quantitative impairment testing. if the result of a qualitative test indicates a potential for impairment, a quantitative test is performed. when a quantitative test is considered necessary, estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model and a market-based approach. we use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and earnings. the other key estimates and factors used in the discounted cash flow include, but are not limited to, discount rates, actual business trends experienced, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, inflation and terminal growth rates.
for 2023, we completed the required annual assessment of goodwill for impairment for all of our reporting units using a qualitative assessment as of the first day of the third quarter, and we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill significantly exceeds the carrying amount for each of our reporting units.
other intangible assets we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, primarily brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.
our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model and a market-based approach using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. the cash flows used in the discounted cash flow model are consistent with those we use in our internal planning, which gives consideration to actual business trends experienced and the long-term business strategy.
we performed our 2023 impairment assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the third quarter, subsequent to the impairments recognized in the second quarter of 2023, and based upon a qualitative assessment, no additional impairment indicators were found to be present. see item 8, note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
new accounting standards see item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting standards and their anticipated effects on our consolidated financial statements.
forward looking statements certain matters contained in this report concerning the business outlook, including raw material, energy and other input costs, the anticipated cost savings from our force program, cash flow and uses of cash, growth initiatives, innovations, marketing and other spending, net sales, anticipated currency rates and exchange risks, including the impact in argentina and türkiye, effective tax rate, contingencies and anticipated transactions of kimberly-clark, including dividends, share repurchases and pension contributions, constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are based upon management's expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting kimberly-clark.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2023 annual report there can be no assurance that these future events will occur as anticipated or that our results will be as estimated.  forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them.
the assumptions used as a basis for the forward-looking statements include many estimates that, among other things, depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases. in addition, many factors outside our control, including the war in ukraine (including the related responses of consumers, customers, and suppliers and sanctions issued by the u.s., the european union, russia or other countries), pandemics, epidemics, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the prices and availability of our raw materials, supply chain disruptions, disruptions in the capital and credit markets, counterparty defaults (including customers, suppliers and financial institutions with which we do business), failure to realize the expected benefits or synergies from our acquisition and disposition activity, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and our projections of operating results and other factors that may affect our impairment testing, changes in customer preferences, severe weather conditions, regional instabilities and hostilities (including the war in israel), government trade or similar regulatory actions, potential competitive pressures on selling prices for our products, energy costs, general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business, as well as our ability to maintain key customer relationships, could affect the realization of these estimates.
the factors described under item 1a, "risk factors" in our form 10-k, or in our other sec filings, among others, could cause our future results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results.

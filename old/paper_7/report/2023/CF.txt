•recent accounting pronouncements overview of cf holdings our company our mission is to provide clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably. with our employees focused on safe and reliable operations, environmental stewardship, and disciplined capital and corporate management, we are on a path to decarbonize our ammonia production network - the world's largest - to enable green and low-carbon hydrogen and nitrogen products for energy, fertilizer, emissions abatement, and other industrial activities. our nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the united states, canada and the united kingdom, an extensive storage, transportation and distribution network in north america, and logistics capabilities enabling a global reach underpin our strategy to leverage our unique capabilities to accelerate the world's transition to clean energy. our principal customers are cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, traders, wholesalers and industrial users. our core product is anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which contains 82% nitrogen and 18% hydrogen. our nitrogen products that are upgraded from ammonia are granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solution (uan) and ammonium nitrate (an). our other nitrogen products include diesel exhaust fluid (def), urea liquor, nitric acid and aqua ammonia, which are sold primarily to our industrial customers.
our principal assets as of december 31, 2023 include:
•six u.s. nitrogen manufacturing facilities, located in donaldsonville, louisiana (the largest nitrogen complex in the world); sergeant bluff, iowa (our port neal complex); yazoo city, mississippi; claremore, oklahoma (our verdigris complex); woodward, oklahoma; and waggaman, louisiana. the waggaman facility is wholly owned by us, and the other five u.s. nitrogen manufacturing facilities are wholly owned directly or indirectly by cf industries nitrogen, llc (cfn), of which we own approximately 89% and chs inc. (chs) owns the remainder (see note 19-noncontrolling interest for additional information on our strategic venture with chs);
•two canadian nitrogen manufacturing facilities, located in medicine hat, alberta (the largest nitrogen complex in canada) and courtright, ontario;
•a united kingdom nitrogen manufacturing facility located in billingham;
•an extensive system of terminals and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern united states; and cf industries holdings, inc.
•a 50% interest in point lisas nitrogen limited (plnl), an ammonia production joint venture located in the republic of trinidad and tobago (trinidad) that we account for under the equity method.
our strategy our strategy is to leverage our unique capabilities to accelerate the world's transition to clean energy. we believe this strategy builds upon the company's leadership in ammonia production to capture emerging opportunities available to ammonia produced with a lower carbon intensity than that of ammonia produced through traditional processes. these opportunities include traditional applications in agriculture to help reduce the carbon footprint of food production and the life cycle carbon intensity of ethanol production, enabling its use for sustainable aviation fuel, among other purposes. they also include new applications, such as power generation and marine shipping, that would use the hydrogen component of the ammonia molecule for clean energy given that ammonia does not contain or emit carbon when combusted.
we execute our strategy across four dimensions: decarbonizing our existing network to accelerate the availability of low-carbon ammonia; evaluating new low-carbon ammonia capacity growth; forging partnerships to accelerate our timeline and bridge gaps in areas where we do not have expertise; and collaborating to build understanding of ammonia's clean energy capability, safety track record and regulatory environment.
decarbonization projects in our existing network include our green ammonia project at our donaldsonville, louisiana complex. green ammonia refers to ammonia produced with hydrogen sourced through an electrolysis process that produces no carbon emissions. in april 2021, we signed an engineering and procurement contract with thyssenkrupp to supply a 20 mw alkaline water electrolysis plant to produce green hydrogen at our donaldsonville complex. we will integrate the green hydrogen generated by the electrolysis plant into existing ammonia synthesis loops to enable the production of approximately 20,000 tons per year of green ammonia. the green hydrogen production facility is mechanically complete, and commissioning activities began in early 2024. we believe that the donaldsonville green ammonia project will be the largest of its kind in north america at the time of its startup.
decarbonization projects in our existing network also include the production of low-carbon ammonia. low-carbon ammonia is ammonia produced by conventional processes but with approximately 60-98% of the process and flue gas co2 generated by ammonia production removed through carbon capture and sequestration (ccs). we are executing a project also at our donaldsonville complex that will enable us to produce a significant volume of low-carbon ammonia. at an estimated cost of $200 million, we are constructing a co2 dehydration and compression facility to enable ccs at the facility. engineering activities for the construction of the dehydration and compression unit continue to advance, all major equipment for the facility has been procured, fabrication of the co2 compressors is proceeding, and construction activities at the donaldsonville site are underway. once the dehydration and compression unit is in service and sequestration is initiated, we expect that the donaldsonville complex will have the capacity to dehydrate and compress up to 2 million tons per year of process co2, thereby converting a portion of our existing ammonia production to low-carbon ammonia. in october 2022, we announced that we had entered into a definitive co2 offtake agreement with exxonmobil to transport and permanently sequester the co2 from donaldsonville. start-up for the project is planned for 2025. under current regulations, the project would be expected to qualify for tax credits under section 45q of the internal revenue code, which provides a credit per tonne of co2 sequestered.
alongside these projects, we are also evaluating the construction of greenfield low-carbon ammonia capacity in louisiana. in the fourth quarter of 2023, we and mitsui & co., ltd. (mitsui) completed a front-end engineering and design (feed) study on a greenfield steam methane reforming (smr) ammonia facility with ccs technologies. the feed study estimates the cost of a project with these attributes to be in the range of $3 billion, with approximately $2.5 billion allocated to the ammonia facility and ccs technologies and approximately $500 million allocated to scalable common infrastructure for the site, such as ammonia storage and vessel loading docks.
we and mitsui are progressing two additional feed studies focused on technologies with the potential to further reduce the carbon intensity of the proposed low-carbon ammonia facility, including a feed study evaluating autothermal reforming (atr) ammonia production technology and a feed study assessing the cost and viability of adding flue gas capture to an smr ammonia facility. we expect to complete both feed studies in the second half of 2024.
we and mitsui are targeting the second half of 2024 for the final investment decision on the proposed greenfield low-carbon ammonia facility. should the companies agree to move forward, the ammonia facility would be constructed at our new blue point complex. we own the land for the complex, which is located on the west bank of the mississippi river in ascension parish, louisiana. construction and commissioning of a new world-scale ammonia plant typically takes approximately four years from the time construction begins.
in addition to ongoing discussions with existing customers who have interest in forthcoming availability of low-carbon ammonia for traditional applications, we are engaged in advanced discussions regarding the supply of low-carbon ammonia for cf industries holdings, inc.
new applications. in the first quarter of 2023, we signed a memorandum of understanding (mou) with jera co., inc. (jera), japan's largest energy generator, regarding the long-term supply of up to 500,000 tonnes per year of clean ammonia beginning in 2027. the execution of the mou was the result of a supplier comparison and evaluation process for the procurement of clean ammonia that jera initiated in february 2022 for the world's first commercial scale ammonia co-firing operations that jera is developing. the mou establishes a framework for jera and us to assess how we would best supply jera with clean ammonia, which will be required to be produced with at least 60% lower carbon emissions than conventionally produced ammonia, under a long-term offtake agreement. we and jera are evaluating a range of potential supply options, including jera making an equity investment with us to develop a clean ammonia facility in louisiana and a supplementary long-term offtake agreement.
we are also evaluating and in various stages of developing discussions and agreements with other companies for clean ammonia long-term offtake opportunities related to new applications of ammonia.
industry factors we operate in a highly competitive, global industry. our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors, including those outlined below.
global supply and demand factors our products are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition. the customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on reliability, customer service and product quality. the selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions, changes in supply and demand and cost factors.
historically, global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth, gross domestic product growth, changes in dietary habits, planted acreage, and application rates, among other things. we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on long-term fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future. short-term fertilizer demand growth may depend on global economic conditions, farm sector income, weather patterns, the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption, fertilizer application rates, and governmental regulations, including fertilizer subsidies or requirements mandating increased use of bio-fuels or industrial nitrogen products, such as def. geopolitical factors such as temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention, shipping delays and/or cost increases resulting from regional conflicts or changes in the buying/selling patterns of key exporting/consuming countries, including china, india, russia and brazil, among others, often play a major role in shaping near-term market fundamentals. the economics of nitrogen-based fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity. supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs and availability, government policies and global trade. raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal; therefore, supply costs are affected by the supply of and demand for those commodities.
global trade in fertilizer profitability of our products within a particular geographic region is determined not only by the relationship between global supply and demand, but also by the supply/demand balance within that region. regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions. some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product, relative currency values, the availability of credit, agricultural supply and demand, industrial product demand and policies such as emissions abatement, government support for manufacturers or purchasers and governmental nitrogen product trade policies, including the imposition of duties, tariffs or quotas, that affect foreign trade or investment. government energy or carbon policies may also affect regional nitrogen supply and demand. the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america has decreased natural gas costs in north america relative to the rest of the world, making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive. changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world.
the north american nitrogen fertilizer market for certain nitrogen products is dependent on imports to balance supply and demand, and imports traditionally account for a significant portion of nitrogen fertilizer products consumed in north america. producers of nitrogen-based fertilizers located in the middle east, trinidad, africa and russia have been major exporters to north america in recent years.
cf industries holdings, inc.
farmers' economics the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers. individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest, while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns, crop and fertilizer prices, fertilizer products used and timing of applications, expected yields and the types of crops planted.
market conditions geopolitical environment changes in the geopolitical environment can have significant effects on our financial results. russia's invasion of ukraine in february 2022, and the resulting war between russia and ukraine, disrupted global markets for certain commodities, including natural gas, nitrogen fertilizers and certain commodity grains and oilseeds, leading to production curtailments, export reductions and logistical complications involving these commodities. additionally, energy, financial and transportation sanctions were announced by u.s., canadian, european and other governments against russia in response to the war. during 2022 and 2023, market participants continued to adjust trade flows and manufacturers have continued to adjust production levels in response to changing conditions resulting from these factors. as of the date of filing of this report, nitrogen fertilizers have largely been explicitly exempted from sanctions against russia by the united states and certain other governments, and as a result, there has been an increase in russian fertilizer exports into the united states and other parts of the world.
as further described below, natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce our nitrogen products. natural gas is a globally traded commodity that experiences price fluctuations based on supply and demand balances and has been impacted by geopolitical events, including the war between russia and ukraine. european energy markets, which have historically sourced a substantial portion of their natural gas from russia, were disrupted by russia's invasion of ukraine and the subsequent reduction of russian natural gas supply to europe during 2022. this led to further increases in natural gas prices and natural gas price volatility, which in turn have led to disruptions in manufacturing and distribution activities at other nitrogen manufacturers and suppliers in our industry, resulting in changes in nitrogen product trade flows and reductions in global fertilizer supply. in september 2022, in response to the high prices for natural gas in the united kingdom, we idled ammonia production at our billingham complex and since that time have been importing ammonia from one of our other manufacturing facilities or from purchases in the open market for upgrade into an and other nitrogen products at our billingham complex. in the third quarter of 2023, we approved our plan to permanently close the ammonia plant at our billingham complex.
the geopolitical developments that began in 2022 relating to the war in ukraine also led to some supply chain disruptions for russian and other producers of fertilizer, contributing to reduced global nitrogen fertilizer supply. in particular, disruptions in nitrogen exports from russia, a leading exporter of nitrogen fertilizer products globally, and nitrogen production in europe, as a result of higher and more volatile natural gas prices as russian-sourced natural gas supply declined, contributed to reduced nitrogen supply globally. in addition, russia and ukraine have been large exporters of commodity grains such as wheat, corn and soybeans. the direct and indirect impacts of the war in ukraine, and the related uncertainty, resulted in reduced commodity grain supply from russia and ukraine, causing increased prices for grains globally. the increase in commodity grain prices in turn supported strong demand for nitrogen fertilizer in 2022.
these geopolitical developments further contributed to an already tight global supply and demand balance for nitrogen fertilizers, causing changes in global trade flows as both manufacturers and customers reacted to the changing market dynamics. as a result, global nitrogen fertilizer prices remained high and experienced significant volatility in 2022.
as russian-sourced natural gas supply declined due to geopolitical factors, european purchasers of natural gas increased imports of liquefied natural gas (lng) to build storage levels leading up to the winter 2022/2023 peak demand season. as storage levels of natural gas increased due to the increased lng imports, in conjunction with a warmer than normal winter in europe, prices for natural gas fell during the first half of 2023 and then stabilized during the third quarter of 2023. as natural gas prices decreased, certain nitrogen producers restarted previously idled production, leading to an increase in global nitrogen production operating rates. the increased global nitrogen product supply availability resulting from the increase in operating rates, in addition to new global production coming on line and an increase in imports of russian uan into the united states, resulted in an increase in supply and lower average selling prices in 2023 compared to average selling prices realized in 2022. russian exports of ammonia, which had been curtailed due to reduced pipeline flow, may also increase in 2024 as russian producers develop alternative avenues to export product.
cf industries holdings, inc.
we expect that these geopolitical events, and any further government-imposed sanctions or other government actions affecting food or energy security, will continue to have an impact on the supply and demand balance of nitrogen fertilizer products globally and selling prices for our nitrogen fertilizer products.
in addition, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continuing into 2024, there have been escalating conflicts in the middle east. this has led to shipping disruptions as shippers avoid conflicts in the red sea, which increases shipping times and costs as both producers and customers adjust shipping routes and trade flows. these regional conflicts could lead to more widespread geopolitical disruption.
nitrogen selling prices and sales volume our nitrogen products are globally traded commodities with selling prices that fluctuate in response to global market conditions, changes in supply and demand, and other cost factors including domestic and local conditions. intense global competition-reflected in import volumes and prices-strongly influences delivered prices for nitrogen fertilizers. in general, the prevailing global prices for nitrogen products must be at a level to incent the high cost marginal producer to produce product at a breakeven or above price, or else they would cease production and leave a portion of global demand unsatisfied.
average selling prices for all of our major products were lower in 2023 than in 2022, as lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand. in addition, the higher average selling prices in 2022 were driven in part by the geopolitical environment, as described above. the average selling price for our products was $347 per ton in 2023 compared to $610 per ton in 2022. the 43% decrease in the average selling prices for our products in 2023 compared to 2022 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net sales of approximately $4.98 billion.
our total sales volume was 4% higher in 2023 than in 2022, due primarily to higher sales volume in our uan, ammonia and other segments. we shipped 19.1 million tons of product in 2023 compared to 18.3 million tons in 2022. the increase in total sales volume resulted in an increase in net sales of approximately $426 million. the impact of the waggaman acquisition, which is included in our operating results since the acquisition on december 1, 2023, increased our sales volume by 57,000 tons and our net sales by $28 million.
sales volume for our products in 2023, 2022 and 2021 is shown in the table below.

natural gas natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce our nitrogen products. natural gas is both a chemical feedstock and a fuel used to produce nitrogen products. natural gas is a significant cost component of our manufactured nitrogen products, representing approximately 40% and 50%, respectively, of our production costs in 2023 and 2022.

most of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada. as a result, the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses. throughout 2023, there were several factors that led to lower average north american natural gas prices compared to 2022. warmer-than-normal temperatures in the cf industries holdings, inc.
first quarter of 2023 drove lower heating demand for natural gas, while north american supply remained strong, as there were few weather-related production disruptions. in addition, although the higher cost for natural gas outside of north america incentivized liquefaction facilities in the united states to export domestic natural gas during 2023, the outage at the freeport lng facility in the first quarter of 2023 as well as planned maintenance in 2023 at several other lng facilities limited total gas exports, resulting in greater domestic supply availability. in the fourth quarter of 2023, a warmer-than-average start to the winter season led to lower-than-expected heating demand, while north american natural gas production during the fourth quarter of 2023 was at historical highs. as a result, injection rates into natural gas storage in the united states during the fourth quarter of 2023 exceeded historical averages, leading to end-of-year storage levels that were 19% higher than one year earlier and 13% higher than the five-year average.
our billingham u.k. nitrogen manufacturing facility, prior to its ceasing ammonia production beginning in september 2022, was subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe. russia's invasion of ukraine in february 2022 disrupted european energy markets and threatened security of supply, driving natural gas prices in europe upward to unprecedented levels. the average daily market price of natural gas at the national balancing point (nbp), the major trading point for natural gas in the united kingdom, was $24.56 for 2022. in september 2022, as a result of extremely high and volatile natural gas prices and the lack of a corresponding increase in global nitrogen product market prices, we idled ammonia production at our billingham complex. since that time, we have imported ammonia for upgrade into an and other nitrogen products at our billingham complex. in the third quarter of 2023, we approved our plan to permanently close the ammonia plant at our billingham complex. as a result, we continue to import ammonia for upgrade.
the total cost of natural gas used for production at our manufacturing facilities, which includes the impact of realized natural gas derivatives, decreased 49% to $3.67 per mmbtu in 2023 from $7.18 per mmbtu in 2022. the decrease in natural gas costs in 2023 as compared to 2022 resulted in an increase in gross margin of approximately $1.16 billion.
financial executive summary we reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $1.53 billion in 2023 compared to $3.35 billion in 2022, a decrease in net earnings of 54%, or $1.82 billion. the decrease in net earnings reflects a decrease in gross margin partially offset by the following: a lower income tax provision, lower net interest expense, a decrease in net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, and impairment charges related to our u.k. operations in 2022 that did not recur in 2023.
gross margin decreased by $3.32 billion to $2.55 billion for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022. the decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a 43% decrease in average selling prices to $347 per ton in 2023 from $610 per ton in 2022, which decreased gross margin by $4.98 billion. the impact of lower selling prices was partially offset by lower natural gas costs, which increased gross margin by $1.16 billion.
lower gross margin was partially offset by the following: a decrease in the income tax provision of $748 million due primarily to lower pre-tax earnings in 2023, a $287 million decrease in net interest expense, and a decrease of $278 million in net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest. in addition, pre-tax impairment and restructuring charges of $258 million related to our u.k. operations were recognized in 2022 compared to $10 million in 2023.
diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased $8.51 per share, to $7.87 per share in 2023 compared to $16.38 per share in 2022 due primarily to lower net earnings, partially offset by lower weighted-average common shares outstanding as a result of shares repurchased under our share repurchase programs.
acquisition of waggaman ammonia production facility on december 1, 2023, we acquired an ammonia production facility located in waggaman, louisiana from dyno nobel louisiana ammonia, llc (dnla), a u.s. subsidiary of australia-based incitec pivot limited (ipl), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with dnla and ipl. the facility has a nameplate capacity of 880,000 tons of ammonia annually.
in connection with the acquisition, we entered into a long-term ammonia offtake agreement providing for us to supply up to 200,000 tons of ammonia per year to ipl's dyno nobel, inc. subsidiary. under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, $425 million of the purchase price of $1.675 billion, subject to adjustment, was allocated by the parties to the ammonia offtake agreement. we funded the balance of the purchase price with $1.223 billion of cash on hand.
the consideration transferred reflects an estimated net working capital adjustment and other adjustments to the purchase price, which is subject to further adjustment pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement. we expect any further purchase price adjustments required under the asset purchase agreement will be completed in 2024.
the financial results of the waggaman facility are included in our consolidated statement of operations and in our cf industries holdings, inc.
ammonia segment from the acquisition date of december 1, 2023. for the year ended december 31, 2023, the amount of net sales and net earnings of the waggaman facility since the acquisition date was $28 million and $7 million, respectively.

(6)the after-tax income tax provision amount of $65 million reflects an income tax provision of $70 million, consisting of the $78 million income tax provision referenced below under "canada revenue agency competent authority matter" and the $8 million of income tax benefit referenced below under "transfer pricing positions," net of $5 million of income tax provision that is reflected in the after-tax interest expense and interest income amounts shown in this table.
unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives natural gas is the largest and most volatile single component of the manufacturing cost for our nitrogen-based products. at certain times, we have managed the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments. the derivatives that we use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps, basis swaps and options. we use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk, but without the application of hedge accounting. this can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives, which are reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. in 2023 and 2022, we recognized an unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives of $(39) million and $41 million, respectively.

loss on foreign currency transactions, including intercompany loans in 2022, we recognized a loss on foreign currency transactions of $28 million, which consists of foreign currency exchange rate impacts on foreign currency denominated transactions, including the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany loans that were not permanently invested.
u.k. operations in 2023, we recognized total charges of $10 million, consisting primarily of the recognition of an asset retirement obligation and post-employment benefits related to contractual and statutory obligations due to employees as a result of our approved plan to permanently close the ammonia plant at our billingham complex.
in 2022, we recognized total charges of $258 million, consisting primarily of asset impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment at our billingham and ince facilities and definite-lived intangible assets. see note 7-united kingdom operations restructuring and impairment charges for further information.
acquisition and integration costs on december 1, 2023, we acquired an ammonia production facility located in waggaman, louisiana, as described above under "acquisition of waggaman ammonia production facility." in 2023, we incurred $39 million of acquisition and integration costs related to the waggaman acquisition.
unrealized gain on embedded derivative liability under the terms of our strategic venture with chs, if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels, we are required to make a non-refundable yearly payment of $5 million to chs until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to above such levels by two of the three specified credit rating agencies or february 1, 2026. this obligation is recorded at fair value and has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as an embedded derivative. beginning in 2016, our credit ratings were below such levels and, as a result, under the terms of the strategic venture, we made an annual payment of $5 million to chs in the fourth quarter of each year from 2016 through 2021. our credit rating was upgraded above certain levels in july 2022 by one of the specified credit rating agencies and in october 2022 by another one of the specified credit rating agencies. as a result of these upgrades, in the fourth quarter of 2022, there was a reduction in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability, and we recognized an unrealized gain of $14 million.
impairment of equity method investment in plnl plnl, our joint venture in trinidad, operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied, under a gas sales contract (the ngc contract), by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited (ngc). the ngc contract had an expiration date of september 2023. in the third quarter of 2023, plnl entered into a new gas sales contract with ngc (the new ngc contract), which is effective october 2023 through december 2025.
in the third quarter of 2023 and due to the terms of the new ngc contract, we assessed our investment in plnl for impairment and determined that the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl exceeded its fair value. as a result, we recorded an impairment of our equity method investment in plnl of $43 million, which is reflected in equity in (loss) earnings of operating affiliate in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2023.
pension settlement loss and curtailment gains-net on july 15, 2022, we entered into an agreement with an insurance company to purchase a non-participating group annuity contract and transfer approximately $375 million of our primary u.s. defined benefit pension plan's projected benefit obligation. the transaction closed on july 22, 2022 and was funded with plan assets. under the transaction, the insurance company assumed responsibility for pension benefits and annuity administration for approximately 4,000 retirees or their beneficiaries. as a result of this transaction, in the third quarter of 2022, we remeasured the plan's projected benefit obligation and plan assets, and we recognized a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement loss of $24 million, reflecting the unamortized net unrecognized postretirement benefit costs related to the settled obligations, with a corresponding offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss. in the fourth quarter of 2022, the final settlement of the non-participating group annuity contract resulted in a refund of $4 million to us, which decreased the non-cash pre-tax pension settlement loss recognized by $3 million to $21 million. the settlement loss is reflected in other non-operating-net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2022.

in october 2022, we remeasured certain of our u.s. and canadian defined benefit pension plans due to plan amendments resulting from a revision to our north american retirement plan strategy. as a result of these plan amendments, we recognized $4 million of curtailment gains, which is reflected in other non-operating-net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2022. see note 13-pension and other postretirement benefits for further information.
canada revenue agency competent authority matter in 2016, the canada revenue agency (cra) and alberta tax and revenue administration (alberta tra) issued notices of reassessment for tax years 2006 through 2009 to one of our canadian subsidiaries asserting a disallowance of certain patronage deductions. we filed notices of objection with respect to the notices of reassessment with the cra and alberta tra and posted letters of credit in lieu of paying the additional tax liability assessed. the letters of credit served as security until the matter was resolved. in 2018, the matter, including the related transfer pricing topic regarding the allocation of profits between canada and the united states, was accepted for consideration under the bilateral settlement provisions of the u.s.-canada tax treaty (the treaty) by the united states and canadian competent authorities, and included tax years 2006 through 2011. in the second quarter of 2021, the company submitted the transfer pricing aspect of the matter into the arbitration process under the terms of the treaty.
in february 2022, we were informed that a decision was reached by the arbitration panel for tax years 2006 through 2011. in march 2022, we received further details of the results of the arbitration proceedings and the settlement provisions between the united states and canadian competent authorities, and we accepted the decision of the arbitration panel. under the terms of the arbitration decision, additional income for tax years 2006 through 2011 was subject to tax in canada, resulting in our having additional canadian tax liability for those tax years. see note 12-income taxes for additional information.
in 2022, as a result of the impact of these events on our canadian and u.s. federal and state income taxes, we recognized an income tax provision of $78 million, reflecting the net impact of $129 million of accrued income taxes payable to canada for tax years 2006 through 2011, partially offset by net income tax receivables of approximately $51 million in the united states, and we accrued net interest of $102 million, primarily reflecting the estimated interest payable to canada.
transfer pricing positions as a result of the outcome of the arbitration decision discussed above, we also evaluated our transfer pricing positions between canada and the united states for open years 2012 and after. based on this evaluation, we recorded the following in 2022:
•liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $159 million, with a corresponding income tax provision, and accrued interest of $59 million related to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, and
•noncurrent income tax receivables of $188 million, with a corresponding income tax benefit, and accrued interest income of $20 million related to the noncurrent income tax receivables.
in 2022, the impact of these evaluations of transfer pricing positions on our consolidated statement of operations, including $21 million of net deferred income tax provision for other transfer pricing tax effects, was $8 million of income tax benefit and $39 million of net interest expense before tax ($44 million after tax).
loss on debt extinguishment on april 21, 2022, we redeemed in full all of the $500 million outstanding principal amount of the 3.450% senior notes due june 2023 (the 2023 notes) in accordance with the optional redemption provisions in the indenture governing the 2023 notes. the total aggregate redemption price paid in connection with the april 2022 redemption of the 2023 notes was $513 million, including accrued interest. as a result, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $8 million, consisting primarily of the premium paid on the redemption of the $500 million principal amount of the 2023 notes prior to their scheduled maturity.

the following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to the year ended december 31, 2022. for a discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2022 annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec on february 23, 2023.
net sales our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen products and are determined by the quantities of nitrogen products we sell and the selling prices we realize. the volumes, mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors. net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers. sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales.
our net sales decreased $4.56 billion, or 41%, to $6.63 billion in 2023 compared to $11.19 billion in 2022. the decrease in our net sales reflects (i) the impact of the waggaman acquisition, which is included in our operating results since the acquisition on december 1, 2023, and increased our net sales by $28 million, and (ii) a $4.58 billion, or 41%, decline in our net sales excluding the impact of the waggaman acquisition, due to a 43% decrease in average selling prices, partially offset by a 4% increase in sales volume.
our average selling price was $347 per ton in 2023 compared to $610 per ton in 2022, a decrease of 43%, due to lower average selling prices across all of our segments, as lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand. the impact of lower average selling prices was a decrease in net sales of approximately $4.98 billion for 2023 compared to 2022.
our sales volume of 19.1 million product tons in 2023 was 4% higher compared to 18.3 million product tons in 2022, due primarily to higher sales volume in our uan, ammonia and other segments. the impact of the waggaman acquisition increased our ammonia sales volume by 57,000 tons.

gross ammonia production for 2023 decreased to approximately 9.5 million tons compared to 9.8 million tons in 2022, due primarily to our billingham ammonia plant, which was idled in late 2022 and permanently closed in 2023. we expect gross ammonia production for 2024 will be approximately 10 million tons. the expected increase in gross ammonia production for 2024 compared to 2023 reflects the inclusion of the waggaman facility, which we acquired on december 1, 2023.
cost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, purchased product costs, distribution costs and storage costs. manufacturing costs, the most significant element of cost of sales, consist primarily of raw materials, realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives, maintenance, direct labor, depreciation and other plant overhead expenses. purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities. distribution costs consist of the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities, which are recognized in cost of sales when the product is sold to our customers. storage costs consist of costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers.
our cost of sales decreased $1.24 billion, or 23%, to $4.09 billion in 2023 as compared to $5.33 billion in 2022. the decrease in our cost of sales reflects (i) the impact of the waggaman acquisition, which increased our cost of sales by $14 million, (ii) lower costs for natural gas including the impact of realized derivatives, excluding the impact of the waggaman acquisition, which decreased cost of sales by $1.16 billion, and (iii) lower costs for ammonia purchased from plnl, our joint venture in trinidad. lower natural gas costs include the benefit of ceasing ammonia production in the united kingdom and the corresponding reduction in natural gas purchases. for our u.k. operations, the decrease in our cost of sales from lower natural gas costs was partially offset by the cost to import ammonia for upgrading into an and other nitrogen products.
cost of sales also includes the impact of a $39 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in 2023 compared to a $41 million loss in 2022.
cost of sales averaged $214 per ton in 2023, a 26% decrease from $290 per ton in 2022. our cost of natural gas, including the impact of realized derivatives, decreased 49% to $3.67 per mmbtu in 2023 from $7.18 per mmbtu in 2022.
selling, general and administrative expenses our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payroll-related costs for our executive, administrative, legal, financial, it, and sales functions, as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees, including those for corporate initiatives, and amortization of definite-lived intangible assets.
selling, general and administrative expenses were $289 million in 2023 as compared to $290 million in 2022. the decrease was due primarily to charitable contributions in 2022 for the initial funding of the cf industries foundation formed in december 2022 that did not recur in 2023, partially offset by higher costs related to certain corporate initiatives, including higher amortization due to our recently implemented enterprise resource planning (erp) system.
u.k. operations in 2023, related to our u.k. operations, we recognized total charges of $10 million, consisting primarily of the recognition of an asset retirement obligation and post-employment benefits related to contractual and statutory obligations due to employees as a result of our approved plan to permanently close the ammonia plant at our billingham complex.
in 2022, related to our u.k. operations, we recognized total charges of $258 million, consisting of $239 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to property, plant and equipment at our billingham and ince facilities and definite-lived intangible assets and $19 million of restructuring charges primarily related to post-employment benefits related to contractual and statutory obligations and one-time termination benefits. see note 7-united kingdom operations restructuring and impairment charges for further information.
acquisition and integration costs on december 1, 2023, we acquired an ammonia production facility located in waggaman, louisiana, as described above under "acquisition of waggaman ammonia production facility." in 2023, we incurred $39 million of acquisition and integration costs related to the waggaman acquisition.

other operating-net other operating-net includes administrative costs that do not relate directly to our central operations. costs included in "other operating costs" can include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives, litigation expenses, gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets and feed study costs related to our clean energy initiatives.
other operating-net was $31 million of income in 2023 compared to $10 million of expense in 2022. the income in 2023 consists primarily of gains on sales of emission credits, partially offset by feed study costs for our clean energy initiatives. see "our strategy," above, for additional information related to our clean energy initiatives.
the expense in 2022 primarily includes a loss on foreign currency transactions of $28 million, which consists of foreign currency exchange rate impacts on foreign currency denominated transactions, including the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany loans that were not permanently invested. the loss on foreign currency transactions in 2022 was partially offset by an unrealized gain of $14 million related to an embedded derivative liability. see "items affecting comparability of results-unrealized gain on embedded derivative liability," above, for further information.
equity in (loss) earnings of operating affiliate equity in (loss) earnings of operating affiliate consists of our 50% ownership interest in plnl. we include our share of the net earnings from our equity method investment in plnl as an element of earnings from operations because this investment provides additional production and is integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities.
equity in (loss) earnings of operating affiliate was an $8 million loss in 2023 compared to $94 million of earnings in 2022. the $8 million loss in 2023 includes an impairment of our equity method investment in plnl of $43 million recognized in the third quarter of 2023. see "items affecting comparability of results-impairment of equity method investment in plnl," above, for further discussion. lower equity in earnings of operating affiliate also reflects a decrease in the operating results of plnl as a result of lower ammonia selling prices, partially offset by lower natural gas costs.
interest expense interest expense includes interest on our long-term debt, amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements, annual fees pursuant to our revolving credit agreement and interest on tax liabilities. capitalized interest relating to the construction of major capital projects reduces interest expense as the interest is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
interest expense was $150 million in 2023 compared to $344 million in 2022. the decrease of $194 million was due primarily to $184 million of tax-related interest expense recorded in 2022, including $170 million of interest expense related to income tax matters described under "items affecting comparability of results-canada revenue agency competent authority matter" and "items affecting comparability of results-transfer pricing positions," above. the decrease in interest expense was also due in part to lower interest expense on borrowings due to the redemption in full of all of the $500 million principal amount of the 2023 notes in april 2022 prior to their scheduled maturity.
interest income interest income includes amounts earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments and any interest earned related to income tax refunds.
interest income was $158 million in 2023 compared to $65 million in 2022. the increase of $93 million reflects a $102 million increase in interest income on short-term investments in 2023 due primarily to higher interest rates. partially offsetting this effect of higher interest rates was interest income recorded in 2022 that did not recur in 2023, which was related to income tax matters described under "items affecting comparability of results-canada revenue agency competent authority matter" and "items affecting comparability of results-transfer pricing positions," above.
loss on debt extinguishment loss on debt extinguishment of $8 million in 2022 is described under "items affecting comparability of results-loss on debt extinguishment," above.

other non-operating-net other non-operating-net was $10 million of income in 2023 compared to $15 million of expense in 2022. the variance was due primarily to the impact of defined benefit pension plan transactions in 2022, including a pension settlement loss of $21 million and curtailment gains of $4 million, which are described under "items affecting comparability of results-pension settlement loss and curtailment gains-net," above.
income tax provision our income tax provision for 2023 was $410 million on pre-tax income of $2.25 billion, or an effective tax rate of 18.3%, compared to an income tax provision of $1.16 billion on pre-tax income of $5.10 billion, or an effective tax rate of 22.7%, in 2022.
our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in cfn, as our consolidated income tax provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest. our effective tax rate for 2023 of 18.3%, which is based on pre-tax income of $2.25 billion, would be 2.9 percentage points higher, or 21.2%, if based on pre-tax income exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest of $313 million. our effective tax rate for 2022 of 22.7%, which is based on pre-tax income of $5.10 billion, would be 3.0 percentage points higher, or 25.7%, if based on pre-tax income exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest of $591 million.
for 2022, our income tax provision includes $22 million of income tax expense to record a valuation allowance in the united kingdom, $23 million of income tax benefit for the excess tax benefit related to certain share-based compensation activity and $78 million of income tax provision related to the canada revenue agency competent authority matter, which is described above under "items affecting comparability of results."
both 2023 and 2022 were impacted by additional discrete tax items. see note 12-income taxes for additional information.
net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest includes the net earnings attributable to the approximately 11% chs minority equity interest in cfn, a subsidiary of cf holdings.
net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased $278 million, or 47%, to $313 million in 2023 compared to $591 million in 2022 due to lower earnings of cfn driven by lower average selling prices as described above under "net sales."
diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased 52% to $7.87 per diluted share in 2023 from $16.38 per diluted share in 2022. this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in gross margin, driven by lower average selling prices, partially offset by lower costs for natural gas. lower gross margin was partially offset by a decrease in the income tax provision resulting from lower profitability, a decrease in interest expense due primarily to interest expense on tax liabilities in 2022 related to canadian-u.s. transfer pricing matters that did not recur in 2023, a decrease in net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest of $278 million, and pre-tax impairment and restructuring charges related to our u.k. operations of $258 million in 2022 compared to $10 million in 2023. additionally, diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding declined 5% from 204.2 million shares for 2022 to 193.8 million shares for 2023, due primarily to repurchases of common shares under our share repurchase programs.

operating results by business segment our reportable segment structure reflects how our chief operating decision maker, as defined in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (u.s. gaap), assesses the performance of our reportable segments and makes decisions about resource allocation. these segments are differentiated by products. our management uses gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. total other operating costs and expenses (consisting primarily of selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating-net) and non-operating expenses (consisting primarily of interest and income taxes), are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management. the following table presents summary operating results by business segment:

net sales. net sales in our ammonia segment decreased by $1.41 billion, or 46%, to $1.68 billion in 2023 from $3.09 billion in 2022. the decrease in our net sales reflects (i) the impact of the waggaman acquisition completed on december 1, 2023, which increased net sales by $28 million, and (ii) a $1.44 billion, or 47%, decline in our net sales excluding the impact of the waggaman acquisition, due to a 49% decrease in average selling prices, partially offset by a 6% increase in sales volume. average selling prices decreased to $473 per ton in 2023 compared to $936 per ton in 2022 as lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand. sales volume was higher in 2023 due primarily to higher supply availability resulting from higher beginning inventory.
cost of sales. cost of sales in our ammonia segment averaged $320 per ton in 2023, a 29% decrease from $451 per ton in 2022. the decrease was due primarily to lower realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, and a lower cost per ton for ammonia purchased from plnl, our joint venture in trinidad. the impact of the waggaman acquisition on our cost of sales per ton in our ammonia segment was not material.
gross margin.  gross margin in our ammonia segment decreased by $1.06 billion to $541 million in 2023 from $1.60 billion in 2022, and our gross margin percentage was 32.2% in 2023 compared to 51.7% in 2022. these results reflect (i) the impact of the waggaman acquisition completed on december 1, 2023, which increased gross margin by $14 million, and (ii) a decrease in gross margin of $1.07 billion excluding the impact of the waggaman acquisition, due primarily to a 49% decrease in average selling prices, which decreased gross margin by $1.60 billion. the decrease in average selling prices was partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, which increased gross margin by $293 million, a net decrease in manufacturing, maintenance and other costs, which increased gross margin by $167 million, and a 6% increase in sales volume, which increased gross margin by $40 million. gross margin also includes the impact of an $11 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in 2023 compared to a $13 million loss in 2022.

net sales. net sales in our granular urea segment decreased $1.07 billion, or 37%, to $1.82 billion in 2023 compared to $2.89 billion in 2022 due primarily to a 37% decrease in average selling prices. average selling prices decreased to $399 per ton in 2023 compared to $633 per ton in 2022 as lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand.
cost of sales. cost of sales in our granular urea segment averaged $221 per ton in 2023, a 24% decrease from $291 per ton in 2022, due primarily to lower realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives.
gross margin.  gross margin in our granular urea segment decreased by $751 million to $813 million in 2023 from $1.56 billion in 2022, and our gross margin percentage was 44.6% in 2023 compared to 54.1% in 2022. the decrease in gross margin was driven by a 37% decrease in average selling prices, which decreased gross margin by approximately $1.10 billion, and a net increase in manufacturing, maintenance and other costs, which decreased gross margin by $3 million. these factors that decreased gross margin were partially offset by lower realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, which increased gross margin by $262 million, and the impact of changes in sales volume and mix, which increased gross margin by $68 million. gross margin also includes the impact of an $11 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in 2023 compared to a $13 million loss in 2022.

net sales. net sales in our uan segment decreased $1.50 billion, or 42%, to $2.07 billion in 2023 compared to $3.57 billion in 2022 due primarily to a 46% decrease in average selling prices, partially offset by a 7% increase in sales volume. average selling prices decreased to $286 per ton in 2023 compared to $526 per ton in 2022 due primarily to lower global energy costs reducing the global market clearing price required to meet global demand and an increase in imports of russian uan into the united states. the increase in sales volume was due primarily to strong customer participation in our post-application season sales program as well as higher supply availability resulting from higher production.
cost of sales. cost of sales in our uan segment averaged $173 per ton in 2023, a 21% decrease from $219 per ton in 2022, due primarily to the impact of lower realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives.
gross margin.  gross margin in our uan segment decreased by $1.27 billion to $817 million in 2023 from $2.08 billion in 2022, and our gross margin percentage was 39.5% in 2023 compared to 58.3% in 2022. the decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a 46% decrease in average selling prices, which decreased gross margin by $1.73 billion. this decrease in gross margin was partially offset by lower realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, which increased gross margin by $287 million, a 7% increase in sales volume, which increased gross margin by $146 million and a net decrease in manufacturing, maintenance and other costs, which increased gross margin by $10 million. gross margin also includes the impact of an $11 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in 2023 compared to a $14 million loss in 2022.

(1)an represents between 29% and 35% of nitrogen content. nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.
year ended december 31, 2023 compared to year ended december 31, 2022
in september 2022, as a result of extremely high and volatile natural gas prices and the lack of a corresponding increase in global nitrogen product market prices, we idled ammonia production at our billingham complex. since that time, we have imported ammonia for upgrade at our billingham complex into an and other nitrogen products, which are included in our other segment. in the third quarter of 2023, we approved our plan to permanently close the ammonia plant at our billingham complex.
net sales. net sales in our an segment decreased $348 million, or 41%, to $497 million in 2023 from $845 million in 2022 due primarily to a 40% decrease in average selling prices. average selling prices decreased to $316 per ton in 2023 compared to $530 per ton in 2022 as lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand.
cost of sales. cost of sales in our an segment averaged $228 per ton in 2023, a 39% decrease from $374 per ton in 2022. the decrease was due primarily to lower production costs for our billingham complex in 2023, as purchased ammonia was used for upgrading into an as compared to the higher-cost natural gas used to produce ammonia to upgrade into an in 2022. in addition, the decrease in cost of sales per ton reflects lower realized natural gas costs in north america in 2023 compared to 2022.
gross margin.  gross margin in our an segment decreased by $110 million to $138 million in 2023 from $248 million in 2022, and our gross margin percentage was 27.8% in 2023 compared to 29.3% in 2022. the decrease in gross margin reflects the following:
•a 40% decrease in average selling prices, which decreased gross margin by $286 million, and a 1% decrease in sales volume, which decreased gross margin by $10 million; and
•a decrease in realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, which increased gross margin by $207 million, due primarily to the closure of the ammonia plant at our billingham complex, partially offset by a net increase of $21 million in manufacturing, maintenance and other costs, driven by the cost for purchased ammonia for upgrade at our billingham complex.

other segment our other segment primarily includes the following products:
•diesel exhaust fluid (def), an aqueous urea solution typically made with 32.5% or 50% high-purity urea and the remainder deionized water;
•urea liquor, a liquid product that we sell in concentrations of 40%, 50% and 70% urea as a chemical intermediate; and
•nitric acid, a nitrogen-based mineral acid that is used in the production of nitrate-based fertilizers, nylon precursors and other specialty chemicals.

(1)nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.
year ended december 31, 2023 compared to year ended december 31, 2022
in june 2022, we approved and announced our proposed plan to restructure our u.k. operations, including the planned permanent closure of our ince facility. in august 2022, the final restructuring plan was approved, and decommissioning activities were initiated. we produced compound fertilizer products (npks), which are solid granular fertilizer products for which the nutrient content is a combination of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, only at our ince facility, and closure of this facility resulted in our discontinuation of the npk product line, which was included in our other segment.
in september 2022, as a result of extremely high and volatile natural gas prices in the united kingdom and the lack of a corresponding increase in global nitrogen product market prices, we idled ammonia production at our billingham complex. since that time, we have imported ammonia for upgrade at our billingham complex into an and other nitrogen products, including nitric acid and aqua ammonia, which are included in our other segment. in the third quarter of 2023, we approved our plan to permanently close the ammonia plant at our billingham complex.
net sales. net sales in our other segment decreased $223 million, or 28%, to $564 million in 2023 from $787 million in 2022 due to a 32% decrease in average selling prices, partially offset by a 6% increase in sales volume. average selling prices decreased to $256 per ton in 2023 compared to $379 per ton in 2022 as lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand. the increase in sales volume was due primarily to higher def sales volume.
cost of sales. cost of sales in our other segment averaged $149 per ton in 2023, a 26% decrease from $202 per ton in 2022, due primarily to lower production costs for our billingham complex in 2023, as purchased ammonia was used for upgrading into other nitrogen products as compared to the higher-cost natural gas used to produce ammonia to upgrade into other nitrogen products in 2022. in addition, the decrease in cost of sales per ton reflects lower realized natural gas costs in north america in 2023 compared to 2022.

gross margin.  gross margin in our other segment decreased by $131 million to $236 million in 2023 from $367 million in 2022, and our gross margin percentage was 41.8% in 2023 compared to 46.6% in 2022. the decrease in gross margin reflects the following:
•a 32% decrease in average selling prices, which decreased gross margin by $263 million, partially offset by a 6% increase in sales volume, which increased gross margin by $29 million;
•a decrease in realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, which increased gross margin by $106 million, partially offset by a net increase of $10 million in manufacturing, maintenance and other costs, driven by the cost for purchased ammonia for upgrade at our billingham complex; and
•the impact of a $4 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in 2023 compared to a $3 million loss in 2022.
liquidity and capital resources our primary uses of cash are generally for operating costs, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, investments, taxes, share repurchases, and dividends. our working capital requirements are affected by several factors, including demand for our products, selling prices, raw material costs, freight costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business. we may also utilize our cash to fund acquisitions. in addition, we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
generally, our primary source of cash is cash from operations, which includes cash generated by customer advances. we may also from time to time access the capital markets or engage in borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.
on december 1, 2023, we acquired an ammonia production facility located in waggaman, louisiana. see "acquisition of waggaman ammonia production facility," below, for additional information.
as of december 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $2.03 billion, a decrease of $291 million from $2.32 billion at december 31, 2022. at december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements under our revolving credit agreement and senior notes, and unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement was $750 million.
on january 31, 2024, our board of directors (the board) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per common share, representing an increase from the quarterly dividend of $0.40 per common share that was declared and paid in the fourth quarter of 2023. the dividend will be paid on february 29, 2024 to stockholders of record as of february 15, 2024.
cash equivalents cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less. under our short-term investment policy, we may invest our cash balances, either directly or through mutual funds, in several types of investment-grade securities, including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations. securities issued by governmental entities include those issued directly by the u.s. and canadian federal governments; those issued by state, local or other governmental entities; and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities.
capital spending we make capital expenditures to sustain our asset base, increase our capacity or capabilities, improve plant efficiency, comply with various environmental, health and safety requirements, and invest in our clean energy strategy. capital expenditures totaled $499 million in 2023 compared to $453 million in 2022.
capital expenditures in 2024 are estimated to be in the range of $550 million. planned capital expenditures are generally subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting, unanticipated increases in cost, changes in scope and completion time, performance of third parties, delays in the receipt of equipment, adverse weather, defects in materials and workmanship, labor or material shortages, transportation constraints, acceleration or delays in the timing of the work and other unforeseen difficulties.

acquisition of waggaman ammonia production facility on december 1, 2023, we acquired an ammonia production facility located in waggaman, louisiana from dyno nobel louisiana ammonia, llc (dnla), a u.s. subsidiary of australia-based incitec pivot limited (ipl), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with dnla and ipl. the facility has a nameplate capacity of 880,000 tons of ammonia annually.
in connection with the acquisition, we entered into a long-term ammonia offtake agreement providing for us to supply up to 200,000 tons of ammonia per year to ipl's dyno nobel, inc. subsidiary. under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, $425 million of the purchase price of $1.675 billion, subject to adjustment, was allocated by the parties to the ammonia offtake agreement. we funded the balance of the purchase price with $1.223 billion of cash on hand. the consideration transferred reflects an estimated net working capital adjustment and other adjustments to the purchase price, which is subject to further adjustment pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement. we expect any further purchase price adjustments required under the asset purchase agreement will be completed in 2024.
the financial results of the waggaman facility are included in our consolidated statement of operations and in our ammonia segment from the acquisition date of december 1, 2023. see note 6-acquisition of waggaman ammonia production facility for additional information.

government policies the policies or laws of governments around the world can result in the imposition of taxes, duties, tariffs or other restrictions or regulatory requirements on imports and exports of raw materials, finished goods or services from a particular country or region of the world. the policies and laws of governments can also impact the subsidization of natural gas prices, and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers or farmers. due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production, the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by economic, political and social objectives. additionally, the import or export of fertilizer can be subject to local taxes imposed by governments which can have the effect of either encouraging or discouraging import and export activity. the impact of changes in governmental policies or laws or the political or social objectives of a country could have a material impact on fertilizer demand and selling prices and therefore could impact our liquidity.
repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes we have operations in canada, the united kingdom and a 50% interest in a joint venture in trinidad. historically, the estimated additional u.s. and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the united states were recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings were recognized, unless the earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested based upon our then current plans. however, the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurred at the time of the repatriation. as a result, the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings, as applicable, and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings could occur in different periods.
in light of changes made by the tax cuts and jobs act, commencing with the 2018 tax year, the united states no longer taxes earnings of foreign subsidiaries even when such earnings are earned or repatriated to the united states, unless such earnings are subject to u.s. rules on passive income or certain anti-abuse provisions. foreign subsidiary earnings may still be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated to the united states.
cash balances held by our joint venture are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint venture on a periodic basis.
as of december 31, 2023, approximately $205 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of $2.03 billion was held by our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2023, we recorded a deferred tax liability of $9 million on the undistributed earnings of our canadian subsidiaries for which the company does not have an indefinite reinvestment assertion. we have not provided for deferred taxes on the remainder of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings would not give rise to additional tax liabilities upon repatriation or are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.
debt revolving credit agreement on october 26, 2023, we entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the new revolving credit agreement), which replaced our prior senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the prior revolving credit agreement) that was scheduled to mature on december 5, 2024. the prior revolving credit agreement provided for a revolving credit facility of up to $750 million and included a letter of credit sub-limit of $125 million.
the new revolving credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $750 million with a maturity of october 26, 2028 and includes a letter of credit sub-limit of $125 million. borrowings under the new revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes. cf industries is the lead borrower, and cf holdings is the sole guarantor, under the new revolving credit agreement.
borrowings under the new revolving credit agreement can be denominated in u.s. dollars, canadian dollars, euros and british pounds. borrowings in u.s. dollars bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at our option, an applicable adjusted term secured overnight financing rate or base rate plus, in either case, a specified margin. we are required to pay an undrawn commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the new revolving credit agreement and customary letter of credit fees. the specified margin and the amount of the commitment fee depend on cf holdings' credit rating at the time.

the new revolving credit agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including one financial covenant. the financial covenant requires that the total net leverage ratio (as defined in the new revolving credit agreement) be not greater than 3.75:1.00 (the maximum total net leverage ratio) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, provided that, if any borrower or subsidiary consummates a material acquisition during any fiscal quarter, cf industries may elect to increase the maximum total net leverage ratio to 4.25:1.00 for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters commencing with such fiscal quarter (and no further such election may be made unless and until the maximum total net leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.75:1.00 as of the end of two consecutive fiscal quarters after the end of such period).
as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants under the new revolving credit agreement.
the new revolving credit agreement contains events of default (with notice requirements and cure periods, as applicable) customary for a financing of this type, including, but not limited to, non-payment of principal, interest or fees; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect; and failure to comply with specified covenants. upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the new revolving credit agreement and after any applicable cure period, subject to specified exceptions, the administrative agent may, and at the request of the requisite lenders is required to, accelerate the loans under the new revolving credit agreement or terminate the lenders' commitments under the new revolving credit agreement.
as of december 31, 2023, we had unused borrowing capacity under the new revolving credit agreement of $750 million and no outstanding letters of credit under the new revolving credit agreement. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, and during the years then ended, there were no borrowings outstanding under either the prior revolving credit agreement or the new revolving credit agreement.
letters of credit under bilateral agreement we are party to a bilateral agreement providing for the issuance of up to $425 million (reflecting an increase of $75 million in december 2023) of letters of credit. as of december 31, 2023, approximately $291 million of letters of credit were outstanding under this agreement.

public senior notes on april 21, 2022, we redeemed in full all of the $500 million outstanding principal amount of the 2023 notes in accordance with the optional redemption provisions in the indenture governing the 2023 notes. the total aggregate redemption price paid in connection with the april 2022 redemption of the 2023 notes, which was funded with cash on hand, was $513 million, including accrued interest. as a result, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $8 million, consisting primarily of the premium paid on the redemption of the $500 million principal amount of the 2023 notes prior to their scheduled maturity.
under the indentures (including the applicable supplemental indentures) governing our senior notes due 2034, 2043 and 2044 identified in the table above (the public senior notes), each series of public senior notes is guaranteed by cf holdings. interest on the public senior notes is payable semiannually, and the public senior notes are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at specified make-whole redemption prices.
the indentures governing the public senior notes contain covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of cf holdings and its subsidiaries, including cf industries, to incur liens on certain assets to secure debt, to engage in sale and leaseback transactions, to merge or consolidate with other entities and to sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of cf holdings and its subsidiaries to another entity. each of the indentures governing the public senior notes provides for customary events of default, which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest on the applicable public senior notes; failure to comply with other covenants or agreements under the indenture; certain defaults on other indebtedness; the failure of cf holdings' guarantee of the applicable public senior notes to be enforceable; and specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency. under each indenture governing the public senior notes, in the case of an event of default arising from one of the specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, the applicable public senior notes would become due and payable immediately, and, in the case of any other event of default (other than an event of default related to cf industries' and cf holdings' reporting obligations), the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable public senior notes then outstanding may declare all of such public senior notes to be due and payable immediately.

forward sales and customer advances we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose. therefore, our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment.
customer advances, which typically represent a portion of the contract's value, are received shortly after the contract is executed, with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time control transfers to the customer, thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales. any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until control transfers and revenue is recognized. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $130 million and $229 million, respectively, in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets.
while customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity, the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions, our customers' outlook of future market fundamentals and seasonality. during periods of declining prices, customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation that prices in the future will be lower than the current prices. if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future, our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase. additionally, borrowing under the new revolving credit agreement could become necessary. due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations, we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity.
under our forward sales programs, a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors. these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us. such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customer's inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales.
natural gas natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce our nitrogen products. we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia, granular urea, uan, an and other products. expenditures on natural gas are a significant portion of our production costs, representing approximately 40% of our total production costs in 2023. as a result of these factors, natural gas prices have a significant impact on our operating expenses and can thus affect our liquidity. natural gas costs in our cost of sales, including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives, decreased 49% to $3.67 per mmbtu in 2023 from $7.18 per mmbtu in 2022.
we enter into agreements for a portion of our future natural gas supply and related transportation. as of december 31, 2023, our natural gas purchase agreements have terms that range from four months to three years and a total minimum commitment of approximately $736 million, and our natural gas transportation agreements have terms that range from one to ten years and a total minimum commitment of approximately $106 million. our minimum commitments to purchase and transport natural gas are based on prevailing market-based forward prices excluding reductions for plant maintenance and turnaround activities.
most of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada. as a result, the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses. during 2023, the daily closing price at the henry hub, the most heavily-traded natural gas pricing point in north america, reached a low of $1.72 per mmbtu on three consecutive days in june 2023 and a high of $3.81 per mmbtu on january 5, 2023. during the three-year period ended december 31, 2023, the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of $1.72 per mmbtu on three consecutive days in june 2023 and a high of $23.61 per mmbtu on february 18, 2021.
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future. natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based products. from time to time, we may also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments in the value of the derivatives. in 2023 and 2022, we recognized an unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives of $(39) million and $41 million, respectively, which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations.

derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts. for derivatives that are in net asset positions, we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties. we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are multinational commercial banks, other major financial institutions or large energy companies, and the use of international swaps and derivatives association (isda) master netting arrangements. the isda agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for over-the-counter derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk, in part, by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff, the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement.
the isda agreements for most of our derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features, such as cross default provisions. in the event of certain defaults or termination events, our counterparties may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in net liability positions was $34 million and $73 million, respectively, which also approximates the fair value of the assets that may be needed to settle the obligations if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates.
as of december 31, 2023, our open natural gas derivative contracts consisted of natural gas fixed price swaps, basis swaps and options for 49.0 million mmbtus. as of december 31, 2022, our open natural gas derivative contracts consisted of natural gas fixed price swaps, basis swaps and options for 66.3 million mmbtus. at both december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts. the credit support documents executed in connection with certain of our isda agreements generally provide us and our counterparties the right to set off collateral against amounts owing under the isda agreements upon the occurrence of a default or a specified termination event.
defined benefit pension plans we contributed $44 million to our pension plans in 2023. in 2024 and 2025, we expect to contribute approximately $27 million and $11 million, respectively, to our u.k. pension plans as currently agreed with the plans' trustees.

cash flows net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was $2.76 billion, a decrease of $1.10 billion compared to $3.86 billion in 2022. the decrease in cash flow from operations was due primarily to lower net earnings, partially offset by changes in net working capital. net earnings in 2023 was $1.84 billion compared to $3.94 billion in 2022. the decrease in net earnings was due primarily to a decrease in gross margin, driven by lower average selling prices, partially offset by lower natural gas costs, a lower income tax provision, lower net interest expense, a decrease in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, and impairment charges related to our u.k. operations in 2022 that did not recur in 2023. during 2023, net changes in working capital increased cash flow from operations by $20 million, while in 2022, net changes in working capital reduced cash flow from operations by $900 million. the difference in the impact of changes in working capital on cash flow from operations in 2023 as compared to 2022 was attributable primarily to favorable changes in 2023 as compared to 2022 in accounts receivable, inventory, customer advances and income tax liabilities.
net cash used in investing activities was $1.68 billion in 2023 compared to $440 million in 2022, or an increase of $1.24 billion. the increase was due primarily to the consideration paid of $1.223 billion for the waggaman acquisition. see "acquisition of waggaman ammonia production facility," above for additional information. during 2023, capital expenditures totaled $499 million compared to $453 million in 2022.

net cash used in financing activities was $1.37 billion in 2023 compared to $2.70 billion in 2022. the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in share repurchases and lower distributions to the noncontrolling interest. in 2023, we paid $580 million for share repurchases compared to $1.35 billion for share repurchases in 2022. in 2023, distributions to the noncontrolling interest were $459 million compared to $619 million in 2022. in addition, we paid $507 million in connection with the redemption of the 2023 notes in 2022.
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. u.s. gaap requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. we base our estimates on historical experience, technological assessment, opinions of appropriate outside experts, and the most recent information available to us. actual results may differ from these estimates. changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate. the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting estimates.
acquisition of waggaman ammonia production facility on december 1, 2023, we acquired an ammonia production facility located in waggaman, louisiana from dnla, a u.s. subsidiary of australia-based ipl, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with dnla and ipl. we accounted for the acquisition as a business combination. in connection with the acquisition, we entered into a long-term ammonia offtake agreement providing for us to supply up to 200,000 tons of ammonia per year to ipl's dyno nobel, inc. subsidiary (the supply contract). in connection with recording the acquisition, we recognized, among other items, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets consisting primarily of customer relationships, and a supply contract liability. see note 6-acquisition of waggaman ammonia production facility for additional information.
the valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of our acquisition of the waggaman ammonia production facility on december 1, 2023, requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
we estimated the fair value of the customer relationships of $455 million using the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach, which incorporated the estimated future cash flows associated with the net earnings attributable to the acquired customer relationships. the estimated future cash flows were discounted to their present value using an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate from the perspective of a market participant. key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows include forecasted product selling prices, future production and sales volumes, probability of renewal, projected natural gas costs, operating rates, operating expenses, inflation, tax rates, capital spending, and contributory asset charges, among other factors. the discount rate utilized in estimating the fair value of the customer relationships was 9.0% and was derived using a capital asset pricing model and publicly available data for comparable companies to estimate the cost of equity financing. we used moody's baa corporate bonds as a benchmark to estimate the cost of debt. additional assumptions utilized in the valuation of the customer relationships included the duration of the forecasted cash flows and the tax amortization benefit, among other factors.
the terms of the supply contract were determined to be unfavorable compared to market as of the acquisition date. therefore, we estimated the fair value of the supply contract liability of $757 million using the with and without method of the income approach. this method included estimating the future cash flows by applying both a market price and the contract price in determining the respective forecasted sales. the difference in the estimated future cash flows using the resulting forecasted sales was then discounted to present value at the date of acquisition using an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate from the perspective of a market participant. key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows include forecasted product selling price, specifically the market price in excess of the contract price, future production and sales volumes, probability of renewal, and inflation, among other factors. the discount rate utilized in estimating the fair value of the supply contract liability was 6.2% and was derived based on the historical cost of our issued debt and treasury and corporate bond yields as of the acquisition date. additional assumptions utilized in the valuation of the supply contract liability included the duration of the forecasted cash flows, among other factors.
due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making estimates and assumptions, actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. of the factors discussed above, the following assumptions are more sensitive than others:
•forecasted product selling prices included in the estimated future cash flows utilized in the valuation of the customer relationships and the supply contract liability, cf industries holdings, inc.
•projected natural gas costs included in the estimated future cash flows utilized in the valuation of the customer relationships, and
•the discount rate utilized in each of these valuations to discount the cash flows in arriving at the fair values.
assuming that all other assumptions and estimates utilized in our valuation of the customer relationships and supply contract liability remain unchanged, a change in each of these inputs would have the following effect on the estimated fair value used to allocate the purchase price in the waggaman acquisition as of december 1, 2023:

n/a-not applicable recoverability of long-lived assets, goodwill and investment in unconsolidated affiliate we review the carrying values of our property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, including our finite-lived intangible assets, goodwill and our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate in accordance with u.s. gaap in order to assess recoverability. factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include production and sales volumes, selling prices, raw material costs, operating rates, operating expenses, inflation, discount rates, exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending and the impact that future market dynamics and geopolitical events could have on these factors. judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors, which include inherent uncertainties. the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process. the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill, long-lived assets and our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed. certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business. adverse changes in demand for our products, increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review.
the recoverability and impairment tests of long-lived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. for goodwill, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. when circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment is less than its carrying value, and the reduction in value is other than temporary, the reduction in value would be recognized immediately in earnings.
we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level. our evaluation generally begins with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value. if after performing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then no further analysis is necessary. however, if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test, we perform a quantitative test, which involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. we use an income-based valuation method, determining the present value of future cash flows, to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill impairment would be recognized equal to the amount of the carrying value in excess of the reporting unit's fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
we review property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets at the asset group level in order to assess recoverability based on expected future undiscounted cash flows. if the sum of the expected future net undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be recognized. the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets.

plnl is our joint venture investment in trinidad and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied, under a gas sales contract, by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited (ngc). the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method. the joint venture experienced past curtailments in the supply of natural gas from ngc, which reduced the ammonia production at plnl. the prior gas sales contract had an expiration date of september 2023. in the third quarter of 2023, plnl entered into a new gas sales contract with ngc (the new ngc contract), which is effective october 2023 through december 2025. any ngc commitment to supply gas beyond december 2025 will be based on new agreements.
in the third quarter of 2023 and due to the terms of the new ngc contract, we assessed our investment in plnl for impairment and determined that the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl exceeded its fair value. as a result, we recorded an impairment of our equity method investment in plnl of $43 million, which is reflected in equity in (loss) earnings of operating affiliate on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2023. if ngc does not make sufficient quantities of natural gas available to plnl at prices that permit profitable operations, plnl may cease operating its facility and we would write off the remaining investment in plnl. the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl at december 31, 2023 was $26 million.
projected benefit obligations the projected benefit obligations (pbos) for our defined benefit pension plans are affected by plan design, actuarial estimates and discount rates. key assumptions that affect our pbo are discount rates and, in addition for our united kingdom plans, inflation rates, including an adjusted u.k. retail price index (rpi).
the december 31, 2023 pbo was computed based on a weighted-average discount rate of 4.8% for our north america plans and 4.6% for our united kingdom plans, which were based on yields for high-quality (aa rated or better) fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31, 2023. declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo. for our united kingdom plans, the 3.0% rpi used to calculate our pbo is developed using a u.k. government gilt prices only retail price inflation curve, which is based on the difference between yields on fixed interest government bonds and index-linked government bonds.
for north america qualified pension plans, our pbo was $292 million as of december 31, 2023, which was $21 million lower than pension plan assets. for our united kingdom pension plans, our pbo was $367 million as of december 31, 2023, which was $7 million higher than pension plan assets. the table below estimates the impact of a 50 basis point increase or decrease in the key assumptions on our december 31, 2023 pbo:

income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate, and we recognize expense, assets and liabilities based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions. these tax laws are complex, and how they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation. we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if sustaining those positions is more likely than not. tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold but are not highly certain are measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. differences in interpretation of the tax laws and regulations, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits, can result in differences in taxes paid, which may be higher or lower than our estimates. the judgments made at a point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of, tax laws and regulations, and these changes could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which these changes occur. as of december 31, 2023, we have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties and interest, of $273 million.

we also engage in a significant amount of cross border transactions. the taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators across the globe, including the jurisdictions in which we operate. the tax rules and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which we operate are complex, and in many cases, there is not symmetry between the rules of the various jurisdictions. as a result, there are instances where regulators within the jurisdictions involved in a cross-border transaction may reach different conclusions regarding the taxability of the transaction in their respective jurisdictions based on the same set of facts and circumstances. we work closely with regulators to reach a common understanding and conclusion regarding the taxability of cross border transactions.

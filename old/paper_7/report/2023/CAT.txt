overview total sales and revenues for 2023 were $67.060 billion, an increase of $7.633 billion, or 13 percent, compared with $59.427 billion for 2022. the increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume. profit per share was $20.12 in 2023, compared with profit per share of $12.64 in 2022. profit was $10.335 billion in 2023, compared with $6.705 billion in 2022. the increase was primarily due to favorable price realization, higher sales volume and the absence of a 2022 goodwill impairment charge related to the rail division, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative (sg&a) and research and development (r&d) expenses, unfavorable manufacturing costs, the impact of the divestiture of the company's longwall business and lower mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and other postemployment benefit (opeb) plans.
trends and economic conditions outlook for key end markets overall demand remains healthy across most of our end markets for our products and services.
in construction industries, we expect north america to remain healthy in 2024. we expect non-residential construction in north america to remain at similar demand levels as 2023 due to government-related infrastructure investments. residential construction is expected to remain healthy relative to historical levels. in asia pacific, excluding china, we expect some softening in economic conditions. we anticipate china will remain at a relatively low level in the excavator industry above 10-tons. in eame, we anticipate the region will be slightly down due to economic uncertainty in europe, partially offset by continuing strong construction demand in the middle east. construction activity in latin america is expected to increase due to easing financial conditions. in addition, we anticipate the ongoing benefit of our services initiatives will positively impact construction industries in 2024.
in resource industries, in 2024, for both mining and heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we anticipate lower sales volume compared to 2023, primarily due to off-highway and articulated trucks. while we continue to see a high level of quoting activity overall, we anticipate lower order rates as customers display capital discipline. customer product utilization remains high, the number of parked trucks remains low, the age of the fleet remains elevated and our autonomous solutions continue to have strong customer acceptance. we expect higher services revenues, including robust rebuild activity in 2024. we continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand over time, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for long-term profitable growth.
in energy & transportation, in oil & gas, we expect reciprocating engines and services to increase slightly in 2024 compared to 2023. well servicing in north america is showing some short-term moderation. gas compression order backlog remains healthy and we continue to remain optimistic about future demand. power generation reciprocating engine demand is expected to remain strong due to continued data center growth. solar turbines has a strong backlog and continues to experience robust quoting activity. industrial demand is expected to soften from a strong 2023. in transportation, we anticipate high-speed marine to increase slightly as customers continue to upgrade aging fleets.
company trends and expectations for the full-year 2024, we anticipate sales and revenues will be broadly similar to 2023, supported by continued healthy underlying demand across most of our end markets for our products and services and slightly favorable price realization. we anticipate another year of services growth in 2024. we do not expect a significant change in machine dealer inventories in 2024, compared to an increase in 2023. in construction industries, sales of equipment to end users is expected to be broadly similar to 2023. in construction industries, we do not expect dealer inventory to increase in 2024 as it did in 2023. we also anticipate services initiatives will benefit the segment. resource industries' sales in 2024 are expected to be lower, driven by lower sales volume primarily in off-highway and articulated trucks. we also expect an unfavorable impact from changes in dealer inventories in resource industries. in 2024, we expect services revenues will increase in resource industries. within energy & transportation in 2024, we expect slightly higher sales. power generation, oil & gas and transportation sales are expected to increase. industrial sales are expected to be lower compared to historically strong levels in 2023.
in 2024, we expect a small benefit from price realization during the first half of the year from price actions taken in the second half of 2023. we expect price realization to modestly exceed manufacturing costs, with moderation throughout the year as we lap favorable price trends from 2023. for 2024, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense to be about $1.2 billion, compared to $1.7 billion in 2023. we expect the short-term incentive compensation expense benefit year over year to be offset by increases in sg&a/r&d expenses as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives aimed at future long-term profitable growth, such as services growth and technology, including autonomy, alternative fuels, connectivity and digital and electrification. in addition, we anticipate an impact due to an unfavorable mix of products. in 2024, we expect restructuring costs to be between $300 million and $450 million and expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion. we expect the global annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, to be between 22.5 percent and 23.5 percent.
in the first quarter of 2024, we expect sales and revenues to be broadly similar to the first quarter of 2023. we expect demand to remain healthy, but anticipate slightly lower machine dealer inventory build as compared to the first quarter of 2023. we anticipate price realization will remain favorable. we expect construction industries' sales to remain flat to slightly higher, including favorable price realization. resource industries' sales are expected to be lower driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable price realization. in energy & transportation, we expect sales to be flat to slightly higher.
in the first quarter of 2024, we expect favorable price realization to more than offset unfavorable manufacturing costs. we expect manufacturing costs to increase primarily due to cost absorption. we do not expect an inventory increase as compared to the increase in the first quarter of 2023. we also anticipate an increase in sg&a/r&d expenses due to investment in strategic initiatives. in construction industries, we expect favorable price realization to be offset by increased sg&a/r&d expenses and slightly higher manufacturing costs, including cost absorption. in resource industries, we expect the profit impact from lower sales volume to be partially offset by favorable price realization. in energy & transportation, we anticipate favorable price realization to be offset by higher manufacturing costs.
global business conditions we continue to monitor a variety of external factors around the world, such as supply chain disruptions, inflationary cost and labor pressures. areas of particular focus include transportation, certain components and raw materials. we continue to work to minimize supply chain challenges that may impact our ability to meet customer demand. we continue to assess the environment to determine if additional actions need to be taken.

2023 compared with 2022
consolidated sales and revenues the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2022 (at left) and 2023 (at right). caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's board of directors and employees.
total sales and revenues for 2023 were $67.060 billion, an increase of $7.633 billion, or 13 percent, compared with $59.427 billion in 2022. the increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume. the increase in sales volume was driven by higher sales of equipment to end users, partially offset by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. dealer inventory increased about $2.4 billion during 2022, compared to an increase of about $2.1 billion during 2023.
sales were higher in the three primary segments.
north america sales increased 25 percent driven by higher sales of equipment to end users, favorable price realization and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. dealer inventory increased more during 2023 than during 2022.
sales decreased 2 percent in latin america due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories and lower services sales volume, partially offset by favorable price realization and favorable currency impacts primarily related to the brazilian real. dealer inventory increased during 2022, compared to a decrease during 2023.
eame sales increased 6 percent due to favorable price realization and higher sales of equipment to end users, partially offset by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. dealer inventory increased more during 2022 than during 2023.
asia/pacific sales increased 2 percent driven by favorable price realization, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts, primarily related to the australian dollar and japanese yen, lower sales of equipment to end users and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. dealer inventory increased more during 2022 than during 2023.
dealer inventory increased about $2.1 billion during 2023, compared to an increase of about $2.4 billion during 2022. dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. dealers' demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. delivery times can vary based on availability of product from caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. we do not expect a significant change in machine dealer inventories in 2024.

consolidated operating profit the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2022 (at left) and 2023 (at right). caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's board of directors and employees. the bar entitled other includes consolidating adjustments and machinery, energy & transportation other operating (income) expenses.
operating profit was $12.966 billion in 2023, an increase of $5.062 billion, or 64 percent, compared with $7.904 billion in 2022. the increase was primarily due to favorable price realization, higher sales volume and the absence of a 2022 goodwill impairment charge related to the rail division, partially offset by higher sg&a/r&d expenses, unfavorable manufacturing costs and the impact of the divestiture of the company's longwall business. the increase in sg&a/r&d expenses was primarily driven by investments aligned with strategic initiatives, higher short-term incentive compensation expense and an unfavorable change in fair value adjustments related to deferred compensation plans. unfavorable manufacturing costs reflected lower freight being more than offset by higher material costs, increased period manufacturing costs, the impact of manufacturing inefficiencies and unfavorable cost absorption. cost absorption was unfavorable as inventory increased more during 2022 than during 2023.
short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. expense for 2023 was about $1.7 billion, compared with $1.4 billion in 2022. for 2024, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be about $1.2 billion.
in the first quarter of 2023, the divestiture of the company's longwall business was finalized, resulting in an unfavorable impact to operating profit of $586 million, primarily a non-cash item driven by the release of accumulated foreign currency translation.
operating profit margin was 19.3 percent in 2023, compared with 13.3 percent in 2022.

other profit/loss and tax items
•interest expense excluding financial products in 2023 was $511 million, compared with $443 million in 2022. the increase was due to higher average borrowing rates.
•other income (expense) in 2023 was income of $595 million, compared with income of $1.291 billion in 2022. the change was primarily driven by lower mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and opeb plans and unfavorable impacts from pension and opeb plan costs and foreign currency exchange, partially offset by higher investment and interest income.
•the provision for income taxes for 2023 reflected an annual effective tax rate of 21.4 percent, compared with 23.2 percent for 2022, excluding the discrete items discussed below. the decrease from 2022 was primarily related to changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective.
the 2023 annual effective tax rate excludes the impact of the nondeductible loss of $586 million related to the divestiture of the company's longwall business. the company also recorded a tax charge of $26 million related to $97 million of pension and opeb mark-to-market gains in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to a tax charge of $124 million related to $606 million of mark-to-market gains in the fourth quarter of 2022. in addition, the company recorded a discrete tax benefit of $57 million in 2023 for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative u.s. gaap compensation expense, compared with a $33 million benefit for 2022. in 2023, the company recorded a discrete tax benefit of $88 million due to a change in the valuation allowance for certain non-u.s. deferred tax assets. in 2022, the company also recorded discrete benefits of $90 million to reflect changes in estimates related to prior years and a tax benefit of $36 million related to the goodwill impairment charge of $925 million.
construction industries construction industries' total sales were $27.418 billion in 2023, an increase of $2.149 billion, or 9 percent, compared with $25.269 billion in 2022. the increase was due to favorable price realization, partially offset by lower sales volume. the decrease in sales volume was driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories, partially offset by higher sales of equipment to end users. dealer inventory increased more during 2022 than during 2023.

energy & transportation's profit was $4.936 billion in 2023, an increase of $1.627 billion, or 49 percent, compared with $3.309 billion in 2022. the increase was mainly due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher sg&a/r&d expenses. unfavorable manufacturing costs were driven by higher material costs, increased period manufacturing costs and the impact of manufacturing inefficiencies, partially offset by lower freight. the increase in sg&a/r&d expenses was primarily driven by investments aligned with strategic initiatives and higher short-term incentive compensation expense.
energy & transportation's profit as a percent of total sales was 17.6 percent in 2023, compared with 13.9 percent in 2022.
financial products segment financial products' segment revenues were $3.785 billion in 2023, an increase of $532 million, or 16 percent, compared with $3.253 billion in 2022. the increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates across all regions.
financial products' segment profit was $909 million in 2023, an increase of $45 million, or 5 percent, compared with $864 million in 2022. the increase was mainly due to higher net yield on average earning assets and lower provision for credit losses at cat financial, partially offset by an increase in sg&a expenses.
corporate items and eliminations expense for corporate items and eliminations was $2.090 billion in 2023, a decrease of $319 million from 2022, primarily driven by the absence of a 2022 goodwill impairment charge related to the rail division and decreased expenses due to timing differences, partially offset by higher restructuring costs, which included the impact of the divestiture of the company's longwall business and other restructuring costs, higher corporate costs, an unfavorable change in fair value adjustments related to deferred compensation plans and unfavorable impacts of segment reporting methodology differences.
in the first quarter of 2023, the divestiture of the company's longwall business was finalized, resulting in an unfavorable impact to operating profit of $586 million, primarily a non-cash item driven by the release of accumulated foreign currency translation. this impact was included in total restructuring costs.

liquidity and capital resources sources of funds we generate significant capital resources from operating activities, which are the primary source of funding for our me&t operations. funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and long-term debt issuances. financial products' operations are funded primarily from commercial paper, term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio. during 2023, we had positive operating cash flow within both our me&t and financial products' operations. on a consolidated basis, we ended 2023 with $6.98 billion of cash, a decrease of $26 million from year-end 2022. in addition, me&t has invested in available-for-sale debt securities and bank time deposits that are considered highly liquid and are available for current operations. these me&t securities were $3.85 billion as of december 31, 2023 and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets in the consolidated statement of financial position. we intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position.
consolidated operating cash flow for 2023 was $12.89 billion, up $5.12 billion compared to 2022. the increase was primarily due to higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items and lower working capital requirements. within working capital, changes in inventories and accrued expenses favorably impacted cash flow partially offset by changes in accounts payable and customer advances.
total debt as of december 31, 2023 was $37.88 billion, an increase of $885 million from year-end 2022. debt related to me&t increased $18 million in 2023. debt related to financial products increased by $883 million due to portfolio funding requirements.
we have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $10.50 billion (credit facility) available in the aggregate to both caterpillar and cat financial for general liquidity purposes. based on management's allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the credit facility available to me&t as of december 31, 2023 was $2.75 billion. information on our credit facility is as follows:
•in august 2023, we entered into a new 364-day facility. the 364-day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $825 million is available to me&t) expires in august 2024.
•in august 2023, we amended and extended the three-year facility (as amended and restated, the "three-year facility"). the three-year facility of $2.73 billion (of which $715 million is available to me&t) expires in august 2026.
•in august 2023, we amended and extended the five-year facility (as amended and restated, the "five-year facility"). the five-year facility of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to me&t) expires in august 2028.
at december 31, 2023, caterpillar's consolidated net worth was $19.55 billion, which was above the $9.00 billion required under the credit facility.  the consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholders' equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within aoci.
at december 31, 2023, cat financial's covenant interest coverage ratio was 1.73 to 1.  this was above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the prior four consecutive fiscal quarter period, required by the credit facility.
in addition, at december 31, 2023, cat financial's six-month covenant leverage ratio was 6.88 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 6.95 to 1.  this was below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each december 31, required by the credit facility.
in the event caterpillar or cat financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the credit facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. additionally, in such event, certain of cat financial's other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings.  at december 31, 2023, there were no borrowings under the credit facility.

the other consolidated credit lines with banks as of december 31, 2023 totaled $4.16 billion. these committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements.  caterpillar or cat financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines.
we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies. fitch maintains a "high-a" debt rating, while moody's and s&p maintain a "mid-a" debt rating. a downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies could result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. in the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, me&t's operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from cat financial and access to our committed credit facilities. our financial products' operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our committed credit facilities and other credit line facilities of cat financial, and potential borrowings from caterpillar. in addition, we maintain a support agreement with cat financial, which requires caterpillar to remain the sole owner of cat financial and may, under certain circumstances, require caterpillar to make payments to cat financial should cat financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios.
we facilitate voluntary supplier finance programs (the "programs") through participating financial institutions. we account for the payments made under the programs, the same as our other accounts payable, as a reduction to our cash flows from operations. we do not believe that changes in the availability of the programs will have a significant impact on our liquidity. additional information related to the programs is included in note 1j - "new accounting guidance" of part ii, item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data".
material cash requirements for contractual obligations we believe our balances of cash and cash equivalents of $6.98 billion and available-for-sale debt securities and bank time deposits of $3.85 billion as of december 31, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.
we have committed cash outflows related to postretirement benefit obligations, long-term debt and operating lease agreements. see notes 12, 14 and 20, respectively, of part ii, item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data" for additional information.
we have short-term obligations related to the purchase of goods and services made in the ordinary course of business. these consist of invoices received and recorded as liabilities as of december 31, 2023, but scheduled for payment in 2024 of $7.91 billion. in addition, we have contractual obligations for material and services on order at december 31, 2023, but not yet invoiced or delivered, of $7.22 billion.
we also have long-term contractual obligations primarily for logistics services agreements; systems support, software licenses and development contracts; information technology consulting contracts and outsourcing contracts for benefit plan administration. these obligations total $1.49 billion, with $704 million due in the next 12 months.
machinery, energy & transportation net cash provided by operating activities was $11.69 billion in 2023, compared with $6.36 billion in 2022. the increase was primarily due to higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items and lower working capital requirements. within working capital, changes in inventories and accrued expenses favorably impacted cash flow partially offset by changes in accounts payable and customer advances.
net cash used for investing activities in 2023 was $3.92 billion, compared with net cash used of $1.81 billion in 2022. the change was primarily due to increased investments in securities, net of proceeds from maturities and sale of securities, and an increase in capital spend.
net cash used for financing activities during 2023 was $7.65 billion, compared with net cash used of $6.80 billion in 2022. the change was primarily due to higher share repurchases and dividends paid in 2023.
while our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate, our long-term cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities. our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mid-a rating. next, we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments. then, we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. additional information on cash deployment is as follows:
strong financial position - our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mid-a rating. we track a diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity, leverage, cash flow and margins which align with our cash deployment actions and the various methodologies used by the major credit rating agencies.
operational excellence and commitments - capital expenditures were $1.66 billion during 2023, compared to $1.30 billion in 2022. we expect me&t's capital expenditures in 2024 to be around $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion. we made $361 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans during 2023. in comparison, we made $346 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans in 2022. we expect to make approximately $273 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans in 2024.
fund strategic growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders - we intend to utilize our liquidity and debt capacity to fund targeted investments that drive long-term profitable growth focused in the areas of expanded offerings, services and sustainability, including acquisitions.
as part of our capital allocation strategy, me&t free cash flow is a liquidity measure we use to determine the cash generated and available for financing activities including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. we define me&t free cash flow as cash from me&t operations less capital expenditures, excluding discretionary pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions and cash payments related to settlements with the u.s. internal revenue service. a goal of our capital allocation strategy is to return substantially all me&t free cash flow to shareholders over time in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining our mid-a rating.
our share repurchase plans are subject to the company's cash deployment priorities and are evaluated on an ongoing basis considering the financial condition of the company, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs, the economic outlook, and the health and stability of global credit markets. the timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and investing priorities. in may 2022, the board approved a new share repurchase authorization (the 2022 authorization) of up to $15.0 billion of caterpillar common stock effective august 1, 2022 with no expiration. in 2023, we repurchased $4.98 billion of caterpillar common stock, with $7.8 billion remaining under the 2022 authorization as of december 31, 2023. caterpillar's basic shares outstanding as of december 31, 2023 were approximately 499 million.
each quarter, our board of directors reviews the company's dividend for the applicable quarter. the board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs, the economic outlook, and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend. in december 2023, the board of directors approved maintaining our quarterly dividend representing $1.30 per share, and we continue to expect our strong financial position to support the dividend. dividends paid totaled $2.56 billion in 2023.
financial products financial products operating cash flow was $1.11 billion in 2023, compared with $1.52 billion in 2022. net cash used for investing activities was $1.42 billion in 2023, compared with $356 million used in 2022. the change was primarily due to portfolio related activity. net cash provided by financing activities was $278 million in 2023, compared with net cash used of $964 million in 2022. the change was primarily due to higher portfolio funding requirements.
off-balance sheet arrangements we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily in the form of guarantees. information related to guarantees appears in note 21 - "guarantees and product warranty" of part ii, item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see note 1j - "new accounting guidance" of part ii, item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. the more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, warranty liability, reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. we have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. we review these assumptions at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors. following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each.
residual values for leased assets - we determine the residual value of cat financial's leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value. we estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends. we also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.
upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third-party, in which case we may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale proceeds.
during the term of our leases, we monitor residual values.  for operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis. for finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.
we evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred. when a triggering event occurs, we perform a test for recoverability by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases. if the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, we measure the fair value of the equipment on operating leases in accordance with the fair value measurement framework. we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value.
at december 31, 2023, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was $1.70 billion. without consideration of other factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options, a 10 percent non-temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately $75 million of additional annual depreciation expense.
fair values for goodwill impairment tests - we test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.
we review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. for reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, we do not consider the goodwill impaired. if the carrying value is higher than the fair value, we recognize the difference as an impairment loss.
for reporting units where we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, the process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value. we compute the residual value using the constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity. the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting unit's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. a reporting unit's discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant's perspective. the estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. we categorize the fair value determination as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs.
we completed our annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2023 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. caterpillar's market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the company.
an unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units, particularly long-term growth and profitability, would reduce the fair value of our reporting units. the demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although the impact may vary by reporting unit. the energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the mineral extraction, oil and natural gas industries. decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment test. future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment, depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test. we would report a goodwill impairment as a non-cash charge to earnings.
product warranty liability - at the time we recognize a sale, we record estimated future warranty costs.  we determine the product warranty liability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory.  generally, we base historical claim rates on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside north america).  we develop specific rates for each product shipment month and update them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.  warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.
product liability and insurance loss reserve - we determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels. the amount of these reserves totaled $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the majority of the balance in both 2023 and 2022 consisted of unearned insurance premiums.
postretirement benefits - we sponsor defined benefit pension plans and/or other postretirement benefit plans (retirement healthcare and life insurance) to employees in many of our locations throughout the world. there are assumptions used in the accounting for these defined benefit plans that include discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected rate of compensation increase, the future health care trend rate, mortality and other economic and demographic assumptions. the actuarial assumptions we use may change or differ significantly from actual results, which may result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. we utilize a mark-to-market approach in recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.
primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows:
•we use the assumed discount rate to discount future benefit obligations back to today's dollars. the u.s. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, december 31. the benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing caterpillar's projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate aa bonds available on the measurement date. we use a similar approach to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-u.s. plans. in estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate. this approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
•the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. this rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted by short-term market swings. changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate. for example, a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate. the expected return on plan assets is based on the fair value of plan asset allocations as of our measurement date, december 31.
•we use the expected rate of compensation increase to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. it represents average long-term salary increases. this rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies.
•the assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience. changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate.
•we use the mortality assumption to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants.
postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions sensitivity the effects of a one percentage-point change in certain actuarial assumptions on 2023 pension and opeb costs and obligations are as follows:

1 effective december 31, 2019, all u.s. pension benefits were frozen, and accordingly this assumption is no longer applicable.
see note 12 - "postemployment benefit plans" of part ii, item 8 "financial statement and supplemental data" for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefits.
post-sale discount reserve - we provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. we have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. the most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. the amount of accrued post-sale discounts was $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  the reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly. we adjust the reserve if discounts paid differ from those estimated. historically, those adjustments have not been material.
allowance for credit losses - the allowance for credit losses is management's estimate of expected losses over the life of our finance receivable portfolio calculated using loss forecast models that take into consideration historical credit loss experience, current economic conditions and forecasts and scenarios that capture country and industry-specific economic factors. in addition, we consider qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models, including borrower-specific and company-specific factors. these qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.
we measure the allowance for credit losses on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we determine that similar risk characteristics do not exist. we identify finance receivables for individual evaluation based on past due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate. the allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables' effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable.  in determining collateral value, we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. we also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees.
while management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that in the future, changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers. if the financial health of our customers deteriorates, the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore, could result in a change to our estimated losses.
income taxes - we are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate.  these tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation.  in establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws.  our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law.  future changes in tax law or related interpretations could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. changes in tax law are reflected in the period of enactment with related interpretations considered in the period received.
despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. we record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management's evaluation of the information available at the reporting date.  to be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits.  the benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.  significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement.  adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes.  adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.
deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns.  certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  in making this assessment, management analyzes the trend of u.s. gaap earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  we give less weight in this analysis to mark-to-market adjustments to remeasure our pension and opeb plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends. should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes.
additional information related to income taxes is included in note 6 - "income taxes" of part ii, item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
other matters information related to legal proceedings appears in note 22 - environmental and legal matters of part ii, item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
retirement benefits we recognize mark-to-market gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and opeb plans. mark-to-market gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets generally have the largest impact on mark-to-market gains and losses.

•expected decrease in expense in 2024 compared to 2023 - excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses, our net periodic benefit cost is expected to decrease $56 million in 2024. this expected decrease is primarily due to lower interest cost in 2024 as a result of lower discount rates at year-end 2023 (u.s. pension plans discount rate for 2024 interest cost is 5.0 percent compared to 5.2 percent for 2023) and a higher expected return on assets due to a higher world-wide asset base at year-end 2023 ($16.3 billion) compared to year-end 2022 ($15.8 billion).
•increase in expense in 2023 compared to 2022 - primarily due to lower mark-to-market gains in 2023 compared to 2022 and higher interest cost in 2023 as a result of higher discount rates at year-end 2022.
•increase in expense in 2022 compared to 2021 - primarily due to lower mark-to-market gains in 2022 compared to 2021 and higher interest cost in 2022 as a result of higher discount rates at year-end 2021.
the primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses (gains) for 2023, 2022 and 2021 are described below. we include the net mark-to-market losses (gains) in other income (expense) in the results of operations.
•2023 net mark-to-market gain of $97 million - primarily due to higher actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (u.s. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 10.4 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 5.8 percent) and favorable claims experience related to our other postretirement benefit plans. this was partially offset by lower discount rates at the end of 2023 compared to the end of 2022.
•2022 net mark-to-market gain of $606 million - primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2022 compared to the end of 2021. this was partially offset by a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (u.s. pension plans had an actual loss rate of (22.6) percent compared to an expected rate of return of 4.0 percent).
•2021 net mark-to-market gain of $833 million - primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2021 compared to the end of 2020. this was partially offset by various assumption changes and a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (u.s. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 3.6 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 4.2 percent).
sensitivity foreign exchange rate sensitivity me&t operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the u.s. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years. based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our me&t operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2024 cash flow for our me&t operations by approximately $200 million. last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $98 million adverse impact on 2023 cash flow.  we determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. we multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity.
in managing foreign currency risk for our financial products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. since our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies, a 10 percent change in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the u.s. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year.
the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including competitive risk. if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above. in addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the u.s. dollar. in reality, some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen. our primary exposure (excluding competitive risk) is to exchange rate movements in the chinese yuan, australian dollar, euro, british pound and mexican peso.
interest rate sensitivity for our me&t operations, we have the option to use interest rate contracts to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts to fixed-rate debt, and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances.  a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2024 pre-tax earnings of me&t. last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2023 pre-tax earnings.
for our financial products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives and strategies. we have a match-funding policy that addresses the interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate and duration) of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our finance receivable portfolio within a predetermined range on an ongoing basis. in connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the finance receivable portfolio. match funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.
in order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates, financial products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pre-tax earnings. all on-balance sheet positions, including derivative financial instruments, are included in the analysis. the primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities, the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant. an analysis of the december 31, 2023 balance sheet, using these assumptions, estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a minimal impact on 2024 pre-tax earnings.  last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2023 pre-tax earnings.
this analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement, nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate.
non-gaap financial measures we provide the following definitions for the non-gaap financial measures used in this report. these non-gaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies.  management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures.
we believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of five significant items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers. these items consist of (i) restructuring costs related to the divestiture of the company's longwall business, (ii) other restructuring costs, (iii) pension and opeb mark-to-market gains/losses resulting from plan remeasurements, (iv) certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments and (v) goodwill impairment in 2022. we do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the non-gaap measures will provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aid with assessing our period-over-period results. in addition, we provide a calculation of me&t free cash flow as we believe it is an important measure for investors to determine the cash generation available for financing activities including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.
reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable gaap measures are as follows:

supplemental consolidating data we are providing supplemental consolidating data for the purpose of additional analysis. we have grouped the data as follows:
consolidated - caterpillar inc. and its subsidiaries.
machinery, energy & transportation - we define me&t as it is presented in the supplemental data as caterpillar inc. and its subsidiaries, excluding financial products. me&t's information relates to the design, manufacturing and marketing of our products.
financial products - we define financial products as it is presented in the supplemental data as our finance and insurance subsidiaries, primarily caterpillar financial services corporation (cat financial) and cat insurance holdings inc. (insurance services). financial products' information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of caterpillar and other equipment.
consolidating adjustments - eliminations of transactions between me&t and financial products.
the nature of the me&t and financial products businesses is different, especially with regard to the financial position and cash flow items. caterpillar management utilizes this presentation internally to highlight these differences. we believe this presentation will assist readers in understanding our business.
pages 49 to 51 reconcile me&t and financial products to caterpillar inc. consolidated financial information. certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

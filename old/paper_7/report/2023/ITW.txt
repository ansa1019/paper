item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction illinois tool works inc. (the "company" or "itw") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with 84 divisions in 51 countries. as of december 31, 2023, the company employed approximately 45,000 people.
the company's operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets, and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments: automotive oem; food equipment; test & measurement and electronics; welding; polymers & fluids; construction products; and specialty products.
due to the large number of diverse businesses and the company's decentralized operating structure, the company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. instead, the company's corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. these key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.
the itw business model the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the company's core source of value creation. it is the company's competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders. the itw business model is comprised of three unique elements:
•itw's 80/20 front-to-back process is the operating system that is applied in every itw business. initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s, itw has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the company and its customers. through the application of data driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, itw focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the "80") and eliminates cost, complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities (the "20"). 80/20 enables itw businesses to consistently achieve world-class operational excellence in product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance;
•customer-back innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth at itw. the company's unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 80/20 front-to-back process. working from the customer back, itw businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their "80" customers. itw's innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in "80" markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and creating unique solutions to address those needs. these customer insights and learnings drive innovation at itw and have contributed to a portfolio of approximately 19,600 granted and pending patents;
•itw's decentralized, entrepreneurial culture enables itw businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. itw businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the itw business model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers' needs. itw colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the company's strategy and values. as a result, the company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers best-in-class services and solutions adapted to each business' customers and end markets.
enterprise strategy: 2012 - 2023
in late 2012, itw began its strategic framework transitioning the company to fully leverage the unique and powerful set of capabilities and operating practices of the itw business model. the company undertook a complete review of its performance, focusing on its businesses delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, and developing a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations. itw determined that solid and consistent above-market organic growth is the core growth engine to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders.
key initiatives in the company's enterprise strategy included portfolio management, business structure simplification, strategic sourcing and the diligent re-application of itw's proprietary 80/20 front-to-back process.
•as part of the portfolio management initiative, itw exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all itw businesses. this process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated itw divisions.
•business structure simplification was implemented to simplify and scale up itw's operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth. itw now has 84 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation.
•the strategic sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at itw, delivering an average of one percent reduction in spend each year since 2013 and continues to be a key contributor to the company's ongoing enterprise strategy.
•with the initial portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely completed, the company shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth, reapplying the 80/20 front-to-back process to optimize its scaled-up divisions for growth, first, to build a foundation of operational excellence, and second, to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth.
since implementing the company's enterprise strategy in 2012, the company has demonstrated the compelling performance potential of the itw business model and superior 80/20 management, resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the company's operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. at the same time, these 80/20 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns.
our next phase: 2024-2030
in the next phase of the company's evolution, the itw business model and the enterprise strategy framework will be as formidable of a competitive advantage and performance differentiator as it has been over the last decade, if not more so. volatility, risk and the pace of change in the global operating environment will continue to increase, and a decentralized entrepreneurial culture allows the company to be a fast adaptor - to read, react, respond and evolve. the company's ability to consistently execute and invest through the ups and downs of the business cycle is now a defining competitive advantage.
throughout the next phase, the company's focus is to build organic growth into a core itw strength on par with the company's world-class financial performance and operational capabilities. throughout this phase, the company will sustain its foundational strengths built over the past decade, including the high-quality itw business model practice. customer-back innovation (cbi) is the most impactful driver to achieve high-quality organic growth through the cycle by establishing trusted problem solver relationships with key customers to effectively invent solutions that address customers' most critical pain points or tackle the biggest growth opportunities. cbi successes, coupled with underlying market growth and share gains, are how the company intends to achieve its high-quality organic growth.
portfolio discipline the company only operates in industries where it can generate significant, long-term competitive advantage from the itw business model. itw businesses have the right "raw material" in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the itw business model and have significant potential to drive above-market organic growth over the long-term.
the company focuses on high-quality businesses, ensuring it operates in markets with positive long-term macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value itw's differentiated products, services and solutions. itw's portfolio operates in highly diverse end markets and geographies which makes the company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments.
the company routinely evaluates its portfolio to ensure it delivers sustainable differentiation and drives consistent long-term performance. this includes both implementing portfolio refinements and assessing selective high-quality acquisitions to supplement itw's long-term growth potential.

as the company continues to make progress toward its full potential, the company will explore opportunities to reinforce or further expand the long-term organic growth potential of itw through the addition of selective high-quality acquisitions, such as the acquisition of the test & simulation business of mts systems corporation ("mts") from amphenol corporation on december 1, 2021. the operating results of the mts test & simulation business were reported within the company's test & measurement and electronics segment. refer to note 3. acquisitions in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding this acquisition.
80/20 front-to-back practice excellence itw will continue to drive 80/20 front-to-back practice excellence in every division in the company, every day. driving strong operational excellence in the quality of 80/20 front-to-back practice across the company, division by division, will produce further customer-facing performance improvement in a number of divisions and additional structural margin expansion at the enterprise level.

after-tax return on average invested capital the company uses after-tax return on average invested capital ("after-tax roic") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. after-tax roic is not defined under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). after-tax roic is a non-gaap financial measure that the company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company's ability to generate returns from cash invested in its operations and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate after-tax roic. the company defines after-tax roic as operating income after taxes divided by average invested capital, which is annualized when presented in interim periods. operating income after taxes is a non-gaap measure consisting of net income before interest expense and other income (expense), on an after-tax basis, which are excluded as they do not represent returns generated by the company's operations. for comparability, the company also excluded the discrete tax benefit of $20 million in the second quarter of 2023 from net income and the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2023. additionally, for comparability, the company also excluded the discrete tax benefits of $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $51 million in the second quarter of 2022 from net income and the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2022. also, for comparability, the company excluded the discrete tax benefits of $21 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $112 million in the second quarter of 2021 from net income and the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2021. total invested capital represents the net assets of the company, other than cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which do not represent capital investment in the company's operations. the most comparable gaap measure to operating income after taxes is net income. net income to average invested capital and after-tax roic for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were as follows:

as of december 31, 2023, short-term debt included $700 million related to the 3.50% notes due march 1, 2024, which were reclassified from long-term debt to short-term debt in the first quarter of 2023, $661 million related to the 0.25% euro notes due december 5, 2024, which were reclassified from long-term debt to short-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2023, and commercial paper of $464 million. as of december 31, 2022, short-term debt included $535 million related to the 1.25% euro notes due may 22, 2023, which were repaid on the due date, and commercial paper of $1.1 billion.
on may 5, 2023, the company entered into a €1.3 billion euro-denominated credit agreement (the "euro credit agreement") with a termination date of may 3, 2024; provided, however, that the company may extend the termination date by six months on up to two occasions. on may 12, 2023, the company borrowed €1.3 billion of euro term loans under the euro credit agreement. proceeds from the borrowing were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding debt. any loan under the euro credit agreement may not be re-borrowed once repaid, in full or in part, and will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the applicable euribor (adjusted for any statutory reserves) plus 0.75% for the interest period selected by the company of one, three or six months. as of december 31, 2023, the company had €1.3 billion outstanding under the euro credit agreement with an interest rate of 4.59%, which was included in long-term debt as the company intends to exercise its options to extend the termination date.
the company may issue commercial paper to fund general corporate needs, share repurchases, and small and medium-sized acquisitions. during the fourth quarter of 2022, the company entered into a $3.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility with a termination date of october 21, 2027, which is available to provide additional liquidity, including to support the potential issuances of commercial paper. no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2023 or 2022. the maximum outstanding commercial paper balance during 2023 was $1.9 billion, while the average daily balance was $1.0 billion.
as of december 31, 2023, the company had unused capacity of approximately $158 million under international debt facilities. in the ordinary course of business, the company also had approximately $231 million outstanding in guarantees, letters of credit and other similar arrangements with financial institutions as of december 31, 2023. refer to note 11. debt in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for additional details regarding the company's outstanding debt obligations.
total debt to ebitda the company uses the ratio of total debt to ebitda as a measure of its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. ebitda and the ratio of total debt to ebitda are non-gaap financial measures. the company believes that total debt to ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company's long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to ebitda. the ratio of total debt to ebitda represents total debt divided by net income before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis. total debt to ebitda for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:

critical accounting estimates the company has three accounting estimates that it believes are most important to the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. management bases its estimates on historical experience, and in some cases on observable market information. various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the company's critical accounting estimates are as follows:
income taxes- the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. the company's deferred and other tax balances are based on management's interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. income tax expense, assets and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the company's various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions. future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company.
goodwill and intangible assets- the company's business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the company's total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods. the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. on an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists. if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for the difference. in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets, management relies on a number of factors, including business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.
as of december 31, 2023, the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of approximately $5.6 billion allocated to its reporting units. although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets, the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets. in addition, the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time, and in many cases have been able to improve their performance, primarily as a result of the application of the company's 80/20 front-to-back process. the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately $215 million to $1.4 billion, with the average amount equal to $556 million. in all cases, the fair value of the individual reporting unit significantly exceeds its carrying value. fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company's global end markets, impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods.
pension and other postretirement benefits- the company has various company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a number of u.s. employees and many employees outside the u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations. pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant's years of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or termination. important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets, life expectancy, and health care cost trend rates. future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. see note 12. pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the year-end measurement date for the u.s. primary pension plan. the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. in estimating this rate, the company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the u.s. primary pension plan obligation by approximately $24 million. the company estimates the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weighted-average rate. see note 12. pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for information on the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions.
the expected long-term return on plan assets is based on historical and expected long-term returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes. for the u.s. primary pension plan, a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately $4 million.

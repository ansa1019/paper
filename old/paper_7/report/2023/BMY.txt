management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this 2023 form 10-k to enhance the understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
the comparison of 2022 to 2021 results has been omitted from this form 10-k and is incorporated by reference from our form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022 "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" filed on february 14, 2023.
executive summary bristol-myers squibb company is a global biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. refer to the summary of abbreviated terms at the end of this 2023 form 10-k for definitions of capitalized terms used throughout the document.
in 2023, we received approvals for initial and additional indications for the following marketed products in major markets (the u.s., eu and japan), which further expanded our geographical reach in immunology, hematology, oncology, and cardiovascular diseases: (i) u.s. and eu approval of opdivo for treatment of completely resected stage iib and iic melanoma, expanding upon the existing adjuvant treatment for melanoma patients; (ii) fda approval of reblozyl in the first-line setting for the treatment of anemia without previous erythropoiesis stimulating agent use in adult patients with very low- to intermediate-risk mds who may also require red blood cell transfusions, regardless of ring sideroblast status; and eu approval for an additional indication for anemia associated with non-transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia; (iii) approvals in japan and in the eu of opdivo in combination with chemotherapy for the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with resectable nsclc; (iv) approval of camzyos for the treatment of symptomatic obstructive hcm in the eu; (v) approval of breyanzi for the second-line treatment of diffuse large b-cell lymphoma in the eu; (vi) approval for sotyktu for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the eu; and (vii) approval of augtyro (repotrectinib), a next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki), for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic ros1+ non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) in the u.s. we continue expanding our commercial car-t manufacturing network through the fda approval of our devens, ma facility in june 2023.
in january 2024, we acquired mirati, a commercial stage targeted oncology company with a pipeline of commercial, clinical and pre-clinical stage oncology medicines and assets. with the mirati acquisition, we obtained rights to krazati*, a best-in-class inhibitor of krasg12c mutation, approved by the fda as a second-line treatment for patients with nsclc; and mrtx1719, a potential first-in-class mta-cooperative prmt5 inhibitor in phase i development, among others. in addition, during the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into definitive merger agreements to acquire karuna and rayzebio and also entered into strategic collaboration with systimmune. karuna is a biopharmaceutical company driven to discover, develop and deliver transformative medicines for people living with psychiatric and neurological conditions. rayzebio is a clinical-stage radiopharmaceutical therapeutics company with an innovation-leading position in actinium-based radiopharmaceutical therapeutics and a pipeline of potentially first-in-class and best-in-class drug development programs. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 4. acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and other arrangements" for additional information. the goal of the collaboration with systimmune is to co-develop and co-commercialize bl-b01d1, a bispecific topoisomerase inhibitor-based anti-body drug conjugate which targets both egfr and her3 and is currently being evaluated in a phase i clinical trial for metastatic or unresectable nsclc. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 3. alliances" for further information.
the company has the potential to increase its registrational portfolio from six to up to twelve potentially first-in-class/best-in-class assets. in addition to its growing registrational portfolio, the company has more than 25 indication expansion opportunities on the horizon. taken together, this leads to increased depth across the company's therapeutic areas, including oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular and a growing presence in neuroscience.

total revenues                                       $45,006                         $46,159
diluted earnings per share gaap                                                   $3.86                           $2.95

in 2023, our revenues decreased by 2%, primarily due to lower revlimid sales driven by the previously disclosed generic erosion and increase in patients receiving free drug product for revlimid, and to a lesser extent, pomalyst, from the bristol myers squibb patient assistance foundation, partially offset by higher sales of our new product portfolio and in-line products (primarily opdivo). the $0.91 increase in gaap eps in 2023 was primarily driven by the impact of certain specified items, including deferred income tax benefit related to a non-u.s. tax ruling, lower losses on equity investments, amortization of intangible assets, as well as litigation and other settlement income, partially offset by lower revenues and product mix. after adjusting for specified items, non-gaap eps decreased $0.19 primarily as a result of lower revenues and product mix, partially offset by higher royalty and interest income and lower weighted average shares outstanding.
our non-gaap financial measures, including non-gaap earnings and related eps information, are adjusted to exclude specified items that represent certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other items impacting the comparability of financial results. for a detailed listing of all specified items and further information, reconciliations and changes to our non-gaap financial measures refer to "-non-gaap financial measures."
economic and market factors governmental actions our products continue to be subject to increasing pressures across the portfolio from pharmaceutical market access and pricing controls and discounting, changes to tax and importation laws and other restrictions in the u.s., the eu and other regions around the world that result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and smaller populations for whom payers will reimburse, which can negatively impact our results of operations (including intangible asset impairment charges), operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. for example, on august 16, 2022, president biden signed the ira into law which provides for (i) the government to negotiate prices for select high-cost medicare part d (beginning in 2026) and part b drugs (beginning in 2028) that are more than nine years (for small-molecule drugs) or 13 years (for biological products) from their fda approval, (ii) manufacturers to pay a rebate for medicare part b and part d drugs when prices increase faster than inflation beginning in 2022 for part d and 2023 for part b, and (iii) medicare part d redesign which replaces the current part d cgdp and establishes a $2,000 cap for out-of-pocket limits costs for medicare beneficiaries beginning in 2025, with manufacturers being responsible for 10% of costs up to the $2,000 cap and 20% after that cap is reached. in august 2023, the u.s. department of health and human services selected eliquis as one of the first 10 medicines subject to government-set prices beginning in 2026. it is possible that more of our products could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, accelerate revenue erosion prior to expiry of intellectual property protections. in addition, in december 2023, the biden administration released a proposed framework that for the first time proposed that a drug's price can be a factor in determining that the drug is not accessible to the public and therefore that the government could exercise "march-in rights" and license it to a third party to manufacture. a comment period on the proposal ran through february 6, 2024, and we are not able to predict whether a final rule will be adopted along the lines proposed and, if adopted, whether the government would seek to exercise march-in rights for any of our products. other proposals, such as those relating to the calculation of best price as well as potential executive orders focused on drug pricing are still being debated. the effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations.
additionally, in connection with the ira the following changes have been made to u.s. tax laws, including (i) a 15% minimum tax that generally applies to u.s. corporations on adjusted financial statement income beginning in 2023 and (ii) a non-deductible 1% excise tax provision on net stock repurchases, to be applied to repurchases beginning in 2023. we continue to evaluate the impact of the ira legislation on our results of operations and it is possible that these changes may result in a material impact on our business and results of operations. furthermore, countries are expected to make changes to their tax laws and updates to international tax treaties to implement the agreement by the oecd to establish a global minimum tax.
see risk factors on these items included under "part i-item 1a. risk factors-product, industry and operational risks-increased pricing pressure and other restrictions in the u.s. and abroad continue to negatively affect our revenues and profit margins", "-we could lose market exclusivity of a product earlier than expected" and "-changes to tax regulations could negatively impact our earnings."

refer to "-product and pipeline developments" for all of the developments in our marketed products and late-stage pipeline in 2023 and in early 2024.
strategy our principal strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a large pharmaceutical company with the speed, agility and focus on innovation typically found in the biotech industry. our priorities are (i) to continue to renew and diversify our portfolio through launching new medicines, (ii) advancing our early, mid and late-stage pipeline and (iii) executing disciplined business development. as we undergo a period of renewal, our strategy will be focused on driving near-term growth, minimizing the impact of a transition period that follows and delivering growth in the late 2020s by accelerating opportunities that enhance productivity and efficiency, advance our pipeline, and drive strong commercial execution that move our business forward. we remain committed to a strategic business development and maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, growing the dividend and reducing additional debt that will be issued in support of recent transactions.
our focus is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines for patients facing serious diseases in the following five core therapeutic areas: (i) oncology with a priority in certain tumor types, including diversification beyond io; (ii) hematology with opportunities to expand leadership position in multiple myeloma, as well as broaden our portfolio across leukemias, lymphomas and non-malignant hematologic diseases; (iii) immunology with priorities in strengthening presence in dermatology, rheumatology and gastrointestinal disorders, establishing new standards of care in pulmonology and rapidly advance cell therapy into immunology diseases; (iv) cardiovascular diseases with focus on cardiomyopathies, heart failures and thrombotic diseases; and (v) neuroscience with a focus on neuropsychiatry, neurodegenerative and neuroinflammation diseases.
we are working towards expanding our pipeline of registrational assets from six to up to twelve. in addition, we are positioned to support continued innovation and expand treatment options across several different diseases based on our differentiated research platforms. we have a broad portfolio and pipeline when it comes to autologous car-t cell therapies. we have two approved cell therapies against two distinct targets and are continuing to build our leadership in this space. we are expanding manufacturing capacity, exploring innovative technologies such as dual-targeting car-ts and allogenic approaches, advancing multiple next-generation assets including new targets and rapidly expanding into immunology, including lupus and multiple sclerosis. we also have a strong position in the protein degradation field and have been advancing our pipeline with an expansive library of assets with two in registrational trials, an additional five in clinical phase studies and more than fifteen being studied pre-clinically. this growing platform has potential across several diseases and is positioned to deliver approximately four inds each year. together with our proven track record, rapidly advancing pipeline and growth with marketed products, we increased and sustained our r&d productivity enabling us to identify more high-quality candidates and increase their probability of reaching patients in need. specifically, our ambition is to: (i) deliver approximately ten inds per year; (ii) increase success rates from first-in-human trials to approval to approximately 20%; (iii) reduce timelines to achieve a median of 6.5 years from first-in-human trials to approval. our r&d strategy will help ensure we maintain a strong legacy of scientific innovation, bringing first-in class and/or best-in-class treatments to patients at an accelerated speed.
our commercial model has been successful with revenues from our in-line brands and new product portfolio continuing to grow, which demonstrates strong execution of our strategy. we remain focused and well-resourced in our cancer development programs and seek to broaden the use of opdivo in earlier lines of therapy, expand into new tumors, accelerate next wave oncology mechanisms and develop treatment options for refractory oncology patients. we are encouraged that our investigational subcutaneous formulation for opdivo has the potential to bring enhanced benefits to patients into the next decade, with positive registrational data now in-house. we continue to drive adoption of opdivo by expanding into additional indications and tumor types both as a monotherapy and in combination with yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. we are further strengthening our io portfolio with opdualag for the treatment of melanoma and potential expanded opportunities in other indications. we are growing a differentiated nsclc portfolio, which includes the launch of augtyro and includes krazati, (acquired through mirati), which demonstrates a strategic fit into our oncology portfolio. we are also strengthening our neuroscience portfolio with the planned acquisition of karuna. moreover, eliquis continues to grow, leveraging its best in class clinical profile and extensive real world data and remains the number one novel oral anticoagulant in total prescriptions globally. camzyos continues to demonstrate benefits as shared through our long-term follow-up data from two phase iii studies. in immunology, sotyktu is the key growth driver for bms and we continue to make further investments to accelerate the launch through direct to consumer advertising and adding field force support. in addition, our phase iii registrational clinical trials are underway for sotyktu in psa, sle and sjögren's syndrome. we are able to leverage our leading capabilities in hematological malignancies and our robust pipeline to provide opportunities for long-term growth to offset the impact of current and future patent expiries for revlimid and pomalyst. as we look at our cell therapy franchise, we continue to explore new indications with breyanzi to include the treatment of cll, fl and mcl. if indication for cll is approved, it would be the first and only car-t available for this patient population. reblozyl is advancing into new indications with an ongoing registrational trial for chronic anemia associated with myelofibrosis.
the evolution in our operating model, which focuses on maintaining a disciplined approach in marketing, selling and administrative expenses, will enable us to deliver the necessary strategic, financial and operational flexibility to invest in the highest priority opportunities within our portfolio.
our strategy extends well beyond the discovery, development and delivery of transformative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. we understand the future of our employees, our communities, our planet, and our business are inextricably linked. through our environmental, social and governance (esg) strategy, we seek to mobilize our capabilities and resources to positively impact the communities where we live, work, and serve around the world. as we work to transform patients' lives through science, we operate with effective governance, uncompromising quality and compliance, and the highest ethical standards to deliver our mission. these values have been central to who we are, what we do, and how we do it since our company was founded in 1887. we believe that driving long-term business value is at the heart of living our purpose, enabling us to be leaders and difference-makers for generations to come.

united states
•u.s. revenues in 2023 decreased 1% primarily due to lower revlimid sales driven by the previously disclosed generic erosion and an increase in patients receiving free drug product for revlimid, and to a lesser extent, pomalyst, from the bristol myers squibb patient assistance foundation, a separate and independent 501(c)(3) entity to which bms donates product, partially offset by an increase in demand for our in-line products and new product portfolio. average net selling prices remained flat in 2023 compared to 2022.
international
•international revenues in 2023 decreased 6% primarily due to revlimid and eliquis generic erosion, lower average net selling prices, and foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by an increase in demand for opdivo and new product portfolio.
no single country outside the u.s. contributed more than 10% of total revenues in 2023 and 2022. our business is typically not seasonal.

estimated end-user demand pursuant to the sec consent order described under "-sec consent order", we monitor inventory levels on hand in the u.s. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the u.s. in the direct customer distribution channel. we disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to certain limited exceptions. there were none as of december 31, 2023, for our u.s. distribution channels, and september 30, 2023, for our non-u.s. distribution channels.
in the u.s., we generally determine our months on hand estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 85% of total gross sales of u.s. products for the year ended december 31, 2023. factors that may influence our estimates include generic erosion, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. in addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes.
camzyos is only available through a restricted program called the camzyos rems program. product distribution is limited to rems certified pharmacies, and enrolled pharmacies must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive camzyos. revlimid and pomalyst are distributed in the u.s. primarily through contracted pharmacies under the lenalidomide rems and pomalyst rems programs, respectively. these are proprietary risk-management distribution programs tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of revlimid and pomalyst. internationally, revlimid and imnovid are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local authorities' specifications to provide for the products' safe and appropriate distribution and use. these programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies.
our non-u.s. businesses have significantly more direct customers. information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. we limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we can influence demand. when this information does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of methodologies to estimate such data, including using historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. given the difficulties inherent in estimating third-party demand information, we evaluate our methodologies to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand on an ongoing basis and make changes as necessary. factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. as such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-u.s. business for the year ended december 31, 2023 is not available prior to the filing of this 2023 form 10-k. we will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand for the current quarter, subject to certain limited exceptions, in our next quarterly report on form 10-q.

effective tax rate excluding specified items            14.7    %                       15.3    %
the effective tax rate decreased from 17.7% to 4.7% primarily due to the impact of specified items summarized in the following "-non-gaap financial measures" section. the most significant impacts included (i) a $656 million deferred income tax benefit following the receipt of a non-u.s. tax ruling regarding the deductibility of a statutory impairment of subsidiary investments in 2023, (ii) $123 million higher tax benefits attributed to foreign currency on net operating loss and other carryforwards in 2023, (iii) a $193 million valuation allowance reversal related to unrealized equity investment losses in 2023, (iv) a $72 million tax benefit resulting from a revaluation of the basis of intangible and other assets internally transferred to streamline our legal entity structure after the celgene acquisition in 2022, and (v) a $225 million tax reserve release related to the 2009 mead johnson split-off transaction in 2022.
excluding the impact of specified items, the effective tax rate decreased from 15.3% to 14.7% primarily due to (i) revised guidance regarding deductibility of certain research and development expenses which reduced income taxes attributable to 2023 pre-tax income by approximately $160 million and was the primary reason for a $240 million reduction to previously estimated income taxes for 2022 upon finalization of the u.s. federal income tax return, (ii) a favorable jurisdictional earnings mix which was partially offset by (iii) a $144 million impact of changes in the puerto rico tax decree that eliminated a previously creditable excise tax and (iv) $208 million of lower income tax reserve reversals. income tax reserve reversals included $89 million related to the celgene's 2009-2011 irs audits in 2023 and $297 million for tax positions that were effectively settled for the bms 2008 to 2012 tax years (excluding mead johnson related amounts that were specified) and the lapse of statute of limitations for the celgene 2012 to 2016 tax years in 2022. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 7. income taxes" for additional information.
in december 2022, the eu member states voted unanimously to adopt a directive implementing the pillar two (global minimum tax) rules giving member states until december 31, 2023 to implement the directive into national legislation. certain jurisdictions in which we operate, under the oecd/g20 inclusive framework, have enacted legislation that adopts a subset of such rules effective january 1, 2024, with the remaining rules becoming effective january 1, 2025. these rules and associated legislative changes may significantly impact our tax provision and results of operations. the implementation of pillar two is currently expected to increase our effective tax rate excluding specified items by approximately 1% in 2024.
non-gaap financial measures our non-gaap financial measures, such as non-gaap earnings and related eps information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. these items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future operating results. these items are excluded from non-gaap earnings and related eps information because the company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the company's business nor reflect the company's underlying business performance. similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods, including (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, including product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue and will recur until the intangible assets are fully amortized, (ii) unwind of inventory purchase price adjustments, (iii) acquisition and integration expenses, (iv) restructuring costs, (v) accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, (vi) costs of acquiring a priority review voucher, (vii) divestiture gains or losses, (viii) stock compensation resulting from acquisition-related equity awards, (ix) pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges, (x) equity investment and contingent value rights fair value adjustments (including fair value adjustments attributed to limited partnership equity method investments), (xi) income resulting from the change in control of the nimbus therapeutics tyk2 program and (xii) amortization of fair value adjustments of debt acquired from celgene in our 2019 exchange offer, among other items. deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. certain other significant tax items are also excluded such as the impact resulting from a non-u.s. tax ruling regarding the deductibility of a statutory impairment of subsidiary investments, release of income tax reserves related to the mead johnson split-off transaction and internal transfers of intangible and other assets to streamline our legal entity structure subsequent to the celgene acquisition. we also provide international revenues for our priority products excluding the impact of foreign exchange. we calculate foreign exchange impacts by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior period average currency rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures are included in exhibit 99.1 to our form 8-k filed on february 2, 2024 and are incorporated herein by reference.
non-gaap information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors' overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. we encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

liquidity and capital resources we regularly assess our anticipated working capital needs, debt and leverage ratio levels, debt maturities, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions in order to maximize shareholder return, efficiently finance our ongoing operations and maintain flexibility for future strategic transactions. we also regularly evaluate our capital structure to ensure financial risks, adequate liquidity access and lower cost of capital are efficiently managed, which may lead to the issuance of additional debt securities, the repurchase of debt securities prior to maturity or the issuance or repurchase of common stock.
we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities together with cash generated from operations in the next few years, and, if required, from the issuance of commercial paper, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for at least the next few years, including dividends, capital expenditures, milestone payments, working capital, income taxes, restructuring initiatives, repurchase of common stock, and debt maturities of approximately $10.3 billion through 2028, as well as any debt repurchases through redemptions or tender offers. as of december 31, 2023, our net debt position decreased by $2.9 billion primarily driven by $13.9 billion of cash provided by operations partially offset by $9.9 billion of dividend payments and common stock repurchases and $1.2 billion of capital expenditures.
in february 2024, we entered into a $10.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility to provide bridge financing for the planned acquisitions of karuna and rayzebio. this facility would be drawn only if these acquisitions close prior to our planned issuance of debt securities and, if drawn, would be repaid following the issuance of such securities. no amounts were outstanding as of february 13, 2024. for more information on planned acquisitions, refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 4. acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and other arrangements".
in 2023, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $4.5 billion of debt. we used the net proceeds for the acquisition of mirati in january 2024 and general corporate purposes. in addition, $3.9 billion of debt matured and was repaid. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data -note 10. financing arrangements" for further information.
we have a share repurchase program, authorized by our board of directors, allowing for repurchases of bms common stock shares, effected in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in compliance with rule 10b-18 under the exchange act, including through rule 10b5-1 trading plans. the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares nor does it have a specific expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. in 2023, we repurchased approximately 87 million shares of our common stock for $5.2 billion, including approximately 70 million shares for $4.0 billion through our asr agreements. in december 2023, the board of directors approved an increase of $3.0 billion to the share repurchase authorization for bms's common stock. the remaining share repurchase capacity under the bms share repurchase program was $5.0 billion as of december 31, 2023. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 17. equity" for additional information.
dividend payments were $4.7 billion in 2023 and $4.6 billion in 2022. dividend paid per common share was $0.57 during each quarter of 2023. dividends are authorized on a quarterly basis by our board of directors.
under our commercial paper program, we may issue a maximum of $7.0 billion unsecured notes that have maturities of not more than 365 days from the date of issuance. there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2023.
as of december 31, 2023, we had a five-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in january 2028, which is extendable annually by one year with the consent of the lenders. in january 2024, we extended the credit facility to january 2029. additionally, in february 2024, we entered into a $2.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility. the facilities provide for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants and may be used to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings. no borrowings were outstanding under any revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2023 or 2022.
our investment portfolio includes marketable debt securities, which are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. our investment policy establishes limits on the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. the policy also requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial institutions that meet high credit quality standards. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 10. financing arrangements" for further information.
capital expenditures annual capital expenditures were approximately $1.1 billion in 2023 and 2022, $970 million in 2021 and are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion in 2024 and 2025. we continue to make capital expenditures in connection with the expansion of our cell therapy and other manufacturing capabilities, research and development and other facility-related activities.
contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. information regarding our obligations relating to debt, income taxes and lease arrangements are provided in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 1. accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards", "-note 10. financing arrangements", "-note 7. income taxes" and "-note 14. leases", respectively.
we are committed to an aggregate $20.0 billion of potential contingent future research and development milestone payments to third parties for in-licensing, asset acquisitions and development programs including early-stage milestones of $6.5 billion (milestones achieved through phase iii clinical studies) and late-stage milestones of $13.5 billion (milestones achieved post phase iii clinical studies). payments generally are due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. certain agreements also provide for sales-based milestones aggregating to $14.6 billion that we would be obligated to pay upon achievement of certain sales levels in addition to royalties. we also have certain manufacturing, development and commercialization obligations in connection with alliance arrangements. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of these obligations. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 3. alliances" and "-note 4. acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and other arrangements" for further information.
we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our financial condition or results of operations.
credit ratings in december 2023, following our announcements to acquire karuna and rayzebio, standard & poor's downgraded bms's long-term credit rating to a from a+ (with a stable long-term credit outlook). there were no changes to our short-term standard & poor credit rating (a1). the downgrade to long-term credit ratings reflects standard & poor's anticipation of a higher debt leverage following the announced acquisitions, partially offset by improvements in business strengths. in february 2024, moody's confirmed bms's long-term (a2) and short-term (prime-1) ratings (with a negative long-term credit outlook).
collectively, the current long-term credit ratings reflect the agencies' opinion that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. the short-term credit ratings reflect the agencies' opinion that we have good to extremely strong capacity for timely repayment. any credit rating downgrade may affect the interest rate of any debt we may incur, the fair market value of existing debt and our ability to access the capital markets generally.
cash flows the following is a discussion of cash flow activities:
year ended december 31, dollars in millions                              2023   2022
cash flow provided by/(used in):
operating activities                     $13,860                           $13,066
investing activities                     (2,295)                           (1,062)
financing activities                     (9,416)                          (16,962)
operating activities cash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements from all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in our results of operations. as a result, changes in cash from operating activities reflect the timing of cash collections from customers and alliance partners; payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; customer discounts and rebates; and tax payments in the ordinary course of business.
the $794 million increase in cash flow provided by operating activities compared to 2022 resulted from $1.1 billion of lower u.s. income tax payments, primarily due to revised guidance regarding deductibility of certain research and development expenses, and $900 million of higher non-customer collections, primarily due to royalties, interest, litigation and other settlements. these impacts were partially offset by $900 million of lower net customer collections (net of rebates and discounts) and $300 million of higher payments, primarily due to additional inventory requirements.
investing activities cash requirements from investing activities include cash used for acquisitions, manufacturing and facility-related capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities with original maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase, proceeds from business divestitures (including royalties), the sale and maturity of marketable securities, sale of equity investments, as well as upfront and contingent milestones payments from licensing arrangements.
the $1.2 billion increase in cash flow used in investing activities compared to 2022 resulted from $3.9 billion of changes in the amount of marketable debt securities held and $396 million of lower divestiture proceeds, partially offset by the acquisition of turning point ($3.2 billion net of cash acquired) in 2022.
financing activities cash requirements from financing activities include cash used to pay dividends, repurchase common stock and repay long-term debt and other borrowings, as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of long-term debt and other borrowings.
the $7.5 billion decrease in cash used in financing activities compared to 2022 resulted from $5.8 billion of changes in net debt position, primarily due to the $4.5 billion issuance of debt in connection with the acquisition of mirati and lower debt maturities of $871 million, and $2.8 billion of lower share repurchases, partially offset by $957 million of lower proceeds from stock option exercises.
recently issued accounting standards for recently issued accounting standards, refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 1. accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards."
sec consent order as previously disclosed, on august 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the sec, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. the settlement was reached through a consent, a copy of which was attached as exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on form 10-q for the period ended september 30, 2004.
under the terms of the consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. we also agreed in the consent to certain measures that we have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the sec; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process.
we have established a company-wide policy concerning our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the consent, which includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the consent. these procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. in addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis.
we maintain dsas with our u.s. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of our gross u.s. revenues. under the current terms of the dsas, our wholesaler customers provide us with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. the three largest wholesalers currently account for approximately 85% of our gross u.s. revenues. the inventory information received from our wholesalers, together with our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. we estimate months on hand product inventory levels for our u.s. business's wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. in contrast, our non-u.s. business has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units.
we believe the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the consent.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. our critical accounting policies are those that significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates.
revenue recognition our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates. revenue is recognized following a five-step model: (i) identify the customer contract; (ii) identify the contract's performance obligation; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation; and (v) recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied. revenue is also reduced for gtn sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgment after considering legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g. medicare or medicaid), current contract prices under applicable programs, unbilled claims and processing time lags and inventory levels in the distribution channel. estimates are assessed each period and adjusted as required to revise information or actual experience.
the following categories of gtn adjustments involve significant estimates, judgments and information obtained from external sources. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 2. revenue" for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of gtn sales adjustments.
charge-backs and cash discounts our u.s. business participates in programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the u.s. department of defense and the u.s. department of veterans affairs, and other parties, including covered entities under the 340b program, whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. these entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower program price and the wholesalers then charge us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower program price. accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed charge-back claims attributable to a sale (typically within a two to four week time lag).
in the u.s. and certain other countries, customers are offered cash discounts as an incentive for prompt payment, generally approximating 2% of the invoiced sales price. accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of cash discount at the time of sale and the discount is typically taken by the customer within one month.
medicaid and medicare rebates our u.s. business participates in state government medicaid programs and other qualifying federal and state government programs requiring discounts and rebates to participating state and local government entities. all discounts and rebates provided through these programs are included in our medicaid rebate accrual. medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in managed medicaid plans. the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates is presented as a liability.
rebates and discounts are offered to managed healthcare organizations in the u.s. managing prescription drug programs and medicare advantage prescription drug plans covering the medicare part d drug benefit. we also pay a 70% point of service discount to the cms when the medicare part d beneficiaries are in the coverage gap. the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.
other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments other gtn sales adjustments include sales returns and all other programs based on applicable laws and regulations for individual non-u.s. countries as well as rebates offered to managed healthcare organizations in the u.s. to a lesser extent. the non-u.s. programs include several different pricing schemes such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing schemes and pricing claw-backs that are based on sales of individual companies or an aggregation of all companies participating in a specific market. the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.
estimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and lower demand following the loss of market exclusivity. estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line, similar therapeutic area and/or similar distribution model and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand. the estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability.
use of information from external sources information from external sources is used to estimate gtn adjustments. our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers is based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. the inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals.
we have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. we use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. we also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information.
acquisition and intangible assets valuations we make certain judgments to determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or as business combinations. if it is determined that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the transaction is treated as an acquisition of assets. we evaluate the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities and assets. if the assets in a transaction include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the transaction is treated as an acquisition of a business.
we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date. excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. estimating fair value requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions.
in transactions accounted for as acquisitions of assets, no goodwill is recorded and contingent consideration, such as payments upon achievement of various developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones, generally is not recognized at the acquisition date. in an asset acquisition, upfront payments allocated to iprd projects at the acquisition date are expensed unless there is an alternative future use. in addition, product development milestones are expensed upon achievement.
we have identifiable intangible assets that are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. generally, we engage an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. the fair value of these assets is estimated using discounted cash flow models. these models required the use of the following significant estimates and assumptions among others:
•identification of product candidates with sufficient substance requiring separate recognition;
•estimates of revenues and operating profits related to commercial products or product candidates;
•eligible patients, pricing and market share used in estimating future revenues;
•probability of success for unapproved product candidates and additional indications for commercial products;
•resources required to complete the development and approval of product candidates;
•timing of regulatory approvals and exclusivity;
•appropriate discount rate by products;
•market participant income tax rates; and
•allocation of expected synergies to products.
we believe the fair value used to record intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions considering the facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date.
impairment and amortization of long-lived assets, including intangible assets long-lived assets include intangible assets and property, plant and equipment and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable or at least annually for iprd. intangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products or iprd. these assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include changes in competitive landscape, earlier than expected loss of market exclusivity, pricing reductions, adverse regulatory changes or clinical study results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval for initial or follow on indications and unanticipated development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies resulting from cost savings and avoidance, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. the complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation. if the carrying value of long-lived assets exceeds its fair value, then the asset is written-down to its fair value. expectations of future cash flows are subject to change based upon the near and long-term production volumes and margins generated by the asset as well as any potential alternative future use. the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets is subjective and requires significant judgment regarding patent lives, future plans and external market factors. long-lived assets are also periodically reviewed for changes in facts or circumstances resulting in a reduction to the estimated useful life of the asset, requiring the acceleration of depreciation or amortization. impairment charges included in cost of products sold and research and development expense were $136 million in 2023, $101 million in 2022 and $1.2 billion in 2021. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 15. goodwill and other intangible assets" for further discussion and analysis of these impairment charges.
income taxes valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. the assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives. adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. our deferred tax assets were $7.3 billion at december 31, 2023 (net of valuation allowance of $764 million) and $4.1 billion at december 31, 2022 (net of valuation allowance of $873 million).
the u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards were $420 million at december 31, 2023. these carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and are subject to limitations under section 382 of the internal revenue code. the net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2024. the foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2024 (certain amounts have unlimited lives).
liabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known.
for discussions on income taxes, refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 1. accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards-income taxes" and "-note 7. income taxes."
contingencies in the normal course of business, we are subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, contractual claims and tax matters. we recognize accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. these estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates.
for discussions on contingencies, refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 1. accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards-contingencies," "-note 7. income taxes" and "-note 20. legal proceedings and contingencies."
product and pipeline developments our r&d programs are managed on a portfolio basis from early discovery through late-stage development and include a balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support future growth. our late stage r&d programs in phase iii development include both investigational compounds for initial indications and additional indications or formulations for marketed products. spending on these programs represents approximately 46% of our annual r&d expenses in the last three years. opdivo was the only investigational compound or marketed product that represented approximately 10% of our r&d expenses in the last three years. our late-stage development programs could potentially have an impact on our revenue and earnings within the next few years if regulatory approvals are obtained and products are successfully commercialized. the following are the late-stage new indication developments in our marketed products, as well as developments in our late-stage pipeline through february 2, 2024:
product        indication        date        developments opdivo                        bladder                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             december 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ono, our alliance partner for opdivo in japan, announced that it has submitted a supplemental application of opdivo intravenous infusion, a human anti-human pd-1 monoclonal antibody in japan, to expand its use for the treatment of unresectable urothelial carcinoma, for a partial change in approved items of the manufacturing and marketing approval. the application is based on the results from the sub-study of the phase iii checkmate -901 trial.
december 2023                 announced that the fda accepted the sbla for opdivo in combination with cisplatin-based chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for adult patients with unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. the application is based on results from the phase iii checkmate -901 trial. the fda granted the application priority review status and assigned a pdufa goal date of april 5, 2024.
october 2023                  announced that the ema validated its type ii variation application of opdivo in combination with cisplatin-based chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for adult patients with unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. the application is based on results from the phase iii checkmate -901 trial. application validation confirms the submission is complete and begins the ema's centralized review procedure.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of kkr & co. inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. in addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" and "risk factors." actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
business environment our asset management and insurance businesses are affected by the various market and economic conditions of the various countries and regions in which we operate. market and economic conditions are expected to continue to have a substantial impact on our financial condition, results of operations and our business in various ways that we are unable to control, including our ability to make new investments, the valuations of the investments we manage, the amount of investment proceeds we realize when we exit our investments, the timing for such realization activity, our ability to fundraise or to sell our various investment and insurance products and services, and the level of our capital markets activities, as discussed in the "risk factors" section of this report.
in 2023, the united states continued to experience economic growth despite monetary policy tightening by the federal reserve board in response to high inflation. in europe, the european union experienced growth in 2023, albeit at a weaker rate as compared to 2022, and the european central bank also raised interest rates in response to high inflation. in asia, its two largest economies experienced different economic conditions. in japan, its economy grew in 2023 at a higher rate than in prior periods, and japan's economy experienced an uptick in inflation. in china, its economy grew in 2023 but at a lower-than-expected rate due to various headwinds, including concerns about the levels of certain government debt and its property sector. the u.s. federal reserve board has signaled that they would likely no longer raise interest rates and would likely ease monetary policy in 2024, assuming inflation were to return close to its 2% target. the european central bank stated its intention to keep its key rates at current levels until its inflation would also return to its 2% target. the bank of japan stated its intention to continue to maintain low interest rates until its inflation rate increases more meaningfully. the people's bank of china pledged its support of the chinese economy with moderate interest rate cuts and increased bank lending. in addition, slowing growth in certain real estate sectors with excess near-term supply has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the valuations of assets in such sectors in the near-term.
several key economic indicators in the united states and in other countries and regions in which we operate include:

other trends, uncertainties and risks related to our business please refer to the "risk factors" section of this report for important additional detail regarding risks, uncertainties and other conditions that could have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on our businesses, including the impact of market and economic conditions on valuations of investments. these risks, uncertainties and other conditions should be read in conjunction with this business environment section and the entire risk factor section. in particular, see "risks related to our investment activities-our valuation methodologies for certain assets can be subjective, and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such subjective methodologies is uncertain and may never be realized" and "risks related to our investment activities-various market and economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments; which may make them volatile and we may not be able to realize them at such values."
basis of accounting and key financial measures under gaap we manage our business using certain financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our operating activities. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). see note 2 " summary of significant accounting policies" in our financial statements and "critical accounting policies and estimates" contained in this section below. our key segment and non-gaap financial measures and operating metrics are discussed below.
adoption of new accounting standard effective january 1, 2023, we adopted new accounting guidance for insurance and reinsurance companies that issue long-duration contracts ("ldti") with retrospective application to february 1, 2021, the date of the 2021 ga acquisition. for a more detailed discussion of the adoption of the ldti, see note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" in our financial statements included in this report.
key segment and non-gaap performance measures the following key segment and non-gaap performance measures are used by management in making operational and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing the performance of kkr's business. they include certain financial measures that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with gaap. these performance measures as described below are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) between kkr & co. inc. and holders of exchangeable securities and as such represent the entire kkr business in total. in addition, these performance measures are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of certain investment funds and collateralized financing entities ("cfes") that kkr manages.
we believe that providing these segment and non-gaap performance measures on a supplemental basis to our gaap results is helpful to stockholders in assessing the overall performance of kkr's business. these non-gaap measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, where applicable are included under "-analysis of non-gaap balance sheet measures-reconciliations to gaap measures."
modification of segment information and non-gaap measures in connection with the adoption of ldti (see note 2 in our financial statements), kkr reevaluated the manner in which it makes operational and resource deployment decisions and assesses the overall performance of kkr's business. effective with the three months ended march 31, 2023, the items detailed below have changed with respect to the preparation of the reports used by kkr's chief operating decision makers. as a result, kkr has modified the presentation of its segment financial information with retrospective application to all prior periods presented. the most significant changes between kkr's current segment presentation and our previous segment presentation are as follows:
(1)implementation of the accounting changes as a result of ldti within kkr's insurance segment. kkr excludes (i) changes in the fair value of market risk benefits and other policy liabilities and the associated derivatives, (ii) fees attributed to guaranteed benefits, and (iii) losses at contract issue on payout annuities from the insurance segment operating earnings. these items are excluded from insurance segment operating earnings and we believe these items do not reflect the underlying performance of this business;
(2)global atlantic book value includes the impact of ldti except for the impacts recorded in other comprehensive income, which are excluded from book value; and
(3)reporting on a pre-tax basis insurance segment operating earnings (which was previously reported on an after-tax basis).
we believe these adjustments and changes reflect how management evaluates the insurance business. we believe this approach enhances the transparency and visibility of the drivers of global atlantic's underlying operating performance.
fee related earnings, asset management segment operating earnings, and total asset management segment revenues are not impacted by ldti or the adjustments and changes noted above. therefore, these non-gaap measures have not been recast for the historical periods.
as discussed in note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" in our financial statements, our historical consolidated gaap financial results have been recast to reflect the adoption of ldti on a full retrospective basis. certain of our historical non-gaap measures have been recast to reflect the adoption of ldti along with the adjustments and changes noted above.
after-tax distributable earnings after-tax distributable earnings is a non-gaap performance measure of kkr's earnings, which is derived from kkr's reported segment results. after-tax distributable earnings is used to assess the performance of kkr's business operations and measures the earnings potentially available for distribution to its equity holders or reinvestment into its business. after-tax distributable earnings is equal to distributable operating earnings less interest expense, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and income taxes on operating earnings. series c mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends have been excluded from after-tax distributable earnings (for the periods when this preferred stock was still outstanding), because the definition of adjusted shares used to calculate after-tax distributable earnings per adjusted share assumes that all shares of series c mandatory convertible preferred stock have been converted to shares of common stock of kkr & co. inc. income taxes on operating earnings represents the (i) amount of income taxes that would be paid assuming that all pre-tax asset management distributable earnings were allocated to kkr & co. inc. and taxed at the same effective rate, which assumes that all securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of kkr & co. inc. were exchanged and (ii) the amount of income taxes on insurance segment operating earnings. income taxes on insurance segment operating earnings represent the total current and deferred tax expense or benefit on income before taxes adjusted to eliminate the impact of the tax expense or benefit associated with the non-operating adjustments. income taxes on operating earnings includes the benefit of tax deductions arising from equity-based compensation, which reduces operating income taxes during the period. equity based compensation expense is excluded from after-tax distributable earnings, because (i) kkr believes that the cost of equity awards granted to employees does not contribute to the earnings potentially available for distributions to its equity holders or reinvestment into its business and (ii) excluding this expense makes kkr's reporting metric more comparable to the corresponding metric presented by other publicly traded companies in kkr's industry, which kkr believes enhances an investor's ability to compare kkr's performance to these other companies. if tax deductions from equity-based compensation were to be excluded from income taxes on operating earnings, kkr's after-tax distributable earnings would be lower and kkr's effective tax rate would appear to be higher, even though a lower amount of income taxes would have actually been paid or payable during the period. kkr separately discloses the amount of tax deduction from equity-based compensation for the period reported and the effect of its inclusion in after-tax distributable earnings for the period. kkr makes these adjustments when calculating after-tax distributable earnings in order to more accurately reflect the net realized earnings that are expected to be or become available for distribution to kkr's equity holders or reinvestment into kkr's business. however, after-tax distributable earnings does not represent and is not used to calculate actual dividends under kkr's dividend policy, which is a fixed amount per period, and after-tax distributable earnings should not be viewed as a measure of kkr's liquidity.
book value book value is a non-gaap performance measure of the net assets of kkr and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized value of kkr's net assets presented on a basis that (i) excludes the net assets that are allocated to investors in kkr's investment funds and other noncontrolling interest holders, (ii) includes the net assets that are attributable to certain securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of kkr & co. inc., and (iii) includes kkr's ownership of the net assets of global atlantic. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the net assets of kkr excluding those net assets that are allocated to investors in kkr's investment funds and other noncontrolling interest holders. kkr's book value includes the net impact of kkr's tax assets and liabilities as calculated under gaap. series c mandatory convertible preferred stock had been included in book value, because the definition of adjusted shares used to calculate book value per adjusted share assumes that all shares of series c mandatory convertible preferred stock had, prior to its redemption, been converted to shares of common stock of kkr & co. inc. to calculate global atlantic book value and to make it more comparable with the corresponding metric presented by other publicly traded companies in global atlantic's industry, global atlantic book value excludes (i) accumulated other comprehensive income and (ii) accumulated change in fair value of reinsurance balances and related assets, net of income tax.
distributable operating earnings distributable operating earnings is a non-gaap performance measure that kkr believes is useful to stockholders as it provides a supplemental measure of our operating performance without taking into account items that kkr does not believe arise from or relate directly to kkr's operations. distributable operating earnings excludes: (i) equity-based compensation charges, (ii) amortization of acquired intangibles, (iii) strategic corporate-related charges and (iv) non-recurring items, if any. strategic corporate-related charges arise from corporate actions and consist primarily of (i) impairments, (ii) transaction costs from strategic acquisitions, and (iii) depreciation on real estate that kkr owns and occupies. inter-segment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. these transactions include (i) management fees earned by kkr as the investment adviser for global atlantic insurance companies and (ii) interest income and expense based on lending arrangements where one or more kkr subsidiaries borrow from a global atlantic insurance subsidiary. inter-segment transactions are recorded by each segment based on the definitive documents that contain arms' length terms and comply with applicable regulatory requirements. distributable operating earnings represents operating earnings of kkr's asset management and insurance segments.
asset management segment operating earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the asset management segment and is comprised of: (i) fee related earnings, (ii) realized performance income, (iii) realized performance income compensation, (iv) realized investment income, and (v) realized investment income compensation. asset management segment operating earnings excludes the impact of: (i) unrealized gains (losses) on investments, (ii) unrealized carried interest, and (iii) related unrealized carried interest compensation. management fees earned by kkr as the adviser, manager or sponsor for its investment funds, vehicles and accounts, including its global atlantic insurance companies, are included in asset management segment operating earnings.
insurance segment operating earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the insurance segment. this measure is presented before income taxes and is comprised of: (i) net investment income, (ii) net cost of insurance, (iii) general, administrative, and other expenses, and (iv) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. the non-operating adjustments made to derive insurance segment operating earnings excludes the impact of: (i) investment gains (losses) which include realized gains (losses) related to asset/liability matching investments strategies and unrealized investment gains (losses) and (ii) non-operating changes in policy liabilities and derivatives which includes (a) changes in the fair value of market risk benefits and other policy liabilities measured at fair value and related benefit payments, (b) fees attributed to guaranteed benefits, (c) derivatives used to manage the risks associated with policy liabilities, and (d) losses at contract issuance on payout annuities. insurance segment operating earnings includes (i) realized gains and losses not related to asset/liability matching investments strategies and (ii) the investment management costs that are earned by kkr as the investment adviser of the global atlantic insurance companies.
fee related earnings fee related earnings is a performance measure used to assess the asset management segment's generation of profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and are not dependent on future realization events. kkr believes this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the profitability of kkr's fee generating asset management and capital markets businesses and other recurring revenue streams. fre equals (i) management fees, including fees paid by the insurance segment to the asset management segment and fees paid by certain insurance co-investment vehicles, (ii) transaction and monitoring fees, net and (iii) fee related performance revenues, less (x) fee related compensation, and (y) other operating expenses.
fee related performance revenues refers to the realized portion of incentive fees from certain aum that has an indefinite term and for which there is no immediate requirement to return invested capital to investors upon the realization of investments. fee related performance revenues consists of performance fees (i) to be received from our investment funds, vehicles and accounts on a recurring basis, and (ii) that are not dependent on a realization event involving investments held by the investment fund, vehicle or account.
fee related compensation refers to the compensation expense, excluding equity-based compensation, paid from (i) management fees, (ii) transaction and monitoring fees, net, and (iii) fee related performance revenues.
other operating expenses represents the sum of (i) occupancy and related charges and (ii) other operating expenses.
total asset management segment revenues total asset management segment revenues is a performance measure that represents the realized revenues of the asset management segment (which excludes unrealized carried interest and unrealized net gains (losses) on investments) and is the sum of (i) management fees, (ii) transaction and monitoring fees, net, (iii) fee related performance revenues, (iv) realized performance income, and (v) realized investment income. kkr believes that this performance measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the realized revenues generated by kkr's asset management segment.
other terms and capital metrics adjusted shares adjusted shares represents shares of common stock of kkr & co. inc. outstanding under gaap adjusted to include (i) for any reporting period prior to the redemption of the series c mandatory convertible preferred stock in september 2023, the number of shares of common stock of kkr & co. inc. assumed to be issuable upon conversion of the series c mandatory convertible preferred stock and (ii) certain securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of kkr & co. inc. weighted average adjusted shares is used in the calculation of after-tax distributable earnings per adjusted share, and adjusted shares is used in the calculation of book value per adjusted share.
assets under management assets under management represent the assets managed, advised or sponsored by kkr from which kkr is entitled to receive management fees or performance income (currently or upon a future event), general partner capital, and assets managed, advised or sponsored by our strategic bdc partnership and the hedge fund and other managers in which kkr holds an ownership interest. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital raising activities of kkr and its hedge fund and other managers and the overall activity in their investment funds and other managed or sponsored capital. kkr calculates the amount of aum as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of kkr's investment funds and certain co-investment vehicles; (ii) uncalled capital commitments from these funds, including uncalled capital commitments from which kkr is currently not earning management fees or performance income; (iii) the asset value of the global atlantic insurance companies; (iv) the par value of outstanding clos; (v) kkr's pro rata portion of the aum of hedge fund and other managers in which kkr holds an ownership interest; (vi) all of the aum of kkr's strategic bdc partnership; (vii) the acquisition cost of invested assets of certain non-us real estate investment trusts and (viii) the value of other assets managed or sponsored by kkr. the pro rata portion of the aum of hedge fund and other managers is calculated based on kkr's percentage ownership interest in such entities multiplied by such entity's respective aum. kkr's definition of aum (i) is not based on any definition of aum that may be set forth in the governing documents of the investment funds, vehicles, accounts or other entities whose capital is included in this definition, (ii) includes assets for which kkr does not act as an investment adviser, and (iii) is not calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions.
capital invested capital invested is the aggregate amount of capital invested by (i) kkr's investment funds and global atlantic insurance companies, (ii) kkr's principal activities business line as a co-investment, if any, alongside kkr's investment funds, and (iii) kkr's principal activities business line in connection with a syndication transaction conducted by kkr's capital markets business line, if any. capital invested is used as a measure of investment activity at kkr during a given period. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides a measure of capital deployment across kkr's business lines. capital invested includes investments made using investment financing arrangements like credit facilities, as applicable. capital invested excludes (i) investments in certain leveraged credit strategies, (ii) capital invested by kkr's principal activities business line that is not a co-investment alongside kkr's investment funds, and (iii) capital invested by kkr's principal activities business line that is not invested in connection with a syndication transaction by kkr's capital markets business line. capital syndicated by kkr's capital markets business line to third parties other than kkr's investment funds or principal activities business line is not included in capital invested.
fee paying aum fee paying aum represents only the aum from which kkr is entitled to receive management fees. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which kkr earns management fees. fpaum is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate kkr's and its hedge fund and bdc partnership management fees and differs from aum in the following respects: (i) assets and commitments from which kkr is not entitled to receive a management fee are excluded (e.g., assets and commitments with respect to which it is entitled to receive only performance income or is otherwise not currently entitled to receive a management fee) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments.
uncalled commitments uncalled commitments is the aggregate amount of unfunded capital commitments that kkr's investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments, and the amount of uncalled commitments is not reduced by capital invested using borrowings under an investment fund's subscription facility until capital is called from our fund investors. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to kkr's investment funds and carry paying co-investment vehicles to make future investments. uncalled commitments are not reduced for investments completed using fund-level investment financing arrangements or investments we have committed to make but remain unfunded at the reporting date.

fees and other total fees and other for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily as a result of an increase in management fees and a decrease in fee credits, which were partially offset by a lower level of transaction fees.
for a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected our transaction fees during the period, see "-analysis of asset management segment operating results."
the increase in management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned on new capital raised over the past twelve months at asia pacific infrastructure investors ii, global impact fund ii, ascendant fund, and next generation technology growth fund iii. the increase was partially offset by (i) a lower level of management fees from americas fund xii due to a step-down in the management fee rate in 2023 and a decrease in invested capital, (ii) management fees earned on new capital raised for north america fund xiii in the first quarter of 2022 that was retroactive to the start of the fund's investment period, and (iii) a lower level of management fees from asian fund iii due to a decrease in its fee base, invested capital, from the sale of investments. there were no management fees that were retroactive to the start of the fund's investment period for the year ended december 31, 2023 for north america fund xiii.
management fees due from consolidated investment funds and other vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under gaap. however, because these amounts are funded by, and earned from, noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under gaap, kkr's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds and other vehicles is increased by the amount of fees that are eliminated. accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to kkr would be unchanged if such investment funds and other vehicles were not consolidated. for a more detailed discussion on the factors that affect our management fees during the period, see "-analysis of asset management segment operating results."
fee credits decreased compared to the prior period primarily as a result of a lower level of transaction fees in our private equity, real assets and credit and liquid strategies business lines in the current period. fee credits owed to consolidated investment funds and other vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under gaap. however, because these amounts are owed to noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under gaap, kkr's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds is decreased by the amount of fee credits that are eliminated. accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to kkr would be unchanged if such investment funds and other vehicles were not consolidated. transaction and monitoring fees earned from kkr portfolio companies are not eliminated upon consolidation because those fees are earned from companies which are not consolidated. furthermore, transaction fees earned in our capital markets business are not shared with fund investors. accordingly, certain transaction fees are reflected in our revenues without a corresponding fee credit.
capital allocation-based income (loss)
capital allocation-based income (loss) for the year ended december 31, 2023 was positive primarily due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments in many of our unconsolidated carry-earning investment funds, most notably americas fund xii, asian fund iii, and global infrastructure investors iii. capital allocation-based income (loss) for the year ended december 31, 2022 was negative primarily due to the net depreciation of the underlying investments in many of our carry-earning investment funds, most notably americas fund xii, asian fund ii, and asian fund iii.
kkr generally calculates the carried interest that would be due to kkr for each investment fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of the reporting date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. since the fair value of the underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to the amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either (a) positive performance, resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to kkr to be less than the amount previously recognized, resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner. in each case, it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and to make the required positive or negative adjustments.
investment income (loss) - asset management net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2023
the net gains from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2023 were comprised of net realized losses of $(776.5) million and net unrealized gains of $3,801.9 million.
investment gains and losses relating to our general partner capital interest in our unconsolidated funds are not reflected in our discussion and analysis of net gains (losses) from investment activities. our economics associated with these gains and losses are reflected in capital allocation-based income (loss) as described above.
realized gains and losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2023, net realized losses related primarily to (i) a realized loss on our investment in genesiscare pty ltd. (healthcare sector), (ii) realized losses from the distribution of certain assets to third-party investors in certain of our consolidated energy funds, predominantly allocated to noncontrolling interests based on their ownership in our investment funds, (iii) a realized loss on our investment in envision healthcare corporation (healthcare sector), and (iv) realized losses on alternative credit investments, hilding anders international ab (consumer products sector) and chembulk group (transportation sector), predominantly allocated to noncontrolling interests based on their ownership in our investment funds. partially offsetting these realized losses were realized gains primarily relating to (i) realizations on certain foreign exchange forward contracts, and (ii) the sale of our investment in knowbe4, inc. (nasdaq: knbe) and flutter entertainment plc (lon: fltr).
unrealized gains and losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2023, net unrealized gains were driven primarily by (i) mark-to-market gains primarily relating to bridgebio pharma, inc. (nasdaq: bbio), exact holding b.v. (technology sector), and usi, inc. (financial services sector), (ii) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses relating to the realization activity described above, and (iii) certain investments held in our consolidated clos. these unrealized gains were partially offset by mark-to-market losses primarily relating to (i) petvet care centers, llc (healthcare sector), (ii) certain foreign exchange forward contracts, and (iii) debt obligations of our consolidated clos.
the factors that affect each investment strategy vary depending on the nature of the asset class and the valuation methodology employed. for the year ended december 31, 2023 net unrealized gains were primarily generated in the following asset classes:
•traditional private equity and core private equity, which were primarily impacted by (i) the positive returns of global equity markets and the related increase of market multiples used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of level iii investments, and (ii) overall positive operating performance of its portfolio companies;
•credit, which were primarily impacted by positive performance of our clos and by the tightening of the credit spreads during the year; and
•infrastructure, which primarily benefited from the positive operating performance of certain infrastructure assets and to a lesser extent by the positive returns of global equity markets and the related increase of market multiples used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of level iii investments.
partially offsetting the gains in the asset classes above, there were unrealized losses generated in the real estate investments, which, notwithstanding the positive operating performance at certain properties, were negatively impacted by capitalization rates widening further in 2023. see "risk factors" and "-business environment" for more information about the factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuation.
net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2022
the net losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 were comprised of net realized gains of $1,298.5 million and net unrealized losses of $(2,964.0) million.
realized gains and losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2022, net realized gains related primarily to (i) the sale of our investment in fiserv, inc. (nasdaq: fisv), (ii) realizations on certain foreign exchange forward contracts, and (iii) the sale of real estate investments held in certain consolidated opportunistic real estate equity funds. partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses primarily relating to (i) various investments held in our consolidated alternative credit funds, (ii) a realized loss on magneti marelli ck holdings (industrials sector) held in certain consolidated funds and (iii) realized losses from the sales of revolving credit facilities.
unrealized gains and losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2022, net unrealized losses were driven primarily by mark-to-market losses from (i) certain debt investments held in our consolidated clos and consolidated alternative credit funds, (ii) outsystems holdings s.a. (technology sector) held in certain consolidated funds and (iii) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above. these unrealized losses were partially offset by mark-to-market gains related to (i) energy investments held in certain consolidated energy funds, (ii) usi, inc., and (iii) erm worldwide group limited (services sector).
for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's realized investment income, see "-analysis of asset management segment operating results." for additional information about net gains (losses) from investment activities, see note 4 "net gains (losses) from investment activities - asset management" in our financial statements.
dividend income during the year ended december 31, 2023, dividend income was primarily from (i) our open-ended core infrastructure fund, diversified core infrastructure fund, (ii) our consolidated opportunistic real estate equity funds, and (iii) cegid group s.a. (technology sector) and atlantic aviation fbo inc. (infrastructure: transportation sector), both held in our consolidated core vehicles. during the year ended december 31, 2022, dividend income was primarily from (i) our consolidated core plus and opportunistic real estate equity funds and (ii) our investment in exact group b.v. held in our consolidated core vehicles.
significant dividends from portfolio companies and consolidated funds are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's dividend income, see "-analysis of asset management segment operating results."
interest income the increase in interest income during the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 was primarily due to (i) the impact of closing clos that are consolidated subsequent to december 31, 2022, (ii) higher interest rates on floating rate investments held in consolidated clos and our consolidated private credit funds, and (iii) a higher level of interest income from certain of our consolidated private credit funds, related to an increase in the amount of capital deployed. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's interest income, see "-analysis of asset management segment operating results."
interest expense the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 was primarily due to (i) the increase in the amount of borrowings outstanding from certain consolidated funds and other vehicles, (ii) the impact of closing clos that are consolidated subsequent to december 31, 2022, (iii) higher interest rates on floating rate debt obligations held in consolidated clos, and (iv) the impact of issuances of kkr senior notes after december 31, 2022. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's interest expense, see "-analysis of non-gaap performance measures."
expenses - asset management compensation and benefits the increase in compensation and benefits during the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 was primarily due to accrued carried interest compensation in the current period compared to the reversal of previously recognized carried interest compensation in the prior period. partially offsetting the increase is a lower level of accrued discretionary cash compensation resulting from a lower level of asset management segment revenues in the current period.
the number of equity-based compensation awards granted in 2023 is higher than in 2022 which is expected to result in a higher equity-based compensation expense in future periods. additional equity grants made in 2024 or forfeitures of existing equity grants during 2024 would increase and decrease the amount of equity-based compensation expense to be recorded in the future, respectively.
general, administrative and other the increase in general, administrative and other during the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 was primarily due to (i) a higher level of expenses from our consolidated investment funds and clos due to the impact of consolidating certain new funds and clos subsequent to december 31, 2022 and (ii) a higher level of information technology and other administrative costs in connection with the overall growth of the firm. the increase was partially offset by (i) a lower level of expenses reimbursable by our unconsolidated investment funds and (ii) a lower level of corporate travel costs and placement fees.
in periods of increased fundraising and to the extent that we use third parties to assist in our capital raising efforts, our general, administrative and other are expected to increase accordingly.
consolidated results of operations (gaap basis) - insurance assumption review the assumptions on which reserves, deferred revenue and expenses are based are intended to represent an estimation of the benefits that are expected to be payable to, and fees or premiums that are expected to be collectible from, policyholders in future periods. global atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves, deferred revenue and expenses and the assumptions underlying those items at least annually, usually in the third quarter. as global atlantic analyzes its assumptions, to the extent global atlantic chooses to update one or more of those assumptions, there may be an "unlocking" impact. generally, favorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required a reduction in reserves, or in deferred revenue liabilities, and unfavorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required an increase in reserves or in deferred revenue liabilities, or a reduction in deferred expenses.
the following table reflects the impact on net income before taxes and to insurance segment adjusted operating earnings from global atlantic's assumption review:

for the year ended december 31, 2023, the net unfavorable impact on income before taxes was primarily due to (i) an increase in option cost assumptions for indexed products (net of the impact of reducing caps), (ii) an increase in mortality assumptions related to certain annuity products, and (iii) a decrease in expected surrenders on income annuities and life insurance products. these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a favorable impact of lower expected surrenders on accumulation annuities. for the year ended december 31, 2022, the net favorable impact to income before taxes was primarily due to lower utilization of fixed-indexed annuity income benefits and higher variable annuity fees, offset by lower life and annuity surrender rates. the assumption review impact on adjustments to derive insurance segment adjusted operating earnings reflects the net impact of market risk benefits and other policy liabilities measured at fair value.

net premiums net premiums increased for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in initial premiums assumed from reinsurance transactions with life contingencies during the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase was partially offset by higher retrocessions to third party reinsurers during the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022. the initial premiums on assumed reinsurance were offset by a comparable increase in policy reserves reported within net policy benefits and claims (as discussed below).
net investment income net investment income increased for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily due to (i) increased average assets under management due to growth in assets in global atlantic's institutional market channel as a result of new reinsurance transactions and individual market channel sales and (ii) growth in portfolio yields due to higher market interest rates and the benefit in 2023 from rotating into higher yielding assets during 2022.

net gains on derivative instruments the decrease in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest payable for the year ended december 31, 2023 was primarily driven by the change in fair value of the underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio, which is primarily comprised of fixed maturity securities (designated as trading for accounting purposes), mortgage and other loan receivables, and other investments. the underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio increased in value during the year ended december 31, 2023 and decreased during the year ended december 31, 2022 due to market interest rates ending 2023 relatively flat (having generally increased during 2023, and then decreased at the end of fourth quarter 2023) as compared to a significant increase during the year ended december 31, 2022.
the decrease in the fair value of equity futures was driven primarily by the performance of equity markets. global atlantic purchases equity futures primarily to hedge the market risk in its variable annuity products which are accounted for in policy benefits and claims. the majority of global atlantic's equity futures are based on the s&p 500 index, which increased during the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to a decrease during the year ended december 31, 2022, resulting in respectively, a loss, and a gain, on equity futures contracts in the respective periods.
the increase in the fair value of interest rate and foreign exchange contracts was primarily driven by volatile market interest rates over the course of the year ended december 31, 2023, ending relatively flat for the year in general, as compared to a significant increase in market interest rates during the year ended december 31, 2022, resulting in a loss on interest rate contracts in both periods, respectively.
the increase in the fair value of equity index options was primarily driven by the performance of the indexes upon which call options are based. global atlantic purchases equity index options to hedge the market risk of embedded derivatives in indexed universal life and fixed-indexed annuity products (the change in which is accounted for in net policy benefits and claims). the majority of global atlantic's equity index call options are based on the s&p 500 index, which increased during the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to a decrease during the year ended december 31, 2022.
the increase in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest receivable was primarily due to a narrowing of credit spreads during the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to a widening of credit spreads during the year ended december 31, 2022.

the increase in net other investment gains for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to net other investment losses for the year ended december 31, 2022, were primarily due to (i) an increase in unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities classified as trading which was primarily due to market interest rates ending the year relatively flat after being volatile during the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to a significant increase in market interest rates during the year ended december 31, 2022, (ii) a decrease in realized losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity debt securities which was primarily due to a decrease in portfolio rotation activity during the year ended december 31, 2023, and (iii) an increase in gains from other investments, primarily due to a net decrease in realized losses from the disposition of renewable energy investments in the current and prior year.
offsetting these increases in net other investment gains were (i) an increase in unrealized losses on investments accounted under a fair-value option, (ii) an increase in unrealized losses on real estate investments at fair-value under investment company accounting due to higher interest and capitalization rates during the year ended december 31, 2023 and (iii) a decrease in realized gains on investments not supporting asset-liability matching strategies.
expenses net policy benefits and claims net policy benefits and claims increased for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily due to (i) an increase in the value of embedded derivatives in global atlantic's indexed universal life and fixed indexed annuity products, as a result of higher equity market returns (as discussed above under "-consolidated results of operations (gaap basis)-revenues-net investment-related gains (losses)," global atlantic purchases equity index options in order to hedge this risk, the fair value changes of which are accounted for in gains on derivative instruments, and generally offsetting the change in embedded derivative fair value reported in net policy benefits and claims), (ii) an increase in losses on market risk benefits due to market interest rates generally ending the year relatively flat after being volatile during the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to a significant increase in market interest rates during the year ended december 31, 2022, (iii) an increase in net flows from both individual and institutional market channel sales, (iv) higher average funding costs due to higher crediting rates and the ordinary-course run-off of older business originated in a lower interest rate environment, (v) higher initial reserves assumed related to new reinsurance transactions with life contingencies in the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022, and (vi) an increase in unfavorable assumption review impacts as discussed above.
offsetting these increases was a decrease in variable annuity market risk benefit liabilities primarily due to higher equity market returns for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022.
amortization of policy acquisition costs amortization of policy acquisition costs increased for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily due to growth in global atlantic's individual market and institutional market channels.
interest expense interest expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily due to (i) a net increase in total debt outstanding, and (ii) an increase in interest expense on floating rate debt (i.e., global atlantic's fixed-to-floating swaps on its fixed rate debt) due to higher market interest rates during portions of the year ended december 31, 2023.
insurance expenses insurance expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily due to increased commission expenses and reinsurance transaction expense allowances.
general, administrative and other general, administrative and other increased for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily due to increased employee compensation and benefits related expenses.

income tax expense (benefit)
income tax expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily due to asset management net operating income in the current period as compared to a net operating loss in the prior period driven by asset management capital allocation-based losses. for a discussion of factors that impacted kkr's tax provision, see note 18 "income taxes" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2023 relates primarily to net income (loss) attributable to: (i) exchangeable securities representing ownership interests in kkr group partnership, (ii) third party limited partner interests in consolidated investment funds and (iii) interests that third-party investors hold in global atlantic. net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2023 was primarily related to net gains from investment activities at our consolidated investment funds and positive income allocable to interests that third party investors hold in global atlantic.
net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. inc.
net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. inc. for the year ended december 31, 2023 was positive as compared to a net loss in the prior period. net income attributable to kkr & co. inc. for the year ended december 31, 2023 was primarily driven by capital allocation-based income and net gains from investment activities in asset management in the period. the net loss attributable to kkr & co. inc. for the year ended december 31, 2022 was driven by capital allocation-based losses and net losses from investment activities in asset management.

fees and other total fees and other for the year ended december 31, 2022 decreased compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of a lower level of transaction fees, which was primarily offset by an increase in management fees.
for a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected our transaction fees during the period, see "-analysis of asset management segment operating results."
the increase in management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from north america fund xiii, global infrastructure investors iv and european fund vi. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from european fund v and americas fund xii as a result of entering their post-investment periods and, consequently, we now earn fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and at a lower fee rate.
management fees due from consolidated investment funds and other vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under gaap. however, because these amounts are funded by, and earned from, noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under gaap, kkr's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds and other vehicles is increased by the amount of fees that are eliminated. accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to kkr would be unchanged if such investment funds and other vehicles were not consolidated. for a more detailed discussion on the factors that affect our management fees during the period, see "-analysis of asset management segment operating results."
fee credits increased compared to the prior period as a result of a higher level of transaction fees from infrastructure transaction fee-generating investments in our real asset business line. fee credits owed to consolidated investment funds are eliminated upon consolidation under gaap. however, because these amounts are owed to noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under gaap, kkr's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds is decreased by the amount of fee credits that are eliminated. accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to kkr would be unchanged if such investment funds and other vehicles were not consolidated. transaction and monitoring fees earned from kkr portfolio companies are not eliminated upon consolidation because those fees are earned from companies which are not consolidated. furthermore, transaction fees earned in our capital markets business are not shared with fund investors. accordingly, certain transaction fees are reflected in our revenues without a corresponding fee credit.
capital allocation-based income (loss)
capital allocation-based income (loss) for the year ended december 31, 2022 was negative primarily due to the net depreciation of the underlying investments in many of our carry-earning investment funds, most notably americas fund xii, asian fund ii, and asian fund iii. capital allocation-based income (loss) for the year ended december 31, 2021 was positive primarily due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments at our carry earning investment funds, most notably americas fund xii, asian fund iii, and north america fund xi.
kkr generally calculates the carried interest that would be due to kkr for each investment fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of the reporting date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. since the fair value of the underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to the amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either (a) positive performance, resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to kkr to be less than the amount previously recognized, resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner. in each case, it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and to make the required positive or negative adjustments.
investment income (loss) - asset management net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2022
the net losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 were comprised of net realized gains of $1,298.5 million and net unrealized losses of $(2,964.0) million.
investment gains and losses relating to our general partner capital interest in our unconsolidated funds are not reflected in our discussion and analysis of net gains (losses) from investment activities. our economics associated with these gains and losses are reflected in capital allocation-based income (loss) as described above.
realized gains and losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2022, net realized gains related primarily to (i) the sale of our investment in fiserv, inc., (ii) realizations on certain foreign exchange forward contracts, and (iii) the sale of real estate investments held in certain consolidated opportunistic real estate equity funds. partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses primarily relating to (i) various investments held in our consolidated alternative credit funds, (ii) a realized loss on magneti marelli ck holdings held in certain consolidated funds and (iii) realized losses from the sales of revolving credit facilities.
unrealized gains and losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2022, net unrealized losses were driven primarily by mark-to-market losses from (i) investments held in our consolidated clos and in certain consolidated alternative credit funds, (ii) outsystems holdings s.a. held in certain consolidated funds and (iii) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above. these unrealized losses were partially offset by mark-to-market gains related to (i) investments held in certain consolidated energy funds, (ii) usi, inc., and (iii) erm worldwide group limited.
the extent and the factors that affect each investment strategy vary depending on the nature of the asset class and the valuation methodology employed. for the year ended december 31, 2022 net unrealized losses were primarily generated in the following asset classes:
•traditional private equity (excluding core private equity), which was primarily impacted by (i) the negative returns of global equity markets and the related reduction of market multiples used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of level iii investments, and (ii) the negative impact of higher interest rates and a higher market risk premium in 2022 on discount rates used in the discounted cash flow methodology for the valuation of level iii investments;
•credit, which were primarily impacted by the widening of the credit spreads observed in the credit markets in 2022; and
•real estate, which, notwithstanding the positive operating performance of certain properties, was negatively impacted by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above and the capitalization rates widening in the fourth quarter of 2022.
partially offsetting the losses in the asset classes above, there were the unrealized gains generated in the following asset classes:
•infrastructure and energy, which generally benefited from (i) higher oil and gas prices and (ii) the positive operating performance of certain infrastructure assets; and
•core private equity, which generally benefited from the positive operating performance of its portfolio companies.
see "risk factors" and "-business environment" for more information about the factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuation.
net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2021
the net gains from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2021 were comprised of net realized gains of $2,382.2 million and net unrealized gains of $5,338.7 million.
realized gains and losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2021, net realized gains related primarily to the sales of investments held by kkr and certain consolidated funds, the most significant of which were in fanduel inc. (technology sector), mr. cooper group inc. (nasdaq: coop), and darktrace limited (lse: dark). partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses, the most significant of which were realized losses from various investments held in our consolidated credit funds and realized losses on certain hedging instruments.
unrealized gains and losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2021, net unrealized gains related primarily to mark-to-market gains from investments held by kkr and certain consolidated funds, the most significant of which were petvet care centers, llc, heartland dental llc (healthcare sector) and outsystems holdings s.a. partially offsetting these unrealized gains were unrealized losses, the most significant of which were (i) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above and (ii) an unrealized loss on bridgebio pharma, inc.
for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's realized investment income, see "-analysis of asset management segment operating results" and note 4 "net gains (losses) from investment activities - asset management" in our financial statements.
dividend income during the year ended december 31, 2022, dividend income was primarily from (i) our consolidated core plus and opportunistic real estate equity funds and (ii) our investment in exact group b.v. held in our consolidated core vehicles. during the year ended december 31, 2021, dividend income was primarily from (i) our consolidated real estate funds, (ii) our investment in viridor limited (infrastructure: energy and energy transition sector), and (iii) our investment in arnott's biscuits limited (consumer products sector).
significant dividends from portfolio companies and consolidated funds are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's dividend income, see "-analysis of asset management segment operating results."
interest income the increase in interest income during the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 was primarily due to the (i) impact of closing additional clos that were consolidated during 2022 and higher interest rates on assets held in consolidated clos and (ii) a higher level of interest income from investments held in certain of our consolidated alternative credit funds, primarily related to an increase in the amount of capital deployed and higher interest rates. partially offsetting these increases was the deconsolidation of kref in the fourth quarter of 2021. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's interest income, see "-analysis of asset management segment operating results."
interest expense the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 was primarily due to (i) an increase in the amount of borrowings outstanding from consolidated funds and other vehicles, (ii) the impact of closing additional clos that were consolidated during 2022 and higher interest rates on debt obligations held in consolidated clos, and (iii) the impact of issuances of our notes after december 31, 2021. partially offsetting these increases was the deconsolidation of kref in the fourth quarter of 2021. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's interest expense, see "-analysis of non-gaap performance measures."
expenses - asset management compensation and benefits the decrease in compensation and benefits during the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 was primarily due to the reversal of previously recognized accrued carried interest, partially offset by (i) higher equity-based compensation charges and (ii) a higher level of discretionary cash compensation resulting from a higher level of segment fee related revenue and realized performance income in the current period.
general, administrative and other the increase in general, administrative and other during the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 was primarily due to a higher level of (i) expenses at our consolidated funds and investment vehicles, (ii) strategic corporate transaction-related charges, (iii) professional fees, information technology and other administrative costs in connection with the growth of the firm, and (iv) travel related expenses as a result of a return of travel activity to pre- covid-19 pandemic levels.
in periods of significant fundraising and to the extent that we use third parties to assist in our capital raising efforts, our general, administrative and other are expected to increase accordingly. similarly, our general, administrative and other expenses are expected to increase as a result of increased levels of professional and other fees incurred as part of due diligence related to strategic acquisitions and new product development.
consolidated results of operations (gaap basis) - insurance for the year-ended december 31, 2021, the results of global atlantic's insurance operations included in our consolidated results of operations are from the acquisition date, february 1, 2021, through december 31, 2021.
assumption review the assumptions on which reserves, deferred revenue and expenses are based are intended to represent an estimation of the benefits that are expected to be payable to, and fees or premiums that are expected to be collectible from, policyholders in future periods. global atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves, deferred revenue and expenses and the assumptions underlying those items at least annually, usually in the third quarter. as global atlantic analyzes its assumptions, to the extent global atlantic chooses to update one or more of those assumptions, there may be an "unlocking" impact. generally, favorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required a reduction in reserves, or in deferred revenue liabilities, and unfavorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required an increase in reserves or in deferred revenue liabilities, or a reduction in deferred expenses.
the following table reflects the impact on net income before taxes and to insurance segment adjusted operating earnings from global atlantic's assumption review:

for the year ended december 31, 2022, the net favorable unlocking impact on income before taxes was primarily due to lower utilization of fixed-indexed annuity income benefits and higher variable annuity fees, offset by lower life and annuity surrender rates. for the year ended december 31, 2021, the net favorable unlocking impact to income before taxes was primarily due to lower utilization of fixed-indexed annuity income benefits and lower annuity and long-term care claims, offset by higher activation of variable annuity income benefits. the unlocking of assumptions used in the calculation of market risk benefits and other policy reserves accounted for at fair value, which are excluded from the definition of insurance segment adjusted operating earnings, are reflected in the line item "assumption review impact on adjustments to derive insurance segment adjusted operating earnings."

net premiums net premiums decreased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to lower initial premiums related to fewer reinsurance transactions with life contingencies assumed during the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was partially offset by lower retrocessions to third party reinsurers during the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. the initial premiums on assumed reinsurance were offset by a comparable increase in policy reserves reported within net policy benefits and claims (as discussed below).
policy fees policy fees increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the 2021 ga acquisition on february 1, 2021.
net investment income net investment income increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) higher yields on floating-rate investments due to higher market interest rates, (ii) rotation into higher yielding assets, (iii) increased average assets under management due to growth in assets in global atlantic's institutional market channel as a result of new reinsurance transactions and individual market channel sales, and (iv) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the 2021 ga acquisition having occurred on february 1, 2021.

net gains on derivative instruments the increase in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest payable for the year ended december 31, 2022 was primarily driven by the change in fair value of the underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio, which is primarily comprised of fixed maturity securities (designated as trading for accounting purposes), mortgage and other loan receivables, and other investments. the underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio declined in value in the current period primarily due to an increase in market interest rates and wider credit spreads.
the increase in the fair value of equity futures was driven primarily by the performance of equity markets. global atlantic purchases equity futures primarily to hedge the market risk in global atlantic's variable annuity products which are accounted for in net policy benefits and claims. the majority of global atlantic's equity futures are based on the s&p 500 index, which decreased during the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to an increase during the year ended december 31, 2021, resulting in, respectively, a gain and a loss on equity futures contracts in the respective periods.
the decrease in the fair value of equity index options was primarily driven by the performance of the indexes upon which call options are based. global atlantic purchases equity index options to hedge the market risk of embedded derivatives in indexed universal life and fixed-indexed annuity products (the change in which is accounted for in net policy benefits and claims). the majority of global atlantic's equity index call options are based on the s&p 500 index, which decreased during the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the increase during the year ended december 31, 2021.
the decrease in the fair value of interest rate and foreign exchange contracts was primarily driven by an increase in market interest rates during both the year ended december 31, 2022 and the prior financial reporting period, resulting in a loss on interest rate contracts.
the decrease in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest receivable was primarily due to widening of credit spreads during the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the tightening of credit spreads in the year ended december 31, 2021.

the increase in net other investment losses for the year ended december 31, 2022 were primarily due to (i) an increase in unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities classified as trading was primarily due to an increase in interest rates and widening credit spreads in the current period, (ii) a decrease in realized gains on investments not supporting asset-liability matching strategies primarily due to the non-recurrence of a gain from the disposition of origis usa, llc (infrastructure: energy and energy transition sector) in the prior financial reporting period, (iii) the increase in realized losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity debt securities primarily due to portfolio rotation in a higher interest rate environment, (iv) an increase in credit loss allowances on mortgage and other loan receivables in the current period primarily due to an increase in credit risk of global atlantic's loan portfolio, offset in part by the recognition of an initial credit loan loss allowance upon the adoption of the current expected credit loss accounting standard concurrent with the 2021 ga acquisition in the prior financial reporting period, and (v) realized losses on renewable energy investments in the current period.
offsetting these losses were realized gains on funds withheld at interest payable portfolio.
other income other income increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the prior financial reporting period primarily due to one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the 2021 ga acquisition having occurred on february 1, 2021.
expenses net policy benefits and claims net policy benefits and claims decreased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) an increase in gains on market risk benefit liabilities due to a higher increase in interest rates during the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, (ii) lower initial reserves assumed related to fewer new reinsurance transactions with life contingencies in the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, and (iii) a decrease in the value of embedded derivatives in global atlantic's interest sensitive life and fixed indexed annuity products, as a result of lower equity market returns (as discussed above under "-consolidated results of operations (gaap basis)-revenues-net gains on derivatives instruments," global atlantic purchases equity index options in order to hedge this risk, the fair value changes of which are accounted for in gains on derivative instruments, and generally offsetting the change in embedded derivative fair value reported in net policy benefits and claims). this decrease was offset by (i) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the 2021 ga acquisition having occurred on february 1, 2021, (ii) an increase in net flows from both individual and institutional market channel sales, (iii) an increase in the market risk benefit liability due to lower equity market returns, (iv) higher funding costs on new business, and (v) favorable experience related to the assumption review described above under "-consolidated results of operations (gaap basis) - insurance-assumption review."
amortization of policy acquisition costs amortization of policy acquisition costs increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) a decrease in the net benefit (that is, a reduction to expense) from the amortization of the net negative insurance intangibles recognized as part of purchase accounting of the 2021 ga acquisition, as the underlying business runs off, and (ii) growth in global atlantic's individual market channel.
interest expense interest expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) a net increase in debt outstanding, including a draw on global atlantic's revolving credit facility in the quarter ended march 31, 2022, (ii) an increase in interest expense on floating rate debt (global atlantic's revolving facility and fixed-to-floating swaps on global atlantic's fixed rate debt) due to higher market rates, and (iii) the impact of one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the 2021 ga acquisition having occurred on february 1, 2021.
insurance expenses insurance expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the 2021 ga acquisition having occurred on february 1, 2021, (ii) increased commission expense related to increased sales in global atlantic's individual market and increased reinsurance transactions, and (iii) increased reinsurance ceding expense allowances paid for policy administration services as a result of an increase in reinsurance transactions.
general, administrative and other general, administrative and other increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the 2021 ga acquisition having occurred on february 1, 2021, (ii) increased employee compensation and benefits related expenses, (iii) increased professional service fees, and (iv) increased third-party administrator ("tpa") policy servicing fees, all due to growth of the business.

the increase in private equity management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned on new capital raised over the past twelve months at global impact fund ii, ascendant fund, and next generation technology growth fund iii. this increase was partially offset by (i) a lower level of management fees from americas fund xii due to a step-down in the management fee rate in 2023 and a decrease in invested capital, (ii) management fees earned on new capital raised for north america fund xiii in the first quarter of 2022 that were retroactive to the start of the fund's investment period, and (iii) a lower level of management fees from asian fund iii due to a decrease in its fee base, which had invested capital reduced from the sale of investments. there were no management fees that were retroactive to the start of the fund's investment period for the year ended december 31, 2023 for north america fund xiii. during the fourth quarter of 2023, approximately $14.9 million of management fees were earned on new capital raised that is retroactive to the start of the relevant fund's investment period.
the increase in real assets management fees was primarily attributable to (i) management fees earned from asia pacific infrastructure investors ii for the full year 2023, which entered its investment period in the third quarter of 2022, (ii) a higher level of management fees earned from global atlantic due to an increase in their assets being managed by our asset management segment, and (iii) management fees earned from diversified core infrastructure fund due to an increase in its fee base, due to higher capital inflows and investment appreciation year over year. this increase was partially offset by a lower level of management fees from our first asia pacific infrastructure investors fund in the current year as a result of entering its post-investment period in the third quarter of 2022 and, consequently, management fees being earned on invested capital rather than committed capital. during the fourth quarter of 2023, approximately $4.7 million of management fees were earned on new capital raised that is retroactive to the start of the relevant fund's investment period.
the increase in credit and liquid strategies management fees was primarily attributable to (i) a higher level of management fees earned from global atlantic due to an increase in assets being managed by our asset management segment, (ii) a higher level of management fees earned from marshall wace, and (iii) the issuance of various u.s. and european clos over the last twelve months. the increase was partially offset by a lower level of management fees from certain sig funds primarily due to (i) a decrease in its fee base from the sale of investments, and (ii) certain sig funds which no longer pay management fees as a result of an agreement to waive such fees.

our private equity, real assets and credit and liquid strategies business lines earn transaction and monitoring fees from portfolio companies, and under the terms of the management agreements with certain of our investment funds, we are required to share all or a portion of such fees with our fund investors. for most of our investment funds, transaction and monitoring fees are credited against fund management fees up to 100% of the amount of the transaction and monitoring fees attributable to that investment fund, which results in a decrease of our monitoring and transaction fees. additionally, transaction fees are generally not earned with respect to energy and real estate investments. our capital markets business line earns transaction fees, which are generally not shared with fund investors.
the decrease in transaction and monitoring fees, net is primarily due to a lower level of transaction fees earned in our capital markets business line. the decrease in capital markets transaction fees was primarily due to a decrease in the size of capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to the year ended december 31, 2022. overall, we completed 239 capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2023, of which 45 represented equity offerings and 194 represented debt offerings, as compared to 240 transactions for the year ended december 31, 2022, of which 29 represented equity offerings and 211 represented debt offerings. we earn fees in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. while each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this business line is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we earn for similar transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes.
our capital markets fees are generated in connection with activity involving our private equity, real assets and credit funds as well as from third-party companies. for the year ended december 31, 2023, approximately 13% of our transaction fees in our capital markets business line were earned from unaffiliated third parties as compared to approximately 14% for the year ended december 31, 2022. our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from north america, europe, and the asia-pacific region. for the year ended december 31, 2023, approximately 39% of our transaction fees were generated outside of north america as compared to approximately 46% for the year ended december 31, 2022. our capital markets business line is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads, and volatility. our capital markets business line does not generate monitoring fees.
transaction and monitoring fees, net were lower for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year across our private equity, real assets and credit and liquid strategies business lines primarily due to the decrease in transaction activity resulting in a decline in the level of capital invested year over year. see "-analysis of asset management segment operating results-capital invested" for more information about capital invested by business line.

fee related performance revenues represent performance fees that are (i) expected to be received from our investment funds, vehicles and accounts on a recurring basis, and (ii) not dependent on a realization event involving investments held by the investment fund, vehicle or account.
these performance fees are primarily earned from fsk in our credit and liquid strategies business line and kkr property partners americas ("kppa") (our open-ended core plus real estate fund), krest, kref, and kjrm in our real assets business line.
fee related performance revenues were higher for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior period primarily due to a higher level of performance revenues earned from fsk in the current year. for the year ended december 31, 2023, there were no performance revenues earned from kppa partially offsetting the increase in performance revenues from fsk.
fee related compensation the increase in fee related compensation for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a higher level of compensation recorded in connection with the higher level of revenues included within fee related earnings.
other operating expenses the increase in other operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a higher level of information technology, occupancy, and other administrative costs in connection with the overall growth of the firm, partially offset by a lower level of corporate travel costs and placement fees.
fee related earnings the increase in fee related earnings for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior period is primarily due to a higher level of management fees from our private equity, real assets, and credit and liquid strategies business lines, partially offset by a lower level of transaction and monitoring fees, net, and a higher level of fee related compensation and other operating expenses, as described above.

we expect to realize at least $500.0 million of realized carried interest and realized investment income (loss) in the first half of 2024 from transactions that are pending or closed after december 31, 2023. some of these transactions are not complete, and are subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions, including regulatory approvals; therefore, there can be no assurance if or when such transactions will be completed. in addition, we may realize gains or losses based on transactions or other events that occur after the date of filing this report, which could impact, positively or negatively, the total amount of our realized performance income from carried interest and realized investment income (loss). therefore, our actual realized carried interest and realized investment income for the first half of 2024 may be materially higher or lower than $500.0 million.
realized investment income compensation the decrease in realized investment income compensation for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior period is primarily due to a lower level of compensation recorded in connection with the lower level of realized investment income.

fpaum of our private equity business line was $107.7 billion at december 31, 2023, an increase of $5.4 billion, compared to $102.3 billion at december 31, 2022.
the increase was primarily attributable to new capital raised from private equity vehicles for private wealth investors, our core private equity strategy portfolio, and ascendant fund. partially offsetting the increase was (i) a reduction in fpaum for the write-off of envision healthcare corporation and genesiscare pty. ltd., (ii) distributions to fund investors primarily as a result of realized proceeds, most notably from americas fund xii, and (iii) a reduction in fee base for european fund iii and china growth fund, which no longer pay management fees.
uncalled capital commitments from private equity funds and other investment vehicles from which kkr is currently not earning management fees amounted to approximately $16.5 billion at december 31, 2023, which includes capital commitments reserved for follow-on investments for funds that have completed their investment periods. this capital will generally begin to earn management fees upon deployment of the capital or upon the commencement of the fund's investment period. the average annual management fee rate associated with this capital is approximately 1.0%. the date on which we begin to earn fees (as specified above) is not guaranteed to occur and may not occur for an extended period of time. if and when such management fees are earned, a portion of existing fpaum may cease paying fees or pay lower fees, thus offsetting a portion of any new management fees earned.

insurance segment operating earnings insurance segment operating earnings increased for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily due to higher net investment income resulting from the increase in the investment portfolio due to the inflows from new business volumes and higher average yields. the increase was offset in part by (i) higher net cost of insurance, primarily due to the growth in both the individual market and institutional market channels and the associated higher funding costs on the new business and the ordinary course run off of older business that was originated in a lower rate environment, and (ii) a corresponding increase in general and administrative expenses.
net investment income net investment income increased for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily due to (i) increased average assets under management due to growth in assets in the institutional market channel as a result of new reinsurance transactions and individual market channel sales from new business growth, (ii) increases in portfolio yields due to higher market interest rates, and (iii) the benefit in 2023 of rotating into higher yielding assets during 2022. offsetting these increases to net investment income was a decrease in variable investment income, primarily due to a decrease in net realized gains from the sale of investments not related to asset/liability matching strategies.
net cost of insurance net cost of insurance increased for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily due to (i) growth in reserves in the institutional market as a result of new reinsurance transactions and in the individual market as a result of new business volumes, and (ii) higher average funding costs due to higher crediting rates and the routine run-off of older business originated in a lower interest rate environment.
general, administrative and other expenses general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily due to (i) an increase in interest expense on floating rate debt (i.e., global atlantic's fixed-to-floating swaps on its fixed rate debt) due to higher market interest rates and higher total debt outstanding, and (ii) increased employee compensation and benefits-related expenses.
pre-tax operating earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests pre-tax operating earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 in proportion to the increase in insurance segment operating earnings for the comparable period. pre-tax operating earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests represent the proportionate interest in the insurance segment operating earnings attributable to third party co-investors in global atlantic.

distributable operating earnings the decrease in distributable operating earnings for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a lower level of asset management segment operating earnings partially offset by a higher level of insurance segment operating earnings. for a discussion of the asset management and insurance segment operating earnings, see "-analysis of asset management segment operating results" and "-analysis of insurance segment operating results."
after-tax distributable earnings the decrease in after-tax distributable earnings for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a lower level of distributable operating earnings and an increase in interest expense partially offset by a decrease in income taxes on operating earnings.
interest expense the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior period was primarily due to (i) the issuance of fixed rate notes in the current year and (ii) higher market interest rates and higher revolving borrowings outstanding in the current year under the kcm short-term credit facility for use in our capital markets business line.

the increase in private equity business line management fees was primarily attributable to a higher level of management fees earned from north america fund xiii and european fund vi. the increase was partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from european fund v and americas fund xii as a result of entering their post-investment periods and, consequently, we now earn fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and at a lower fee rate. during the fourth quarter of 2022, approximately $11 million of management fees were earned on new capital raised that is retroactive to the start of the fund's investment period.
the increase in real assets business line management fees was primarily due to (i) a higher level of management fees earned from global infrastructure investors iv, (ii) an increase in management fees earned from global atlantic and (iii) management fees earned on assets managed by kjrm, which we acquired in 2022. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from (i) real estate partners americas ii as a result of a decline in capital invested from investment realizations (of which this investment fund's fee base is invested capital) and (ii) global infrastructure investors iii as a result of entering its post-investment period and, consequently, we now earn fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed.

our capital markets business line earns transaction fees, which are not shared with fund investors. the decrease in transaction fees was primarily due to a decrease in the number of capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. overall, we completed 240 capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2022, of which 29 represented equity offerings and 211 represented debt offerings, as compared to 358 transactions for the year ended december 31, 2021, of which 60 represented equity offerings and 298 represented debt offerings. we earned fees in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. while each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this business line is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we earn for similar transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes.
our capital markets fees are generated in connection with our private equity, real assets, and credit and liquid strategies business lines as well as from third-party companies. for the year ended december 31, 2022, approximately 14% of our transaction fees in our capital markets business line were earned from unaffiliated third parties as compared to approximately 23% for the year ended december 31, 2021. our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from north america, europe, and the asia-pacific region. for the year ended december 31, 2022, approximately 46% of our transaction fees were generated outside of north america as compared to approximately 38% for the year ended december 31, 2021. our capital markets business line is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads, and volatility. our capital markets business line does not generate monitoring fees.
our private equity, real assets, and credit and liquid strategies business lines separately earn transaction and monitoring fees from portfolio companies, and under the terms of the management agreements with certain of our investment funds, we are required to share all or a portion of such fees with our fund investors. additionally, transaction fees are generally not earned with respect to energy and real estate investments.
the decrease in our private equity business line transaction and monitoring fees, net, was primarily attributable to a lower average transaction fee earned in 2022. during the year ended december 31, 2022, there were 77 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $5.3 million compared to 76 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $5.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2021. for the year ended december 31, 2022, approximately 46% of private equity transaction fees were paid by companies in north america, 31% were paid from companies in the asia-pacific region, and 23% were paid from companies in europe. transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the amount of the fees as set forth in the transaction agreements, the complexity of the transaction, and kkr's role in the transaction.

fee related performance revenues were higher for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior period primarily due to performance revenues earned from kppa and kjrm in the current period.
fee related compensation the increase in fee related compensation for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a higher level of compensation recorded in connection with the higher level of revenues included within fee related earnings.
other operating expenses the increase in other operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior period was primarily due to (i) a higher level of professional fees, information technology and other administrative costs in connection with the growth of the firm and (ii) an increase in travel related expenses as a result of a return of travel activity to pre-covid-19 pandemic levels.
fee related earnings the increase in fee related earnings for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior period is primarily due to a higher level of management fees from our private equity, real assets, and credit and liquid strategies business lines and a higher level of fee related performance revenues, partially offset by a lower level of transaction and monitoring fees, net, and a higher level of fee related compensation and other operating expenses, as described above.

insurance segment operating earnings insurance segment operating earnings decreased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) higher net cost of insurance, primarily due to the growth in both global atlantic's individual market and institutional market channels and higher funding cost on new business, and (ii) a corresponding increase in general and administrative expenses. the decrease was offset in part by (i) higher net investment income resulting from an increase in average assets under management due to growth of the business, and higher average yields, and (ii) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the 2021 ga acquisition having occurred on february 1, 2021.
net investment income net investment income increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the 2021 ga acquisition having occurred on february 1, 2021, (ii) growth in portfolio yields due to higher market interest rates on floating rate investments, (iii) rotation into higher yielding assets, and (iv) increased average assets under management due to growth in assets in global atlantic's institutional market channel as a result of new reinsurance transactions and individual market channel sales from new business growth. offsetting these increases to net investment income was a decrease in variable investment income, primarily due to the non-recurrence of net realized gains from the sale of investments not related to asset/liability matching strategies, including in particular the disposition of origis usa, llc, reported in the prior financial reporting period.
net cost of insurance net cost of insurance increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the 2021 ga acquisition having occurred on february 1, 2021, (ii) growth in reserves in the institutional market as a result of new reinsurance transactions and in the individual market as a result of new business volumes, and (iii) higher funding costs on new business originated, and (iv) the impact of assumption review (as described in "-consolidated results of operations (gaap basis)-insurance-assumption review" above).
general, administrative and other expenses general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the 2021 ga acquisition having occurred on february 1, 2021, (ii) increased employee compensation and benefits-related expenses, (iii) increased professional service fees, and (iv) increased tpa policy servicing fees, all due to growth of the business.

distributable operating earnings the decrease in distributable operating earnings for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior period is primarily due to a lower level of asset management segment operating earnings and insurance segment operating earnings. for a discussion of the asset management and insurance segment operating earnings, see "-analysis of asset management segment operating results" and "-analysis of insurance segment operating results."
after-tax distributable earnings the decrease in after-tax distributable earnings for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a lower level of distributable operating earnings and an increase in interest expense and income taxes on operating earnings, partially offset by a decrease in preferred dividends.
interest expense the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior period is due primarily to debt issuances by kkr's financing subsidiaries.
preferred dividends the decrease in preferred dividends for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior period was attributable to the redemption of all of our series a and b preferred.
income taxes on operating earnings the increase in income taxes on operating earnings for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a lower tax benefit from equity-based compensation and an increase in u.s. state and local taxes.
for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of the tax benefit from equity-based compensation included in income taxes on operating earnings was $65.4 million and $123.1 million, respectively. the inclusion of the tax benefit from equity-based compensation in after-tax distributable earnings had the effect of increasing this measure by 2% and 3%, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021.

book value increased 13% from december 31, 2022. the increase was primarily attributable to (i) the net appreciation in the value of our investment portfolio, (ii) an increase in net unrealized carried interest, most notably from americas fund xii, asian fund iii, and global infrastructure investors iii, and (iii) the positive impact of our after-tax distributable earnings recognized in the period. partially offsetting these increases were the payment of dividends and repurchases of our common stock during the period. the value of our asset management segment investments increased 12% in the period. for a further discussion, see "-consolidated results of operations (gaap basis) - asset management-investment income (loss) - asset management-unrealized gains and losses from investment activities." for a discussion of the changes in our investment portfolio, see "-analysis of asset management segment operating results-assets under management." for a discussion of factors that impacted kkr's after-tax distributable earnings, see "-analysis of non-gaap performance measures-after-tax distributable earnings" and for more information about the factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations, see "risk factors" "-business environment."

with respect to kkr's book value relating to its insurance business, kkr includes global atlantic's book value, which consists of kkr's pro rata equity interest in global atlantic on a gaap basis, excluding (i) accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and (ii) accumulated change in fair value of reinsurance embedded derivative balances and related assets, net of income tax. kkr believes this presentation of global atlantic's book value is comparable with the corresponding metric presented by other publicly traded companies in global atlantic's industry. as of december 31, 2023, kkr's pro rata interest in global atlantic's book value was $5.0 billion. for more information about the composition and credit quality of global atlantic's investments on a consolidated basis, please see "-global atlantic's investment portfolio" below.
global atlantic's investment portfolio as of december 31, 2023, 96% and 88% of global atlantic's available-for-sale ("afs") fixed maturity securities were considered investment grade under ratings from the securities valuation office of the naic and nrsros, respectively. as of december 31, 2022, 95% and 85% of global atlantic's afs fixed maturity securities were considered investment grade under ratings from naic and nrsros, respectively. securities where a rating by an nrsro was not available are considered investment grade if they have an naic designation of "1" or "2." the three largest asset categories in global atlantic's afs fixed-maturity security portfolio as of december 31, 2023 were corporate securities, residential mortgage-backed securities ("rmbs") and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("cmbs"), comprising 28%, 6% and 5% of global atlantic's investment portfolio, respectively. within these categories, 95%, 96% and 93% of global atlantic's corporate, rmbs and cmbs securities, respectively, were investment grade according to naic ratings and 95%, 61% and 56% of its corporate, rmbs and cmbs securities, respectively, were investment grade according to nrsro ratings as of december 31, 2023. the three largest asset categories in global atlantic's afs fixed-maturity security portfolio as of december 31, 2022 were corporate, rmbs and cmbs securities, comprising 29%, 5% and 5% of global atlantic's investment portfolio, respectively. within these categories, 94%, 95% and 95% of global atlantic's corporate, rmbs and cmbs securities, respectively, were investment grade according to naic ratings and 94%, 45% and 53% of its corporate, rmbs and cmbs securities, respectively, were investment grade according to nrsro ratings as of december 31, 2022. nrsro and naic ratings have different methodologies. global atlantic believes the naic ratings methodology, which considers the likelihood of recovery of amortized cost as opposed to the recovery of all contractual payments including the principal at par, as the more appropriate way to view the ratings quality of its afs fixed maturity portfolio since a large portion of its holdings were purchased at a significant discount to par value. the portion of global atlantic's investment portfolio consisting of floating rate assets was 27% and 29% as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively.
within the funds withheld receivable at interest portfolio, 97% of the fixed maturity securities were investment grade by naic designation as of both december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022.
trading fixed maturity securities back funds withheld payable at interest where the investment performance is ceded to reinsurers under the terms of the respective reinsurance agreements.
credit quality of afs fixed maturity securities the securities valuation office of the naic evaluates the afs fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called "naic designations." using an internally developed rating is permitted by the naic if no rating is available. these designations are generally similar to the credit quality designations of nrsros for marketable fixed maturity securities, except for certain structured securities as described below. naic designations of "1," highest quality, and "2," high quality, include fixed maturity securities generally considered investment grade by nrsros. naic designations "3" through "6" include fixed maturity securities generally considered below investment grade by nrsros.
consistent with the naic process and procedures manual, an nrsro rating was assigned based on the following criteria: (i) the equivalent s&p rating where the security is rated by one nrsro; (ii) the equivalent s&p rating of the lowest nrsro when the security is rated by two nrsros; and (iii) the equivalent s&p rating of the second lowest nrsro if the security is rated by three or more nrsros. if the lowest two nrsros' ratings are equal, then such rating will be the assigned rating. nrsros' ratings available for the periods presented were s&p, fitch, moody's, dbrs, inc. and kroll bond rating agency, inc. if no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.
substantially all of the afs fixed maturity securities portfolio, 96% and 95% as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively, was invested in investment grade assets with a naic rating of 1 or 2.
the portion of the afs fixed maturity securities portfolio that was considered below investment grade by naic designation was 4% and 5% as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively. pursuant to global atlantic's investment guidelines, global atlantic actively monitors the percentage of its portfolio that is held in investments rated naic 3 or lower and must obtain an additional approval from global atlantic's management investment committee before making a significant investment in an asset rated naic 3 or lower.
corporate fixed maturity securities global atlantic maintains a diversified portfolio of corporate fixed maturity securities across industries and issuers. as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, 58% and 59% of the afs fixed maturity securities portfolio was invested in corporate fixed maturity securities, respectively. as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, approximately 6% and 5% of the portfolio is denominated in foreign currency, respectively.
as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, 95% and 94% of the total fair value of corporate fixed maturity securities is rated naic investment grade, respectively, and 95% and 94% is rated nrsros investment grade, respectively.
residential mortgage-backed securities as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, 11% and 10% of the afs fixed maturity securities portfolio was invested in rmbs, respectively. rmbs are securities constructed from pools of residential mortgages and backed by payments from those pools. excluding limitations on access to lending and other extraordinary economic conditions, global atlantic would expect prepayments of principal on the underlying loans to accelerate with decreases in market interest rates and diminish with increases in market interest rates.
the naic designations for rmbs, including prime, sub-prime, alt-a, and adjustable rate mortgages with variable payment options ("option arm"), are based upon a comparison of the bond's amortized cost to the naic's loss expectation for each security. accordingly, an investment in the same security at a lower cost may result in a higher quality naic designation in recognition of the lower likelihood the investment would result in a realized loss. prime residential mortgage lending includes loans to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. alt-a is a classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime, which also includes certain non-qualified mortgages. sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles.

liquidity we manage our liquidity and capital requirements by (a) focusing on our cash flows before the consolidation of our funds and cfes and the effect of changes in short term assets and liabilities, which we anticipate will be settled for cash within one year, and (b) seeking to maintain access to sufficient liquidity through various sources. the overall liquidity framework and cash management approach of our insurance business are also based on seeking to build an investment portfolio that is cash flow matched, providing cash inflows from insurance assets that meet our insurance companies' expected cash outflows to pay their liabilities. our primary cash flow activities typically involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, by investing in investments that generate yield (namely interest and dividends), as well as through the sale of investments and other assets; (iii) funding capital commitments that we have made to, and advancing capital to, our funds and clos; (iv) developing and funding new investment strategies, investment products, and other growth initiatives, including acquisitions of other investments, assets, and businesses; (v) underwriting and funding capital commitments in our capital markets business; (vi) distributing cash flow to our stockholders and any holders of our preferred stock, if any; and (vii) paying borrowings, interest payments, and repayments under credit agreements, our senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowing arrangements. see "-liquidity," "-liquidity needs" and "-dividends and stock repurchases."
see "risk factors" and "-business environment" for more information on factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations.
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from our funds, portfolio companies, and capital markets transactions; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds; (iii) interest and dividends from investments that generate yield, including our investments in clos; (iv) in our insurance business, cash inflows in respect of new premiums, policyholder deposits, reinsurance transactions and funding agreements, including through memberships in fhlbs; (v) realizations on and sales of investments and other assets, including the transfers of investments or other assets for fund formations (including clos and other investment vehicles); and (vi) borrowings, including advances under our revolving credit facilities, debt offerings, repurchase agreements, and other borrowing arrangements. in addition, we may generate cash proceeds from issuances of our or our subsidiaries' equity securities.
many of our investment funds like our private equity and real assets funds provide for carried interest. with respect to our carry-paying investment funds, carried interest is eligible to be distributed to the general partner of the fund only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable, and is accruing carried interest; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. even after all of the preceding conditions are met, the general partner of the fund may, in its sole discretion, decide to defer the distribution of carried interest to it to a later date. in addition, these funds generally include what is called a "clawback" provision, which provides that the general partner must return any carried interest that is paid in excess of what the general partner is entitled to receive at the end of the term of the fund, as discussed further below.
as of december 31, 2023, certain of our investment funds had met the first and second criteria, as described above, but did not meet the third criteria. in these cases, carried interest accrues on the consolidated statement of operations, but will not be distributed in cash to us as the general partner of an investment fund upon a realization event. for a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, and is otherwise accruing carried interest, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a "netting hole." when netting holes are present, realized gains on individual investments that would otherwise allow the general partner to receive carried interest distributions are instead used to return invested capital to our funds' limited partners in an amount equal to the netting hole. once netting holes have been filled with either (a) return of capital equal to the netting hole for those investments where fair value is below cost or (b) increases in the fair value of those investments where fair value is below cost, then realized carried interest will be distributed to the general partner upon a realization event. a fund that is in a position to pay cash carry refers to a fund for which carried interest is expected to be paid to the general partner upon the next material realization event, which includes funds with no netting holes as well as funds with a netting hole that is sufficiently small in size such that the next material realization event would be expected to result in the payment of carried interest. strategic investor partnerships with fund investors may require netting across the various funds in which they invest, which may reduce the carried interest we otherwise would have earned if such fund investors were to have invested in our funds without the existence of the strategic investor partnership.
as of december 31, 2023, netting holes in excess of $50 million existed at european fund v, asian fund iii, and health care strategic growth fund in the amounts of $105 million, $97 million, and $73 million, respectively. in accordance with the criteria set forth above, other funds currently have and may in the future develop netting holes, and netting holes for those and other funds may otherwise increase or decrease in the future. there are also investment funds that are not accruing carried interest and do not have a netting hole although they may be in a clawback position. if the investment fund has distributed carried interest, but subsequently does not have sufficient value to provide for the distribution of carried interest at the end of the life of the investment fund, the general partner is typically required to return previously distributed carried interest to the fund investors. although our current and former employees who received distributions of carried interest subject to clawback are required to return them to kkr, it is kkr's obligation to return carried interest subject to clawback to the fund investors. as of december 31, 2023, approximately $546 million of carried interest was subject to this clawback obligation, assuming that all applicable carry-paying funds and their alternative investment vehicles were liquidated at their december 31, 2023 fair values. as of december 31, 2023, asian fund ii is the only investment fund with a clawback obligation in excess of $50 million. see note 24 "commitments and contingencies-contingent repayment guarantees" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information. see also the negative amounts included in the carried interest column in the table included in this item 7 in "asset management-private equity" for further information on clawback obligations.
we have access to funding under various credit facilities, other borrowing arrangements and other sources of liquidity that we have entered into with major financial institutions or which we receive from the capital markets.
for a discussion of our debt obligations, including our debt securities, revolving credit agreements and loans, see note 16 "debt obligations" in our financial statements.
liquidity needs we expect that our (including global atlantic's) primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to meet various obligations, including, without limitation, to:
•continue to support and grow our asset management business, including seeding new investment strategies, supporting capital commitments made by our vehicles to existing and future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies and otherwise supporting the investment vehicles that we sponsor;
•continue to support and grow our insurance business;
•grow and expand our businesses generally, including by acquiring or launching new, complementary or adjacent businesses;
•warehouse investments in portfolio companies or other investments for the benefit of one or more of our funds, accounts or clos or other investment vehicles pending the contribution of committed capital by the fund investors in such vehicles, and advancing capital to them for operational or other needs;
•service debt obligations including the payment of obligations at maturity, on interest payment dates or upon redemption, as well as any contingent liabilities, including from litigation, that may give rise to future cash payments, including funding requirements to levered investment vehicles or structured transactions;
•fund cash operating expenses and contingencies, including for litigation matters and guarantees;
•pay corporate income taxes and other taxes;
•pay policyholders and amounts in our insurance business related to investment, reinvestment, reinsurance or funding agreement activity;
•pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement;
•pay cash dividends in accordance with our dividend policy for our common stock or the terms of our preferred stock, if any;
•underwrite commitments, advance loan proceeds and fund syndication commitments within our capital markets business;
•post or return collateral in respect of derivative contracts;
•acquire other assets (including businesses, investments and other assets) for our businesses, some of which may be required to satisfy regulatory requirements for our capital markets business or risk retention requirements for clos (to the extent they may apply);
•address capital needs of regulated subsidiaries as well as non-regulated subsidiaries; and
•repurchase shares of our common stock or retire equity awards pursuant to the share repurchase program or repurchase or redeem other securities issued by us.
for a discussion of kkr's share repurchase program, see note 22 "equity" in our financial statements.
capital commitments the agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to such funds, which generally range from 2% to 8% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain funds (i) where we are pursuing newer strategies, (ii) where third party investor demand is limited, and (iii) where a larger commitment is consistent with the asset allocation strategy in our principal activities business line, including core investments and exposure to the asia-pacific region.

other commitments in addition to the uncalled commitments to our investment funds as shown above, kkr has entered into contractual commitments primarily with respect to underwriting transactions, debt financing, revolving credit facilities, and equity syndications in our capital markets business line. as of december 31, 2023, these commitments amounted to $0.3 billion.
whether these amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part, depends on the contractual terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to closing or funding. our capital markets business has arrangements with third parties, which reduce our risk under certain circumstances when underwriting certain debt transactions, and thus our unfunded commitments as of december 31, 2023 have been reduced to reflect the amount to be funded by such third parties. in the case of purchases of investments or assets in our principal activities business line, the amount to be funded includes amounts that are intended to be syndicated to third parties, and the actual amounts to be funded may be less. for more information about our capital markets business line's risks, see "risk factors-risks related to our business-our capital markets activities expose us to material risks" in this report.
from time to time, we fund various underwriting, syndication and fronting commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the arranging or underwriting of loans, securities or other financial instruments, for which we may draw all or substantially all of our availability for borrowings under our available credit facilities. we generally expect these borrowings by our capital markets business to be repaid promptly as these commitments are syndicated to third parties or otherwise fulfilled or terminated, although we may in some instances elect to retain a portion of the commitments for our own investment. for more information about our capital markets business risks, see "risk factors-risks related to our business-our capital markets activities expose us to material risks" in this report.
tax receivable agreement on may 30, 2022, kkr terminated the tax receivable agreement with kkr holdings other than with respect to exchanges of kkr holdings units completed prior to such date. as of december 31, 2023, an undiscounted payable of $406.7 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed for certain exchanges of kkr holdings units that took place prior to the termination of the tax receivable agreement. as of december 31, 2023, approximately $76.7 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement since inception.
dividends and stock repurchases a dividend of $0.165 per share of our common stock has been declared and will be paid on march 1, 2024 to holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on february 16, 2024.
on september 15, 2023, each outstanding share of the series c mandatory convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 1.1700 shares of common stock, subject to cash being paid to holders in lieu of fractional shares, as applicable. in addition, a dividend of $0.75 per share of series c mandatory convertible preferred stock was paid on september 15, 2023 to holders of record of series c mandatory convertible preferred stock as of the close of business on september 1, 2023.
when kkr & co. inc. receives distributions from kkr group partnership, holders of exchangeable securities receive their pro rata share of such distributions from kkr group partnership.
the declaration and payment of dividends to our common stockholders will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and our dividend policy may be changed at any time. we announced on february 6, 2024 that our current dividend policy will be to pay dividends to holders of our common stock in an annual aggregate amount of $0.70 per share (or a quarterly dividend of $0.175 per share) beginning with the dividend to be announced with the results of the quarter ending march 31, 2024. the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors based on a number of factors, including kkr's future financial performance and other considerations that the board of directors deems relevant, and compliance with the terms of kkr & co. inc.'s certificate of incorporation and applicable law. for u.s. federal income tax purposes, any dividends we pay (including dividends on our preferred stock) generally will be treated as qualified dividend income for u.s. individual stockholders to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for u.s. federal income tax purposes. there can be no assurance that future dividends will be made as intended or at all or that any particular dividend policy for our common stock will be maintained. furthermore, the declaration and payment of distributions by kkr group partnership and our other subsidiaries may also be subject to legal, contractual and regulatory restrictions, including restrictions contained in our debt agreements.
since 2015, kkr has repurchased, or retired equity awards representing, a total of 91.9 million shares of common stock for $2.5 billion, which equates to an average price of $27.32 per share. for further information, see "part ii-item 5-market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities."
contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies in the ordinary course of business, we (including global atlantic) and our consolidated funds and cfes enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. contractual arrangements include (1) commitments to fund the purchase of investments or other assets (including obligations to fund capital commitments as the general partner of our investment funds) or to fund collateral for derivative transactions or otherwise, (2) obligations arising under our senior notes, subordinated notes, and other indebtedness, (3) commitments by our capital markets business to underwrite transactions or to lend capital, (4) obligations arising under insurance policies written, (5) other contractual obligations, including servicing agreements with third-party administrators for insurance policy administration, and (6) commitments to fund the business, operations or investments of our subsidiaries. in addition, we may incur contingent liabilities for claims that may be made against us in the future. for more information about these contingent liabilities, please see note 24 "commitments and contingencies" in our financial statements.

(1)these uncalled commitments represent amounts committed by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds which are actively investing. because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. however, given the size of such commitments and the pace at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. see "-liquidity needs" and note 16 "debt obligations" in our financial statements.
(2)amounts include senior notes and subordinated notes issued by kkr and its subsidiaries. kfn's debt obligations are non-recourse to kkr beyond the assets of kfn.
(3)these interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the term of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at december 31, 2023 is not repaid until its maturity. future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of december 31, 2023, including both variable and fixed rates, as applicable, provided for by the relevant debt agreements. the amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness.
(4)represents various commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the underwriting of loans, securities and other financial instruments. these commitments are shown net of amounts syndicated.
(5)represents obligations in our capital markets business to lend under various revolving credit facilities.
(6)represents commitments of kkr's asset management business line including kfn to fund the purchase of various investments.
(7)global atlantic has other obligations related to collateral payable held for derivative instruments ($45.1 million) and outstanding commitments to make investments in commercial mortgage loans, other lending facilities and other investments ($4.2 billion) which have not been included in the above table as the exact timing of these payments cannot be estimated. global atlantic's debt obligations are non-recourse to kkr beyond the assets of global atlantic.
(8)policy liabilities for insurance obligations consist of amounts required to meet future obligations for future policy benefits and policy account balances. amounts presented in the table represent estimated cash payments under such contracts, including significant assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums, mortality, lapse, renewal, withdrawal, and annuitization comparable with actual experience. these assumptions also include market growth and policy crediting. all estimated cash payments are not discounted to present value. accordingly, the total of cash flows presented for all years of $191.9 billion significantly exceeds total policy liabilities of $160.1 billion recorded on the statements of financial condition as of december 31, 2023. estimated cash payments are also presented gross of reinsurance. due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could differ materially from actual results.
(9)the payments due by period for debt obligations reflect the contractual maturities of principal.
(10)reflects estimated future interest payments. future interest on variable rate debt (which includes borrowing under global atlantic's revolving credit facility and the subordinated debentures) was computed using prevailing rates as of december 31, 2023 and, as such, does not consider the impact of future rate movements. future interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations.
(11)reflects operational servicing agreements with third-party administrators for policy administration.
(12)represents uncalled commitments of our consolidated funds excluding kkr's portion of uncalled commitments as the general partner of the respective funds. because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. however, given the size of such commitments and the pace at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. see "-liquidity needs" and note 16 "debt obligations" in our financial statements.

(15)the interest obligations on debt of our cfes and other borrowings represent estimated interest to be paid over the term of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at december 31, 2023 is not repaid until its maturity. future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of december 31, 2023, including both variable and fixed rates, as applicable, provided for by the relevant debt agreements. the amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness.
the commitment table above excludes contractual amounts owed under the tax receivable agreement because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts due are not presently known. see "-liquidity needs-tax receivable agreement" in this report and "risk factors-risks related to our organizational structure-we will be required to pay certain principals for most of the benefits relating to our use of tax attributes we receive from historical exchanges of our common stock for kkr group partnership units" in this report.
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of fees, capital allocation-based income (loss), expenses, investment income, and income taxes. our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. however, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. if actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. we believe our critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions.
for a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" in our financial statements included in this report.
basis of accounting we consolidate the financial results of kkr group partnership and its consolidated entities, which include the accounts of our investment advisers, broker-dealers, global atlantic's insurance companies, the general partners of certain unconsolidated investment funds, general partners of consolidated investment funds and their respective consolidated investment funds and certain other entities including cfes.
when an entity is consolidated, we reflect the accounts of the consolidated entity, including its assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income, cash flows and other amounts, on a gross basis. while the consolidation of an investment fund or entity does not have an effect on the amounts of net income attributable to kkr or kkr's stockholders' equity that kkr reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation under gaap. this is due to the fact that the accounts of the consolidated entities are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to third parties are reflected as single line items. the single line items in which the accounts attributable to third parties are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations.
the presentation in the financial statements reflect the significant industry diversification of kkr by its acquisition of global atlantic. global atlantic operates an insurance business, and kkr operates an asset management business, each of which possess distinct characteristics. as a result, kkr developed a two-tiered presentation approach for the financial statements in this management's discussion and analysis. kkr believes that these separate presentations provide a more informative view of the consolidated financial position and results of operations than traditional aggregated presentations. kkr believes that reporting global atlantic's insurance operations separately is appropriate given, among other factors, the relative significance of global atlantic's policy liabilities, which are not obligations of kkr (other than the insurance companies that issued them). if a traditional aggregated presentation were to be used, kkr would expect to eliminate or combine several identical or similar captions, which would condense the presentations but would reduce transparency. kkr also believes that using a traditional aggregated presentation would result in no new line items compared to the two-tier presentation included in the financial statements in this report.
consolidation kkr consolidates all entities that it controls either through a majority voting interest or as the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities ("vies"). the following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of consolidation principles impact our financial results, and management's process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. for a detailed description of our accounting policy on consolidation, see note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" in our financial statements included in this report.
as part of its consolidation procedures, kkr evaluates: (1) whether it holds a variable interest in an entity, (2) whether the entity is a vie, and (3) whether the kkr's involvement would make it the primary beneficiary. the determination that kkr holds a controlling financial interest in an investment vehicle significantly changes the presentation of our consolidated financial statements.
the assessment of whether we consolidate an investment vehicle we manage requires the application of significant judgment. these judgments are applied both at the time we become involved with an investment vehicle and on an ongoing basis and include, but are not limited to:
•determining whether our management fees, carried interests or incentive fees represent variable interests - we make judgments as to whether the fees we earn are commensurate with the level of effort required for those fees and at market rates. in making this judgment, we consider, among other things, the extent of third party investment in the entity and the terms of any other interests we hold in the vie.
•determining whether a legal entity qualifies as a vie - for those entities where kkr holds a variable interest, management determines whether each of these entities qualifies as a vie and, if so, whether or not kkr is the primary beneficiary. the assessment of whether the entity is a vie is generally performed qualitatively, which requires judgment. these judgments include: (a) determining whether the equity investment at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) evaluating whether the equity holders, as a group, can make decisions that have a significant effect on the economic performance of the entity, (c) determining whether two or more parties' equity interests should be aggregated, and (d) determining whether the equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses or rights to receive returns from an entity. entities that do not qualify as vies are generally assessed for consolidation as voting interest entities. under the voting interest entity model, kkr consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest.
•concluding whether kkr has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie - as there is no explicit threshold in gaap to define "potentially significant," we must apply judgment and evaluate both quantitative and qualitative factors to conclude whether this threshold is met.
changes to these judgments could result in a change in the consolidation conclusion for a legal entity.
fair value measurements fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.
gaap establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. investments and other financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:
level i pricing inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date.
level ii pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies.
level iii pricing inputs are unobservable for the financial instruments and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the financial instrument. the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. the valuation of our level iii investments at december 31, 2023 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments in an orderly transaction at such date.
in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
level iii valuation methodologies our investments and financial instruments are impacted by various economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the carried interest and investment income we realize. additionally, a change in interest rates could have a significant impact on valuations.
across the total level iii private equity investment portfolio (including core private equity investments), and including investments in both consolidated and unconsolidated investment funds, approximately 60% of the fair value is derived from investments that are valued based exactly 50% on market comparables and 50% on a discounted cash flow analysis. less than 1% of the fair value of this level iii private equity investment portfolio is derived from investments that are valued either based 100% on market comparables or 100% on a discounted cash flow analysis. as of december 31, 2023, the overall weights ascribed to the market comparables methodology, the discounted cash flow methodology, and a methodology based on pending sales for this portfolio of level iii private equity investments were 39%, 54%, and 7%, respectively.
there is inherent uncertainty involved in the valuation of level iii investments, and there is no assurance that, upon liquidation, kkr will realize the values reflected in our valuations. our valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had an active market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. see "risk factors" and "-business environment" for more information on factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations.
key unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on our level iii valuations as described above are included in note 9 "fair value measurements" in our financial statements.
level iii valuation process the valuation process involved for level iii measurements is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of level iii investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review.
for private equity and real asset investments classified as level iii, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable companies and other factors. kkr begins its procedures to determine the fair values of its level iii assets approximately one month prior to the end of a reporting period, and kkr follows additional procedures to ensure that its determinations of fair value for its level iii assets are appropriate as of the relevant reporting date. these preliminary valuations are reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by kkr to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of kkr's valuations annually for all level iii private equity and real asset investments and quarterly for investments other than certain investments, which have values less than preset value thresholds and which in the aggregate comprise less than 1% of the total value of kkr's level iii private equity and real asset investments. the valuations of certain real asset investments are determined solely by independent valuation firms without the preparation of preliminary valuations by our investment professionals, and instead such independent valuation firms rely on valuation information available to it as a broker or valuation firm. for credit investments, an independent valuation firm is generally engaged by kkr to assist with the valuations of most investments classified as level iii. the valuation firm either provides a value, provides a valuation range from which kkr's investment professionals select a point in the range to determine the valuation, or performs certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of kkr's valuations. after reflecting any input from the independent valuation firm, the valuation proposals are submitted for review and approval by kkr's valuation committees. as of december 31, 2023, less than 4% of the total value of our level iii credit investments were not valued with the engagement of an independent valuation firm.
for level iii investments in asset management, kkr has a global valuation committee that is responsible for coordinating and implementing the firm's valuation process to ensure consistency in the application of valuation principles across portfolio investments and between periods. the global valuation committee is assisted by the asset class-specific valuation committees that exist for private equity (including core equity investments and certain impact investments), growth equity (including certain impact investments), real estate, energy, infrastructure and credit. the asset class-specific valuation committees are responsible for the review and approval of all preliminary level iii valuations in their respective asset classes on a quarterly basis. the members of these valuation committees are comprised of investment professionals, including the heads of each respective strategy, and professionals from business operations functions such as legal, compliance and finance, who are not primarily responsible for the management of the investments. all level iii valuations for investments in asset management are also subject to approval by the global valuation committee, which is comprised of senior employees including investment professionals and professionals from business operations functions, and includes kkr's chief financial officer, chief legal officer and general counsel, and chief compliance officer. when valuations are approved by the global valuation committee after reflecting any input from it, the valuations of level iii investments, as well as the valuations of level i and level ii investments, are presented to the audit committee of the board of directors of kkr & co. inc. and are then reported to the board of directors.
level iii investments held by global atlantic are valued on the basis of pricing services, broker-dealers or internal models. global atlantic performs a quantitative and qualitative analysis and review of the information and prices received from independent pricing services as well as broker-dealers to verify that it represents a reasonable estimate of fair value. as of december 31, 2023, approximately 88% of these investments were priced via external sources, while approximately 12% were valued on the basis of internal models. for all the internally developed models, global atlantic seeks to verify the reasonableness of fair values by analyzing the inputs and other assumptions used. these preliminary valuations are reviewed, based on certain thresholds, by an independent valuation firm engaged by global atlantic to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of global atlantic's valuations. when valuations are approved by global atlantic's management, the valuations of its level iii investments, as well as the valuations of level i and level ii investments, are presented to the audit committee of the board of directors of kkr & co. inc. and are then reported to the board of directors.
as of december 31, 2023, upon completion by, where applicable, independent valuation firms of certain limited procedures requested to be performed by them on certain level iii investments, the independent valuation firms concluded that the fair values, as determined by kkr (including global atlantic), of those investments reviewed by them were reasonable. the limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards and were not conducted on all level iii investments. we are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that we are required to undertake to determine the fair value of the commensurate investments.
as described above, level ii and level iii investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable inputs, and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable inputs had existed. additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of investments for which readily observable inputs exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and stockholders' equity that we report from time to time.
changes in the fair value of investments impacts the amount of carried interest that is recognized as well as the amount of investment income that is recognized for investments held directly in asset management and through our consolidated funds as described below. we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of investments held directly and through consolidated investment funds generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities for investments held directly and through investment funds and a more significant impact to the amount of carried interest recognized, regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. with respect to consolidated investment funds, the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to kkr would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value of our consolidated funds would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our balance sheet investments. with respect to insurance, a decrease in investment income for certain assets where investment gains and losses are recognized through the statement of operations would impact kkr only to the extent of our economic ownership interest in global atlantic.
as of december 31, 2023, there were no investments which represented greater than 5% of total investments on a gaap basis. on a segment basis, as of december 31, 2023, investments which represented greater than 5% of total asset management segment investments consisted of usi, inc. and petvet care centers, llc and valued at $1,915 million and $1,134 million, respectively. our investment income on a gaap basis and our book value can be impacted by volatility in the public markets related to our holdings of publicly traded securities, including our sizable holdings of crescent and bridgebio pharma, inc. see "risk factors" and "-business environment" for a discussion of factors that may impact the valuations of our investments, financial results, operating results and valuations, and "-non-gaap balance sheet measures" for additional information regarding our largest holdings on a segment basis.
business combinations kkr accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, under which the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the fair values determined by management as of the acquisition date.
management's determination of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date is based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involve a significant degree of judgment. we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include, but are not limited to, future expected cash inflows and outflows, future fundraising assumptions, expected useful life, discount rates and income tax rates. our estimates for future cash flows are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying assets acquired. we estimate the useful lives of the intangible assets based on the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefit from the asset. we base our estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual result.
income taxes significant judgment is required in estimating the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. in evaluating these judgments, we consider, among other items, projections of taxable income (including the character of such income), beginning with historic results and incorporating assumptions of the amount of future pretax operating income. these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that kkr uses to manage its business. a portion of the deferred tax assets are not considered to be more likely than not to be realized. for that portion of the deferred tax assets for global atlantic, a valuation allowance has been recorded. revisions in estimates and/or actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. please see note 18 "income taxes" in our financial statements in this report for further details.
critical accounting policies and estimates - asset management revenues fees and other fees and other consist primarily of (i) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, clos, other vehicles, and separately managed accounts; (ii) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities; (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies; (iv) expense reimbursements from certain investment funds and portfolio companies; and (v) consulting fees. these fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. these termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes.
transaction fee calculations and management fee calculations based on committed capital or invested capital typically do not require discretion and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or judgments. management fee calculations based on net asset value depend on the fair value of the underlying investments within the investment vehicles. estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used as well as economic conditions.
capital allocation-based income (loss)
capital allocation-based income (loss) is earned from those arrangements whereby kkr serves as general partner and includes income or loss from kkr's capital interest as well as "carried interest" which entitles kkr to a disproportionate allocation of investment income or loss from an investment fund's limited partners.
carried interest is recognized upon appreciation of the funds' investment values above certain return hurdles set forth in their partnership agreement. kkr recognizes revenues attributable to capital allocation-based income based upon the amount that would be due pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were terminated at that date. accordingly, the amount recognized reflects kkr's share of the gains and losses of the associated funds' underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. because of the inherent uncertainty in measuring the fair value of investments in the absence of observable market prices as previously discussed, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material.
expenses compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense includes (i) base cash compensation consisting of salaries and wages, (ii) benefits, (iii) carry pool allocations, (iv) equity-based compensation and (v) discretionary cash bonuses.
to supplement base cash compensation, benefits, carry pool allocations, and equity-based compensation, we typically pay discretionary cash bonuses, which are included in compensation and benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations, based principally on the level of (i) management fees and other fee revenues (including incentive fees), (ii) realized carried interest and (iii) realized investment income earned during the year. the amounts paid as discretionary cash bonuses, if any, are at our sole discretion and vary from individual to individual and from period to period, including having no cash bonus. we accrue discretionary cash bonuses when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable which is generally in the period when we make the decision to pay discretionary cash bonuses and is based upon a number of factors, including the recognition of fee revenues, realized carried interest, realized investment income and other factors determined during the year.
beginning in 2021, we expect to pay our employees by assigning a percentage range to each component of asset management segment revenues. prior to january 1, 2024, based on the current components and blend of our asset management segment revenues on an annual basis, we expected to use approximately: (i) 20‐25% of fee related revenues, (ii) 60‐70% of realized carried interest and incentive fees not included in fee related performance revenues or earned from our hedge fund partnerships, and (iii) 10‐20% of realized investment income and hedge fund partnership incentive fees, to pay our asset management employees. beginning in january 2024, we expect to use approximately: (i) 15%-20% of fee related revenues, (ii) 70%-80% of realized carried interest and incentive fees not included in fee related performance revenues or earned from our hedge fund partnerships, and (iii) 10%-20% of realized investment income and hedge fund partnership incentive fees, to pay our asset management employees. because these ranges are applied to applicable asset management segment revenue components independently, and on an annual basis, the amount paid as a percentage of total asset management segment revenue will vary and will, for example, likely be higher in a period with relatively higher realized carried interest and lower in a period with relatively lower realized carried interest. we decide whether to pay a discretionary cash bonus and determine the percentage of applicable revenue components to pay compensation only upon the occurrence of the realization event. there is no contractual or other binding obligation that requires us to pay a discretionary cash bonus to the asset management employees, except in limited circumstances.
assuming that we had accrued compensation of (i) 65% of the unrealized carried interest earned by the funds that allocate 40% and 43% to the carry pool and (ii) 15% of the unrealized net gains in our principal activities business line (in each case at the mid-point of the ranges above), kkr & co. inc. stockholders' equity - common stock as of december 31, 2023 would have been reduced by approximately $1.88 per share, compared to our reported $25.83 per share on such date, and our book value as of december 31, 2023 would have been reduced by approximately $1.88 per adjusted share, compared to our reported book value of $30.95 per adjusted share on such date.
carry pool allocation with respect to our funds that provide for carried interest, we allocate a portion of the realized and unrealized carried interest that we earn to associates holdings, which we refer to as the carry pool, from which our asset management employees and certain other carry pool participants are eligible to receive a carried interest allocation. as of december 31, 2023, the allocation is determined based upon a fixed arrangement between associates holdings and us, and we do not exercise discretion on whether to make an allocation to the carry pool upon a realization event. we refer to the portion of carried interest that we allocate to the carry pool as the carry pool percentage. these amounts are accounted for as compensatory profit sharing arrangements in accrued expenses and other liabilities within the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition in conjunction with the related carried interest income and are recorded as compensation expense. upon a reversal of carried interest income, the related carry pool allocation, if any, is also reversed. accordingly, such compensation expense is subject to both positive and negative adjustments.
as of december 31, 2023, the carry pool percentage was fixed at 40%, 43% or 65% by investment fund, depending on the fund's vintage. for funds that closed after december 31, 2020 but before december 31, 2023, the carry pool percentage was fixed at 65%. for all funds that closed after june 30, 2017 but before december 31, 2020, the carry pool percentage was fixed at 43%, and the carry pool percentage was fixed at 40% for older funds that contributed to our carry pool. effective january 2, 2024, we are authorized to apply a carry pool percentage in excess of these fixed percentages of up to 80% for all funds. as of the date of this filing, no carry pool percentage has been changed for our funds that have closed on or before december 31, 2023. this increase to the carry pool percentage was approved by a majority of our independent directors, and the carry pool percentage may not be increased above 80% without the further approval of a majority of our independent directors.
as disclosed above, we record compensation for our asset management employees in an amount that equates to 60‐70% of realized carried interest and incentive fees which are not included in fee related performance revenues or earned from our hedge fund partnerships. the amounts recorded as compensation for the year ended december 31, 2023 and certain prior periods are greater than the amounts allocated to the carry pool for those periods. any amounts recorded as compensation that are higher than the amounts allocated in accordance with the percentages referenced above represent discretionary cash bonus compensation to our asset management employees. the amounts paid as discretionary cash bonuses, if any, are at our discretion and vary from individual to individual and from period to period, including having no cash bonus at all for certain employees. see "-revenues-capital allocation-based income (loss)" and "-compensation and benefits" above.
on the sunset date (which will not be later than december 31, 2026), kkr will acquire control of associates holdings and will commence making decisions regarding the allocation of the carry proceeds pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of associates holdings. until the sunset date, our co-founders will continue to make decisions regarding the allocation of the carry proceeds to themselves and others, pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of associates holdings, provided that any allocation of carry proceeds to the co-founders will be on a percentage basis consistent with past practice. for additional information about the sunset date and the reorganization agreement, see note 1 "organization" in our financial statements included in this report.
equity-based compensation in addition to the cash-based compensation and carry pool allocations as described above, employees receive equity awards under our equity incentive plans, most of which are subject to service-based vesting typically over a three to five-year period from the date of grant, and some of which are also subject to the achievement of market-based conditions. certain of these awards are subject to post-vesting transfer restrictions and minimum retained ownership requirements.
compensation expense relating to the issuance of equity-based awards is measured at fair value on the grant date. in determining the aggregate fair value of any award grants, we make judgments as to the grant-date fair value, particularly for certain restricted units with a vesting condition based upon market conditions, whose grant date fair values are based on a probability distributed monte-carlo simulation. see note 19 "equity based compensation," in our financial statements included in this report for further discussion and activity of these awards.
investment income (loss) -net gains (losses) from investment activities net gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities as well as income earned from certain equity method investments. fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. the fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains from, our investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. for a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments, see the above "-critical accounting policies and estimates-fair value measurements."
critical accounting policies and estimates - insurance policy liabilities policy liabilities, or collectively, "reserves," are the portion of past premiums or assessments received that are set aside to meet future policy and contract obligations as they become due. interest accrues on the reserves and on future premiums, which may also be available to pay for future obligations. global atlantic establishes reserves to pay future policy benefits, claims, and certain expenses for its life policies and annuity contracts.
global atlantic's reserves are estimated based on models that include many actuarial assumptions and projections. these assumptions and projections, which are inherently uncertain, involve significant judgment, including assumptions as to the levels and/or timing of premiums, benefits, claims, expenses, interest credits, investment results (including equity market returns), mortality, longevity, and persistency.
the assumptions on which reserves are based are intended to represent an estimation of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. global atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves and the assumptions underlying those reserves at least annually. global atlantic cannot, however, determine with precision the amount or the timing of actual benefit payments. if actual experience is better than or equal to the assumptions, then reserves would be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. if experience is worse than the assumptions, additional reserves may be required to meet future policy and contract obligations. this would result in a charge to global atlantic's net income during the period in which excess benefits are paid or an increase in reserves occurs.
for a majority of global atlantic's in-force policies, including its interest-sensitive life policies and most annuity contracts, the base policy reserve is equal to the account value. for these products, the account value represents global atlantic's obligation to repay to the policyholder the amounts held with global atlantic on deposit. however, there are several significant blocks of business where policy reserves, in addition to the account value, are explicitly calculated, including variable annuities, fixed-indexed annuities, interest-sensitive life products (including those with secondary guarantees), and preneed policies.
the critical accounting estimates and related sensitivities, reported below have been updated from those reported in the annual report to reflect the impact from the adoption of ldti (see note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" in our financial statements included in this report.)
market risk benefits market risk benefits are contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the policyholder from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose global atlantic to other-than-nominal capital market risk. market risk benefits include certain contract features on fixed annuity and variable annuity products, including minimum guarantees to policyholders, such as guaranteed minimum death benefits (gmdbs), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (gmwbs), and long-term care benefits (which are capped at the return of account value plus one or two times the account value).
some of global atlantic's variable annuity and fixed-indexed annuity contracts contain a gmdb feature that provides a guarantee that the benefit received at death will be no less than a prescribed minimum amount, even if the account balance is reduced to zero. this amount is based on either the net deposits paid into the contract, the net deposits accumulated at a specified rate, the highest historical account value on a contract anniversary, or sometimes a combination of these values. if the gmdb is higher than the current account value at the time of death, global atlantic incurs a cost equal to the difference.
global atlantic issues fixed-indexed annuity and variable annuity contracts with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal feature. gmwb are an optional benefit where the contract owner is entitled to withdraw a maximum amount of their benefit base each year.
once exercised, living benefit features provide annuity policyholders with a minimum guaranteed stream of income for life. a policyholder's annual income benefit is generally based on an annual withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base. the benefit base is defined in the policy and is generally the initial premium, reduced by any partial withdrawals and increased by a defined percentage, formula or index credits. any living benefit payments are first deducted from the account value. global atlantic is responsible for paying any excess guaranteed living benefits still owed after the account value has reached zero.
the ultimate cost of these benefits will depend on the level of market returns and the level of contractual guarantees, as well as policyholder behavior, including surrenders, withdrawals, and benefit utilization. for global atlantic's fixed-indexed annuity products, costs also include certain non-guaranteed terms that impact the ultimate cost, such as caps on crediting rates that global atlantic can, in its discretion, reset annually.
see note 17 - "policy liabilities" in our financial statements for additional information.
as of december 31, 2023, the net market risk liability balance totaled $1.1 billion. as of december 31, 2023, the liability balances for market risk benefits were $868.3 million for fixed-indexed annuities and $238.5 million for variable and other annuities. the increase (decrease) to the net market risk benefit liability balance as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, instrument-specific credit risk, equity market prices, expected mortality, and expected surrenders are summarized in the table below. this sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other assumptions used in or items considered in the measurement of such balances.

policy liabilities accounted for under a fair value option variable annuity contracts offered and assumed by global atlantic provide the contractholder with a gmdb. the liabilities for these benefits are included in policy liabilities. global atlantic elected the fair value option to measure the liability for certain of these variable annuity contracts valued at $354.0 million as of december 31, 2023. fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated death benefits less the present value of the gmdb fees, using 1,000 risk neutral scenarios. global atlantic discounts the cash flows using the u.s. treasury rates plus an adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk in the consolidated statement of financial condition. the change in the liabilities for these benefits is included in policy benefits and claims in the consolidated statement of operations.
as of december 31, 2023, variable annuities accounted for using the fair value option totaled $354.0 million. the increase (decrease) in the reserves for variable annuities accounted for using the fair value option as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, instrument-specific credit risk, equity market prices, expected mortality, and expected surrenders are summarized in the table below. this sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other assumptions used in or items considered in the measurement of such balances.

liability for future policyholder benefits a liability for future policy benefits, which is the present value of estimated future policy benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and certain related expenses less the present value of estimated future net premiums to be collected from policyholders, is accrued as premium revenue is recognized. the liability is estimated using current assumptions that include mortality, lapses, and expenses. these current assumptions are based on judgments that consider global atlantic's historical experience, industry data, and other factors, and are updated quarterly and the current period change in the liability is recognized as a separate component of benefit expense in the consolidated income statement.
as of december 31, 2023, the liability for future policy benefits totaled $8.6 billion, net of reinsurance, split between $8.2 billion associated with payout annuity products, and $393.4 million of life and other insurance products. the increase (decrease) as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, credit spreads, expected mortality, and expected surrenders and lapses are summarized in the table below. this sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other assumptions used in or items considered in the measurement of such balances.

(1)includes decrements for terminations of disability insurance additional liability for annuitization, death, or other insurance benefits: no-lapse guarantees global atlantic has in-force interest-sensitive life contracts where it provides a secondary guarantee to the policyholder. the policy can remain in-force, even if the base policy account value is zero, as long as contractual secondary guarantee requirements have been met. the primary risk to global atlantic is that the premium collected under these policies, together with the investment return global atlantic earns on that premium, is ultimately insufficient to pay the policyholder's benefits and the expenses associated with issuing and administering these policies. global atlantic holds an additional reserve in connection with these guarantees.
the additional reserves related to interest-sensitive life products with secondary guarantees are calculated using methods similar to those described above under "-critical accounting policies and estimates - insurance-policy liabilities-market risk benefits." the costs related to these secondary guarantees are recognized over the life of the contracts through the accrual and subsequent release of a reserve which is revalued each period. the reserve is calculated based on assessments, over a range of economic scenarios to incorporate the variability in the obligation that may occur under different environments. the change in the reserve is included in policy benefits and claims in the consolidated statements of operations.

embedded derivatives in policy liabilities and funds withheld global atlantic's fixed-indexed annuity, variable annuity and indexed universal life products contain equity-indexed features, which are considered embedded derivatives and are required to be measured at fair value.
global atlantic calculates the embedded derivative as the present value of future projected benefits in excess of the projected guaranteed benefits, using an option budget as the indexed account value growth rate. in addition, the fair value of the embedded derivative is reduced to reflect instrument specific credit risk on global atlantic's obligation (i.e., global atlantic's     own credit risk).
changes in interest rates, future index credits, instrument-specific credit risk, projected withdrawal and surrender activity, and mortality on fixed-indexed annuity and interest-sensitive life products can have a significant impact on the value of the embedded derivative.
valuation of embedded derivatives - fixed-indexed annuities fixed-indexed annuity contracts allow the policyholder to elect a fixed interest rate of return or a market indexed strategy where interest credited is based on the performance of an index, such as the s&p 500 index, or other indexes. the market indexed strategy is an embedded derivative, similar to a call option. the fair value of the embedded derivative is computed as the present value of benefits attributable to the excess of the projected policy contract values over the projected minimum guaranteed contract values. the projections of policy contract values are based on assumptions for future policy growth, which include assumptions for expected index credits, future equity option costs, volatility, interest rates, and policyholder behavior. the projections of minimum guaranteed contract values include the same assumptions for policyholder behavior as are used to project policy contract values. the embedded derivative cash flows are discounted using a risk-free interest rate increased by instrument-specific credit risk tied to global atlantic's own credit rating.
valuation of embedded derivatives - interest-sensitive life products interest-sensitive life products allow a policyholder's account value to grow based on the performance of certain equity indexes, which results in an embedded derivative similar to a call option. the embedded derivative related to the index is bifurcated from the host contract and measured at fair value. the valuation of the embedded derivative is the present value of future projected benefits in excess of the projected guaranteed benefits, using the option budget as the indexed account value growth rate and the guaranteed interest rate as the guaranteed account value growth rate. present values are based on discount rate curves determined at the valuation date or issue date as well as assumed lapse and mortality rates. the discount rate equals the forecast treasury rate increased by instrument-specific credit risk tied to global atlantic's own credit rating. changes in discount rates and other assumptions such as spreads and/or option budgets can have a substantial impact on the embedded derivative.
valuation of embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance or funds withheld global atlantic's reinsurance agreements include modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld arrangements that include terms that require payment by the ceding company of a principal amount plus a return that is based on a proportion of the ceding company's return on a designated portfolio of assets. because the return on the funds withheld receivable or payable is not clearly and closely related to the host insurance contract, these contracts are deemed to contain embedded derivatives, which are measured at fair value. global atlantic is exposed to both the interest rate and credit risk of the assets. changes in discount rates and other assumptions can have a significant impact on this embedded derivative. the fair value of the embedded derivatives is included in the funds withheld receivable at interest and funds withheld payable at interest line items on our consolidated statement of financial condition. the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives is recorded in net investment-related gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations.
as of december 31, 2023, the embedded derivative liability balance totaled $3.6 billion for fixed-indexed annuities, and $458.3 million for interest-sensitive life. the increase (decrease) to the embedded derivatives on fixed-indexed annuity and indexed universal life as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and equity market prices are summarized in the table below. this sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other assumptions used in or items considered in the measurement of such balances.

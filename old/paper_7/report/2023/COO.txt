operating cash flow cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023 decreased compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the payment of a $45 million termination fee under an asset purchase agreement and net changes in operating capital, partially offset by net changes in other non-cash items.

investing cash flow cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2023 was lower than cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2022, primarily attributable to $1.6 billion cash paid, net of cash acquired, for the generate acquisition in fiscal 2022. the decrease in cash used for acquisitions was partially offset by an increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment.
financing cash flow cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to repayments of $338.0 million on the 2021 364-day term loan, partially offset by $172.6 million of funds drawn on the 2020 revolving credit.

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations considering recent market conditions, we have re-evaluated our operating cash flows and cash requirements and continue to believe that current cash, cash equivalents, future cash flow from operating activities and cash available under our 2020 credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including working capital needs, capital expenditures and contractual obligations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. to the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our liquidity needs such as that for acquisitions, share repurchases, cash dividends or other activities as we execute our business strategy, we anticipate that additional funds could be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds; however, such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.
share repurchases in december 2011, the company's board of directors authorized the 2012 share repurchase program ("2012 program") and through subsequent amendments, the most recent in march 2017, the total repurchase authorization was increased from $500.0 million to $1.0 billion of the company's common stock. the program has no expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. purchases under the 2012 program are subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time and may be made from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements.
in fiscal 2023, there were no share repurchases under the 2012 program. at october 31, 2023, $256.4 million remained authorized for repurchase under the program. see note 8. stockholders' equity for additional information.

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap. we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable, however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future period. the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap.
•revenue recognition - we recognize revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers and/or when services are rendered. our payment terms are typically between 30 to 120 days. provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances and product returns are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.
product discounts, including certain rebates, sales incentives, and volume discounts are granted based on terms of the arrangement with direct distribution customers and at times the indirect end consumer. we evaluate contractual terms, historical experience, and perform internal analysis to estimate total product discounts at the time revenue is recognized. coopersurgical rebates are predominately related to the medicaid rebate provision that is estimated based upon contractual terms, historical experience, and trend analysis.
sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales return data. promotional programs, such as cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, sales incentives, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances and product returns are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. we currently disclose the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.
•business combinations - we routinely consummate business combinations. results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. we recognize separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, including acquired in-process research and development, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements. key assumptions routinely utilized the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets include discount rates, and projected financial information such as revenue projections for companies acquired. as of the acquisition date, goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration given, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
•income taxes - income taxes are estimated based on enacted income tax laws and the results of operations in each jurisdiction. deferred tax assets and liabilities are estimated based on temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not they are not expected to be realized. long-term tax payable is estimated income tax to be paid for unrecognized tax benefits. a tax benefit is recognized if it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits in a tax authority examination, based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority.

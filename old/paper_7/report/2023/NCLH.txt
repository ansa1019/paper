item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial presentation the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures we make concerning risks and other factors that may affect our business and operating results. you should read this information in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. see also "cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements" immediately prior to part i, item 1 in this annual report.
we categorize revenue from our cruise and cruise-related activities as either "passenger ticket" revenue or "onboard and other" revenue. passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to product offering, the size of the ship in operation, the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates. our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises, which has historically been strongest during the northern hemisphere's summer months; however, our cruise voyages were completely suspended from march 2020 until july 2021 due to the covid-19 pandemic and our resumption of cruise voyages was phased in gradually, with full operation of our fleet resumed in may 2022. passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations, meals in certain restaurants on the ship, certain onboard entertainment, government taxes, fees and port expenses and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us. onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from casino, beverage sales, shore excursions, specialty dining, retail sales, spa services and wi-fi services. our onboard revenue is derived from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires, from which we receive a share of their revenue.
our cruise operating expense is classified as follows:
●   commissions, transportation and other primarily consists of direct costs associated with passenger ticket revenue. these costs include travel advisor commissions, air and land transportation expenses, related credit card fees, certain government taxes, fees and port expenses and the costs associated with shore excursions and hotel accommodations included as part of the overall cruise purchase price.

●   onboard and other primarily consists of direct costs incurred in connection with onboard and other revenue, including casino, beverage sales and shore excursions.

●   payroll and related consists of the cost of wages, benefits and logistics for shipboard employees and costs of certain inventory items, including food, for a third party that provides crew and other hotel services for certain ships.

●   fuel includes fuel costs, the impact of certain fuel hedges and fuel delivery costs.

●   food consists of food costs for passengers and crew on certain ships.

●   other consists of repairs and maintenance (including dry-dock costs), ship insurance and other ship expenses.

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments. actual results could differ materially from these estimates. we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated
52
financial statements. these critical accounting policies, which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements, relate to ship accounting and asset impairment.
ship accounting ships represent our most significant assets, and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation. depreciation of ships is computed on a straight-line basis over the weighted average useful lives of primarily 30 years after a 15% reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship. our residual value is established based on our long-term estimates of the expected remaining future benefit at the end of the ships' weighted average useful lives. in 2022 and 2023, the company took delivery of norwegian's first prima class ship and oceania cruises' first allura class ship, respectively. based on the design, structure and technological advancements made to these new classes of ships and the analyses of their major components, which is generally performed upon the introduction of a new class of ship, we have assigned the prima class ships and allura class ships a weighted-average useful life of 35 years with a residual value of 10%. ship improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements' estimated useful lives or the remaining useful life of the ship. when we record the retirement of a ship component included within the ship's cost basis, we estimate the net book value of the component being retired and remove it from the ship's cost basis. repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred. we account for dry-dock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all dry-dock costs as incurred.
we determine the weighted average useful lives of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the costs and useful lives of the ships' major component systems on the date of acquisition, such as cabins, main diesels, main electric, superstructure and hull, and their related proportional weighting to the ship as a whole. the useful lives of components of new ships and ship improvements are estimated based on the economic lives of the new components. in addition, to determine the useful lives of the major components of new ships and ship improvements, we consider the impact of the historical useful lives of similar assets, manufacturer recommended lives, planned maintenance programs and anticipated changes in technological conditions. given the large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require judgment and are uncertain. should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values, depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher.
if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. if we reduced our estimated weighted average ship service life by one year, depreciation expense for the year ended december 31, 2023 would have increased by $19.4 million. in addition, if our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by $84.4 million. we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied. we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships' costs to the periods that benefit from the ships' usage.
asset impairment we review our long-lived assets, principally ships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. for ship impairment analyses, the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities is each individual ship. we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. we estimate fair value based on the best information available utilizing estimates, judgments and projections as necessary. our estimate of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the associated risk.
53
we evaluate goodwill and trade names for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. in 2023, we changed our annual evaluation date for impairment from december 31 to october 1. we believe this measurement date, which represents a change in the method of applying an accounting principle, is preferable because it better aligns with the timing of the company's financial planning process, which is a key component of the annual impairment tests. the change in the measurement date did not delay, accelerate or prevent an impairment charge. the accounting policy change is not material and will be applied prospectively. for our evaluation of goodwill, we use a qualitative assessment which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. for trade names we also provide a qualitative assessment to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
in order to make this evaluation, we consider whether any of the following factors or conditions exist:
●   changes in general macroeconomic conditions, such as a deterioration in general economic conditions; limitations on accessing capital; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; or other developments in equity and credit markets;

●   changes in industry and market conditions such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates; an increased competitive environment; a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (in both absolute terms and relative to peers); a change in the market for an entity's products or services; or a regulatory or political development;

●   changes in cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows;

●   decline in overall financial performance (for both actual and expected performance);

●   entity and reporting unit specific negative events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; litigation; or a change in the composition or carrying amount of net assets; and

●   decline in share price (in both absolute terms and relative to peers).

it is at our discretion whether to perform the qualitative test and we may bypass the qualitative test in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. we may also, at our discretion, resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
we believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our long-lived assets, principally ships, goodwill, trade names and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reasonable. nonetheless, if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets, we could be required to record an impairment charge. if a material change occurred or the result of the qualitative assessment indicated it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, we would conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value to its carrying value.
we have concluded that our business has three reporting units. each brand, oceania cruises, regent seven seas and norwegian, constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and, therefore, each brand is considered an operating segment.
for our annual impairment evaluation, we performed a quantitative assessment for the regent seven seas reporting unit and of each brand's trade names. based on the results of the assessment, we determined there was no impairment of goodwill because the fair value of the regent seven seas reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value. as of december 31, 2023, there was $98.1 million of goodwill remaining for the regent seven seas reporting unit. trade names were $500.5 million as of december 31, 2023. as of october 1, 2023, our annual impairment reviews support the carrying values of these assets. see note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" for more information.
54
non-gaap financial measures we use certain non-gaap financial measures, such as adjusted gross margin, net yield, net cruise cost, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel, adjusted ebitda, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted eps, to enable us to analyze our performance. see "terms used in this annual report" for the definitions of these and other non-gaap financial measures. we utilize adjusted gross margin and net yield to manage our business on a day-to-day basis because it reflects revenue earned net of certain direct variable costs. we also utilize net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to manage our business on a day-to-day basis. in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts our net income (loss), we believe changes in adjusted gross margin, net yield, net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance. per capacity day data is not presented for the year ended december 31, 2022 as we do not consider it meaningful for comparison purposes due to our phased restart of cruise operations, which was completed in may 2022.
we believe that adjusted ebitda is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance. we also believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating costs, marketing, general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. in addition, management uses adjusted ebitda as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. adjusted ebitda is not a defined term under gaap nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income (loss), as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments.
in addition, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted eps are non-gaap financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement gaap net income (loss) and eps. we use adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted eps as key performance measures of our earnings performance. we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-gaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. these non-gaap financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparison to our historical performance. in addition, management uses adjusted eps as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. the amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-gaap financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly, our presentation of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted eps may not be indicative of future adjustments or results. for example, for the year ended december 31, 2022, we incurred $12.1 million related to restructuring costs or charges. we included this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss) since the expenses are not representative of our day-to-day operations; however, this adjustment did not occur and is not included in the comparative period presented within this annual report.
you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our non-gaap financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-gaap financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis. in evaluating our non-gaap financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation. our non-gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap. our presentation of our non-gaap financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. our non-gaap financial measures may not be comparable to other companies. please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the "results of operations" section.
financing transactions in february 2023, nclc issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028. the net proceeds from the notes were used to repay the loans outstanding under our term loan a facility that otherwise would have become due in january 2024, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as related premiums, fees and expenses.
in february 2023, our $1 billion commitment letter was extended through february 2024, with an option for nclc to further extend the commitments through february 2025 at its election. simultaneously, the amount of the commitment
55
was reduced to $650 million, which may be drawn in up to two draws, and in connection with the execution of the current commitment letter, nclc issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior secured notes due 2028. nclc used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. in february 2024, we extended the $650 million undrawn commitment from february 2024 to march 2024 while maintaining our option to further extend the commitment. we are currently taking steps to refinance the commitment, which is subject to approval by our board of directors. we expect the refinanced commitment to be extended for one year through march 2025, when effective.
in october 2023, nclc issued $790 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior secured notes due 2029. the net proceeds from the notes, together with cash on hand, were used to repay the term loan a facility, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as related premiums, fees and expenses. no term loans remain outstanding.
also in october 2023, nclc entered into the sixth arca, an amendment and restatement of the senior secured credit facility, which among other things, increased the aggregate amount of the revolving loan facility from $875 million to $1.2 billion.

update on bookings the company continues to experience healthy consumer demand and is at an all-time high booked position and with pricing reflective of some of the best booking weeks in the company's history beginning with black friday and cyber monday. however, because of our cancellation policies, bookings may not be representative of actual revenues. additionally, onboard revenue remains robust, with broad-based strength across all revenue streams.
as a result of the ongoing conflict in israel and the red sea, the company cancelled and redirected all calls to israel during the fourth quarter of 2023. additionally, all calls to israel and the red sea have been cancelled and redirected for the entirety of 2024. prior to the conflict, approximately 7% of the capacity in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 4% of capacity for the full year 2024 expected to visit the middle east, which includes bahrain, cyprus, egypt, israel, jordan, oman, qatar, saudi arabia, and the united arab emirates. approximately 1% of second quarter 2024 capacity and 1% of 2024 capacity were expected to sail through the red sea.
macroeconomic trends and uncertainties as a result of conditions associated with global macroeconomic events, the global economy, including the financial and credit markets, has experienced volatility and disruptions, including impacts to inflation rates, fuel prices, foreign currencies and interest rates. our costs have been, and are expected to continue to be, adversely impacted by these factors. we have used, and may continue to use, derivative instruments to attempt to mitigate the risk of volatility in fuel prices and interest rates. in an attempt to mitigate risks related to inflation, our supply chain department has negotiated contracts with varying terms, with a goal of providing us with the ability to take advantage of cost declines when they occur, and diversified our sourcing options. these strategies may not fully offset the impact of current macroeconomic conditions; however, during 2023, we continued to see progress from our ongoing margin enhancement initiative. the company continues to prioritize identifying and evaluating a variety of initiatives to improve its cost structure and margin profile, while preserving its brand equity and optimal guest satisfaction levels. furthermore, we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for certain portions of ship construction contracts that have not been hedged. see "item 1a. risk factors" in our annual report for additional information.
climate change we believe the increasing focus on climate change, including the company's recently established targets for greenhouse gas reductions, and evolving regulatory requirements will materially impact our future capital expenditures and results of operations. we have set interim targets to guide us on our path to net zero and provide more details about them in our annual esg report. we expect to incur significant expenses related to these regulatory requirements and commitments, which may include expenses related to greenhouse gas emissions reduction initiatives and the purchase of emissions
56
allowances, among other things. we have and may continue to be required to change certain operating procedures, for example slowing the speed of our ships, to meet regulatory requirements, which could adversely impact our operations. we are evaluating the effects of global climate change related requirements, which are still evolving, including our ability to mitigate certain future expenses through initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; consequently, the full impact to the company is not yet known. additionally, our ships, port facilities, corporate offices and island destinations have in the past and may again be adversely affected by an increase in the frequency and intensity of adverse weather conditions caused by climate change. for example, certain ports have become temporarily unavailable to us due to hurricane damage and other destinations have either considered or implemented restrictions on cruise operations due to environmental concerns. refer to "impacts related to climate change may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations" in "item 1a. risk factors" for further information.
pillar 2 and income tax expense during the three months ended december 31, 2023, in response to changes in the global tax landscape due to the implementation of the oecd's pillar 2 global tax reform initiative, the company restructured its organizational footprint by realigning many of its operations across its three different brands into a single jurisdiction, bermuda, and exited our u.k. tax residency status for nclh and nclc as of december 31, 2023. the company continues to monitor further regulations related to the implementation of the bermuda corporate income tax act, and the forecast of the company's non-exempt taxable income in the bermuda and u.s. jurisdictions, and the outlooks for the cruise industry and broader economy. as a result of the enactment of the bermuda corporate income tax act 2023, the company recognized additional deferred tax assets and has a valuation allowance related to our bermuda deferred tax assets of $532.4 million as of december 31, 2023. the bermuda deferred tax assets amount will continue to be evaluated through the enactment date, january 1, 2025, and is subject to material change as this is an estimated amount. refer to note 12 - "income taxes" for further information. additionally, the company continues to maintain a valuation allowance with respect to its u.s. net deferred tax assets, which has a balance of $159.8 million as of december 31, 2023. we will continue to evaluate all relevant positive and negative evidence in monitoring the realizability of our deferred tax assets and determining the appropriate timing for the recognition of any valuation allowance reversal. in the future, the company may recognize a material reversal of its valuation allowance on both its u.s. and bermuda deferred tax assets. the company would not expect to have a material change in its income tax expense, with the exception of any potential impact from a release of the valuation allowance.

year ended december 31, 2023 ("2023") compared to year ended december 31, 2022 ("2022")
revenue total revenue increased 76.5% to $8.5 billion in 2023 compared to $4.8 billion in 2022. in 2023, revenue primarily increased as a result of increases in our occupancy following our return to service with 23.3 million passenger cruise days compared to 12.8 million in 2022.
expense total cruise operating expense increased 28.2% in 2023 compared to 2022. in 2023, our cruise operating expenses increased due to the resumption of voyages, resulting in higher payroll, food and direct variable costs of fully operating ships. in 2022, the year started with 16 ships operating with guests onboard and ended with the full fleet in service, which was completed in may 2022. gross cruise cost increased 20.6% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily related to the change in costs described above.
interest expense, net was $727.5 million in 2023 compared to $801.5 million in 2022. the decrease in 2023 primarily reflects lower losses from extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs, which were $8.8 million in 2023 and $193.4 million in 2022. excluding these losses, interest expense increased primarily as a result of higher rates.
other income (expense), net was expense of $40.2 million in 2023 compared to income of $76.6 million in 2022. in 2023, the expense primarily related to net losses on foreign currency remeasurements. in 2022, the income was primarily due to gains on derivatives not designated as hedges and gains from foreign currency remeasurements.
liquidity and capital resources general as of december 31, 2023, our liquidity of $2.3 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $402.4 million, borrowings available under our $1.2 billion fully undrawn revolving loan facility and a $650 million undrawn commitment less related fees. our primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital, capital expenditures and debt service. as of december 31, 2023, we had a working capital deficit of $4.7 billion. this deficit included $3.1 billion of advance ticket sales, which represents the total revenue we collected in advance of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities. our business model, along with our liquidity and undrawn export-credit backed facilities, allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet our operating, investing and financing needs.
in february 2023, nclc issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028. the net proceeds from the notes were used to repay the loans outstanding under our term loan a facility that otherwise would have become due in january 2024, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as related premiums, fees and expenses.
in february 2023, our $1 billion commitment letter was extended through february 2024, with an option for nclc to further extend the commitments through february 2025 at its election. simultaneously, the amount of the commitment was reduced to $650 million, which may be drawn in up to two draws, and in connection with the execution of the current commitment letter, nclc issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior secured notes due 2028. nclc used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. in february 2024, we extended the $650 million undrawn commitment from february 2024 to march 2024 while maintaining our option to further extend the commitment.
in october 2023, nclc issued $790 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior secured notes due 2029. the net proceeds from the notes, together with cash on hand, were used to repay the term loan a facility, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as related premiums, fees and expenses.
62
also in october 2023, nclc entered into the sixth arca, an amendment and restatement of the senior secured credit facility, which among other things, increased the aggregate amount of the revolving loan facility from $875 million to $1.2 billion. no term loans remain outstanding.
refer to note 8 - "long-term debt" for further details about the above financing transactions.
based on our liquidity estimates and our current resources, we have concluded we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our obligations for at least the next 12 months. there can be no assurance that the accuracy of the assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will be correct, and our ability to be predictive is uncertain due to the dynamic nature of the current operating environment, including any current macroeconomic events and conditions such as inflation, rising fuel prices and higher interest rates.
as noted above, we extended the $650 million undrawn commitment from february 2024 to march 2024 while maintaining our option to further extend the commitment. in february 2024, the commitment parties (as defined in note 8 - "long-term debt") entered into a third amended and restated commitment letter (the "third amended commitment letter"), which is expected to become effective in march 2024. the effectiveness is subject to approval by our board of directors. upon effectiveness, the third amended commitment letter will amend and restate the current commitment letter and extend the commitments thereunder through march 2025. pursuant to the third amended commitment letter, and subject to effectiveness thereof, the commitment parties have agreed to purchase from nclc an aggregate principal amount of $650 million of senior unsecured notes due five years after the issue date (the "commitment notes") at nclc's option. if drawn, the commitment notes will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (a) the greater of (i) the interest rate of the 7.75% senior notes due 2029 ("2029 unsecured notes") and (ii) the then-current secondary trading yield applicable to the 2029 unsecured notes plus (b) 200 basis points. the commitment notes will be subject to a one-time structuring fee of 0.50% and a quarterly commitment fee of 0.75% for so long as the commitments with respect to the commitment notes are outstanding. if drawn, the commitment notes will be subject to an issue fee of 0.50%. in connection with the execution of the third amended commitment letter, and subject to effectiveness thereof, nclc has agreed to repurchase all of the outstanding class a notes (as defined in note 8 - "long-term debt") at a purchase price of 107% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
we also intend to refinance the $565.0 million 3.625% senior unsecured notes due in december 2024 prior to september 2024. within the next twelve months, we may pursue other refinancings in order to reduce interest expense and/or extend debt maturities. there is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations. beyond the next 12 months, we will pursue refinancings and other balance sheet optimization transactions in order to reduce interest expense and/or extend debt maturities. refer to item 1a, "risk factors" for further details regarding risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ from our expectations.
at december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. if we do not continue to remain in compliance with our covenants, we would have to seek additional amendments to or waivers of the covenants. however, no assurances can be made that such amendments or waivers would be approved by our lenders. generally, if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs, then pursuant to cross default and/or cross acceleration clauses, substantially all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due, and all debt and derivative contracts could be terminated, which would have a material adverse impact to our operations and liquidity.
our moody's long-term issuer rating is b2, our senior secured rating is b1 and our senior unsecured rating is caa1. our s&p global issuer credit rating is b, our issue-level rating on our $1.2 billion revolving loan facility, 2028 senior secured notes and 2029 senior secured notes is bb-, our issue-level rating on our other senior secured notes is b+ and our senior unsecured rating is ccc+. if our credit ratings were to be further downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, our industry, or us, our access to capital and the cost of any debt or equity financing will be further negatively impacted. we also have capacity to incur additional indebtedness under our debt agreements and may issue additional ordinary shares from time to time, subject to our authorized number of ordinary shares. however, there is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations.
63
as of december 31, 2023, we had advance ticket sales of $3.2 billion, including the long-term portion, which included approximately $78.0 million of future cruise credits. we also have agreements with our credit card processors that, as of december 31, 2023, governed approximately $2.9 billion in advance ticket sales that had been received by the company relating to future voyages. these agreements allow the credit card processors to require under certain circumstances, including the existence of a material adverse change, excessive chargebacks and other triggering events, that the company maintain a reserve which would be satisfied by posting collateral. although the agreements vary, these requirements may generally be satisfied either through a percentage of customer payments withheld or providing cash funds directly to the card processor. any cash reserve or collateral requested could be increased or decreased. as of december 31, 2023, we had cash collateral reserves of approximately $51.6 million, which includes $20.1 million recognized in accounts receivable, net and $31.5 million recognized in other long-term assets. during the year ended december 31, 2023, the company received a return of cash collateral from one credit card processor of $500 million, which was previously classified as other long-term assets. we may be required to pledge additional collateral and/or post additional cash reserves or take other actions in the future that may adversely affect our liquidity.
sources and uses of cash in this section, references to 2023 refer to the year ended december 31, 2023, references to 2022 refer to the year ended december 31, 2022.
net cash provided by operating activities was $2.0 billion in 2023 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $210.0 million in 2022. net cash provided by operating activities included net income (loss) and the timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to operating assets and liabilities. the net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 included net income of $166.2 million and an increase in advance ticket sales of $503.7 million. the net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 included net losses of $(2.3) billion, an increase in advance ticket sales of $928.9 million and loss on extinguishment of debt of $188.8 million.
net cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion in 2023, primarily related to three new ship deliveries and newbuild payments. net cash used in investing activities was $1.8 billion in 2022, primarily related to the delivery of norwegian prima.
net cash provided by financing activities was $346.9 million in 2023, primarily due to newbuild loans and $1.6 billion from our various note offerings, partially offset by debt repayments and a net decrease in our revolving loan facility balance. net cash provided by financing activities was $1.0 billion in 2022, primarily due to newbuild loans and the proceeds of $2.1 billion from our various note offerings partially offset by debt repayments and related redemption premiums associated with extinguishment of certain senior secured notes.
for the company's cash flow activities for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021, see "item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, which was filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission on february 28, 2023.
future capital commitments future capital commitments consist of contracted commitments, including ship construction contracts. anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts are $0.4 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.4 billion for the years ending december 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. we have export-credit backed financing in place for the anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts of $0.2 billion, $1.5 billion and $0.8 billion for the years ending december 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. anticipated non-newbuild capital expenditures are $475 million for the year ended december 31, 2024. future expected capital expenditures will significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense.
for the norwegian brand, we have four prima class ships on order, each ranging from approximately 156,300 to 169,000 gross tons with 3,550 to 3,850 berths, with currently scheduled delivery dates from 2025 through 2028. for
64
the oceania cruises brand, we have an order for one allura class ship to be delivered in 2025. the allura class ship will be approximately 67,800 gross tons and 1,250 berths.
as of december 31, 2023, the combined contract prices, including amendments and change orders, of the five ships on order for delivery was approximately €5.8 billion, or $6.4 billion based on the euro/u.s. dollar exchange rate as of december 31, 2023. we have obtained fixed-rate export-credit backed financing which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship on order, subject to certain conditions. we do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellations to occur. however, if any such events were to occur, it could result in, among other things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
capitalized interest for the year ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was $56.4 million and $58.4 million, respectively, primarily associated with the construction of our newbuild ships.

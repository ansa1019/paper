(a) certain items identified as affecting comparability are excluded in non-gaap results. see "reconciliation of non-gaap measures" for details of these items and reconciliations of non-gaap results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap").
for 2023, revenues decreased 2% to $29.65 billion, as lower revenues from our linear networks, content licensing, and theatrical releases were partially offset by growth from our streaming services, led by paramount+. the decrease in revenue from our linear networks was principally the result of continued weakness in the global advertising market and the decrease in theatrical revenues was primarily due to the comparison with the success of top gun: maverick in 2022.
we reported an operating loss of $451 million compared with operating income of $2.34 billion for the prior year. this comparison was impacted by programming charges of $2.37 billion recorded in 2023. adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization ("adjusted oibda"), which excludes these charges as well as other items described under reconciliation of non-gaap measures, decreased 27% to $2.39 billion, driven by the decline in linear and licensing revenues and the timing and mix of theatrical releases in each year, partially offset by lower content costs for our linear networks and improved results for our streaming services.
for 2023, we reported a net loss from continuing operations attributable to paramount of $1.28 billion, or $2.06 per diluted share, compared with net earnings from continuing operations attributable to paramount of $725 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, for the prior year. the comparison was impacted by the programming charges noted above and the other items described under reconciliation of non-gaap measures. these items have been excluded in adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to paramount and adjusted diluted earnings per share ("eps"), which decreased $771 million and $1.19 per diluted share, respectively, primarily reflecting the lower tax-effected adjusted oibda and losses from our investment in skyshowtime.
labor strikes in may 2023, the writers guild of america ("wga") commenced an industry-wide strike following the expiration of its collective bargaining agreement with the alliance of motion picture and television producers ("amptp"). in july 2023, the screen actors guild-american federation of television and radio artists ("sag-aftra") also commenced an industry-wide strike after the expiration of its collective bargaining agreement with ii-4

(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
the amptp. these strikes resulted in temporary shutdowns of production on certain of our television and film programming, which resulted in less new content available for licensing and for our networks and streaming services, as well as lower-than-expected spending for content and marketing costs during the second half of 2023. we resumed production during the fourth quarter, after the amptp reached agreements with the wga and sag-aftra.
reconciliation of non-gaap measures results for each of the years presented included certain items identified as affecting comparability. adjusted oibda, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to paramount, adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations, and adjusted effective income tax rate (together, the "adjusted measures") exclude the impact of these items and are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with gaap. we use these measures to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance. these measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of our operational strength and business performance. in addition, we use adjusted oibda to, among other things, value prospective acquisitions. we believe these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management; provide a clearer perspective on our underlying performance; and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results.
because the adjusted measures are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with gaap, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income (loss), earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, (provision for) benefit from income taxes, net earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to paramount, diluted eps from continuing operations, and effective income tax rate, as applicable, as indicators of operating performance. these measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.
the following tables reconcile the adjusted measures to their most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with gaap.

(a) comprised of programming charges recorded during the first half of 2023 in connection with the integration of showtime into paramount+ and initiatives to rationalize and right-size our international operations to align with our streaming strategy and close or globalize certain of our international channels. these initiatives resulted in a change in strategy for certain content, which led to content being removed from our platforms or abandoned, the write-off of development costs, distribution changes, and termination of programming agreements.
(b) reflects a charge to reduce the carrying values of fcc licenses in five markets to their estimated fair values.
(c) consists of $67 million for severance costs and $35 million for the impairment of lease assets, as further described under restructuring and other corporate matters.
(d) reflects a net benefit for other corporate matters, including a gain of $120 million from a settlement received in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with the cbs litigation, as well as insurance recoveries relating to the viacom litigation (see legal matters-stockholder matters-litigation relating to the merger), and a $23 million charge to increase our accrual for asbestos matters as discussed under legal matters-claims related to former businesses-asbestos.
(e) reflects a gain recognized on our retained interest in viacom18 following the discontinuance of equity method accounting resulting from the dilution of our interest from 49% to 13%.
(f) primarily reflects tax benefits from the resolution of an income tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction, guidance issued in 2023 by the internal revenue service ("irs") that resulted in additional foreign taxes from 2022 being eligible for a foreign tax credit, and the settlement of income tax audits, partially offset by tax expense relating to the vesting of stock-based compensation.
(g) the reported effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2023 was 28.8% and the adjusted effective income tax rate, which is calculated as the adjusted provision for income taxes of $197 million divided by adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of $973 million, was 20.2%. these adjusted measures exclude the items affecting comparability described above.

advertising revenues, partially offset by higher advertising revenues for our streaming services. in addition, foreign exchange rate changes negatively impacted the total advertising revenue comparison by 1 percentage point.
affiliate and subscription affiliate and subscription revenues are principally comprised of affiliate fees received from distributors for carriage of our cable networks (cable affiliate fees) and owned television stations (retransmission fees), fees received from television stations for their affiliation with the cbs television network (reverse compensation), and subscription fees for our streaming services.
for 2023, affiliate and subscription revenues increased 13%, primarily driven by growth in subscribers for paramount+ to 67.5 million at december 31, 2023 from 55.9 million at december 31, 2022, as well as higher revenues from pay-per-view boxing events. the increase was partially offset by lower affiliate fees for our linear networks.
theatrical theatrical revenues are principally earned from the worldwide theatrical distribution of films through audience ticket sales. for 2023, theatrical revenues decreased 34%, reflecting the comparison against the strong performance of top gun: maverick in 2022.
licensing and other licensing and other revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of the rights to exhibit our internally-produced television and film programming on various platforms in the secondary market after its initial exhibition on our owned or third-party platforms; license fees from content produced or distributed for third parties; home entertainment revenues, which include revenues from the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (tvod) and electronic sell-through services and the sale and distribution of our content through dvds and blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; and revenues from studio rentals and production services.
the 10% decrease in licensing and other revenues was driven by the timing and mix of content available for licensing, including the comparison against the success of top gun: maverick and the licensing of halloween ends in 2022. in addition, content available for licensing in the second half of 2023, as well as studio rentals and production services, were negatively impacted by temporary production shutdowns as a result of labor strikes.

content costs content costs include the amortization of costs of internally-produced television and theatrical film content; amortization of acquired program rights; other television production costs, including on-air talent; and participation and residuals expenses, which reflect amounts owed to talent and other participants in our content pursuant to contractual and collective bargaining arrangements.
for 2023, content costs decreased 1%, primarily driven by lower costs associated with licensing revenues and television content, including from the impact of production shutdowns, which reduced the content available for licensing and exhibition on our networks and streaming services. the decrease in content costs also reflects lower costs associated with theatrical releases and savings following the changes in strategy for certain content discussed under programming charges. these decreases were partially offset by increased investment in our streaming services and costs associated with pay-per-view boxing events. in addition, 2023 includes costs incurred to retain our production capabilities for certain of the delayed television and film productions, expenses for excess production overhead, and incremental costs incurred to resume film production, which totaled $131 million.
distribution and other distribution and other operating expenses primarily include costs relating to the distribution of our content, including print and advertising for theatrical releases and costs for third-party distribution; compensation; revenue-sharing costs to television stations affiliated with the cbs television network; and other ancillary and overhead costs associated with our operations.
for 2023, distribution and other operating expenses increased 10%, primarily reflecting higher costs associated with the growth of our streaming services, including costs for third-party distribution and compensation, and higher costs associated with theatrical releases.
programming charges during 2023, in connection with the integration of showtime into paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms, we performed a comprehensive strategic review of the combined content portfolio of showtime and paramount+. additionally, we commenced a review of our international content portfolio in connection with initiatives to rationalize and right-size our international operations to align with our streaming strategy, and close or globalize certain of our international channels. as a result, we changed the strategy for certain content, which led to content being removed from our platforms or abandoned, the write-off of development costs, distribution changes, and termination of programming agreements. accordingly, we recorded programming charges on the consolidated statement of operations relating to these actions during the first half of 2023. these charges, which totaled $2.37 billion, were comprised of $1.97 billion for the impairment of content to its estimated fair value, as well as $402 million for development cost write-offs and contract termination costs.

management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
in connection with our continued review of our international content strategy, during the first quarter of 2024 we made a strategic decision to focus on content with mass global appeal. as part of this, we are rationalizing original content on paramount+, especially internationally, and improving the efficiency of our linear network programming. as a result, we have reviewed our expansive global content portfolio and are removing select content from our platforms. in addition, we have decided not to move forward with certain titles and therefore are abandoning some development projects and terminating certain programming agreements. accordingly, we expect to recognize additional programming charges that we currently expect to be in the range of approximately $700 million to $900 million during the first quarter of 2024. as we continue to evaluate our content portfolio, we may incur additional programming charges later in 2024.

selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses include costs incurred for advertising, marketing, occupancy, professional service fees, and back office support, including employee compensation and technology. the 3% increase in sg&a expenses in 2023 was driven by higher costs to support the growth of our streaming services, including employee and marketing costs, as well as higher incentive compensation and technology costs. the higher marketing costs for our dtc services were largely offset by lower marketing costs for our linear networks.

depreciation and amortization expense reflects depreciation of fixed assets, including equipment under finance leases, and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense reflects increased depreciation for software related to the unification and evolution of our systems and platforms.
impairment charges for 2023 and 2022, we recorded impairment charges of $83 million and $27 million, respectively, in the tv media segment to write down the carrying values of certain of our fcc licenses to their estimated fair values (see critical accounting policies-goodwill and intangible assets impairment tests-fcc licenses).

restructuring and other corporate matters during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded the following restructuring charges and other corporate matters.

(a) severance costs include the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation.
restructuring charges since the merger, we implemented a series of initiatives designed to integrate and transform our operations, including changes in management structure. these initiatives led to restructuring actions, and as a result, we recorded restructuring charges for severance of $67 million and $260 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the actions that gave rise to the severance costs included our 2022 operating segment realignment, the integration of showtime into paramount+, and the restructuring of our international operations. in addition, during the fourth quarter of 2023, certain eligible employees voluntarily elected to participate in a plan under which they will receive one-time severance benefits, resulting in $13 million of severance costs.
we currently expect to incur additional restructuring charges for severance in the range of approximately $100 million to $200 million during the first quarter of 2024 associated with strategic changes in our global workforce.
in the years following the merger, we also consolidated our real estate portfolio to reduce our real estate footprint and create cost synergies. in connection with this consolidation, we identified lease assets that we determined we would not use and instead sublease or terminate early, which resulted in lease impairment charges of $35 million and $68 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
other corporate matters in 2023, we recorded a net benefit of $133 million in other corporate matters, principally consisting of a gain of $120 million from a settlement received in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with the final dismissal of the cbs litigation, as well as insurance recoveries relating to the viacom litigation (each as defined and further described under legal matters-stockholder matters-litigation relating to the merger). these benefits are partially offset by a charge of $23 million to increase our accrual for asbestos matters as discussed under legal matters-claims related to former businesses-asbestos.
in 2022, we recorded charges for other corporate matters of $257 million, consisting of $211 million associated with stockholder legal matters, principally relating to the merger, including a charge for the settlement of $122.5 million in connection with the final dismissal of the viacom litigation. the charges also included $46 million recorded following russia's invasion of ukraine, principally to reserve against amounts due from counterparties in russia, belarus and ukraine.
gains on dispositions during 2022, we recorded a gain of $41 million relating to the contribution of certain assets of paramount+ in the nordics to skyshowtime. also in 2022, we recorded gains totaling $15 million, comprised of a gain from the sale ii-11

revenues for 2023, revenues decreased 8%, driven by lower advertising revenues, primarily due to continued weakness in the global advertising market, and lower licensing revenues.
advertising the 12% decrease in advertising revenues was primarily the result of continued weakness in the global advertising market. domestic advertising revenues declined 12% to $7.04 billion and international advertising revenues decreased 18% to $1.15 billion. the domestic decline also reflects lower political advertising revenues as a result of u.s. midterm elections in 2022. foreign exchange rate changes negatively impacted the total advertising revenue comparison by 1 percentage point.

affiliate and subscription affiliate and subscription revenues decreased 1%. domestic affiliate and subscription revenues decreased slightly to $7.66 billion, reflecting declines in affiliate fees, which were offset by higher subscription revenues from pay-per-view boxing events. the decrease in domestic affiliate fees reflects linear subscriber declines, which were largely offset by contractual pricing increases. declines in domestic linear subscribers are expected to continue in 2024. international affiliate and subscription revenues decreased 12% to $422 million, driven by a shift of revenue from our pay television services to our streaming services following the restructuring of certain affiliate agreements.
licensing and other licensing and other revenues decreased 9%, reflecting a lower volume of licensing in the secondary market as well as lower revenues from content produced for third parties. content available for licensing in the second half of the year was impacted by temporary production shutdowns as a result of labor strikes.

subscription the 46% increase in subscription revenues was primarily driven by increases in both domestic and international paramount+ subscribers, with total growth of 11.6 million, or 21%, compared with december 31, 2022. the revenue growth also includes the impact of domestic pricing increases for each of our subscription plans that went into effect when we launched the paramount+ with showtime plan on june 27, 2023, as well as revenues from pay-per-view boxing events.
during the fourth quarter, global paramount+ subscribers increased 4.1 million, or 6%, to 67.5 million, compared with 63.4 million at september 30, 2023. the growth reflects the benefit from the nfl season and premieres of good burger 2 and lawmen: bass reeves, and growth from international markets.

fluctuations in results for the filmed entertainment segment may occur as a result of the timing of the recognition of distribution costs, including print and advertising, which are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film, while the revenues for the respective film are recognized as earned through the film's theatrical exhibition and distribution to other platforms.
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash we project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows expected to be generated and available to meet these needs. our operating needs include, among other items, expenditures for content for our broadcast and cable networks and streaming services, including television and film programming, sports rights, and talent contracts, as well as advertising and marketing costs to promote our content and platforms; payments for leases, interest, and income taxes; and pension funding obligations. certain of our cash requirements discussed above are associated with long-term contractual commitments (see notes 10 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements).
our investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures; acquisitions; funding relating to new and existing investments, including skyshowtime, our streaming joint venture with comcast corporation, under which both parent companies have committed to support initial operations over a multiyear period; discretionary share repurchases; dividends; and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness. our long-term debt obligations due over the next five years were $2.14 billion as of december 31, 2023 (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). we routinely assess our capital structure and opportunistically enter into transactions to manage our outstanding debt maturities, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.
funding for both our short-term and long-term operating, investing and financing needs will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents (which were $2.46 billion as of december 31, 2023), and our ability to refinance our debt. any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. to the extent that commercial paper is not available to us, the borrowing capacity under our $3.50 billion credit facility described below is sufficient to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. in addition, if necessary, we can increase our liquidity position by reducing non-committed spending.
our access to capital markets and the cost of any new borrowings can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic and market conditions, as well as by ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. as a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us.

(a)    at december 31, 2023 and 2022, the senior and junior debt balances included (i) a net unamortized discount of $419 million and $442 million, respectively, and (ii) unamortized deferred financing costs of $81 million and $89 million, respectively. the face value of our total debt was $15.10 billion at december 31, 2023 and $16.38 billion at december 31, 2022.
senior debt at december 31, 2023, our senior debt was comprised of senior notes and debentures due between 2025 and 2050 with interest rates ranging from 2.90% to 7.875%.
during the fourth quarter of 2023, we repurchased $1.04 billion of our outstanding senior notes due between 2025 and 2027 through a tender offer, for an aggregate repurchase price of $1.00 billion. these repurchases resulted in a pre-tax gain on extinguishment of debt of $29 million. in 2023, we also repaid our $139 million of 7.875% debentures and $35 million of 7.125% senior notes, each at maturity.
in 2022, we redeemed senior notes totaling $2.39 billion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.49 billion and redeemed, at par, our $520 million of 5.875% junior subordinated debentures due february 2057. these redemptions resulted in a total pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $120 million.
our outstanding senior notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. there is an acceleration trigger for $9.67 billion of the senior notes and debentures that requires us to make a redemption offer at 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of ratings downgrades to below investment grade by all three ratings agencies (moody's investors service, inc., s&p global ratings and fitch ratings, ltd.) due to a change of control.
junior debt in 2022, we issued $1.00 billion of 6.375% junior subordinated debentures due 2062. the interest rate on these debentures will reset on march 30, 2027, and every five years thereafter to a fixed rate equal to the 5-year treasury rate (as defined pursuant to the terms of the debentures) plus a spread of 3.999% from march 30, 2027, 4.249% from march 30, 2032 and 4.999% from march 30, 2047. these debentures can be called by us at par plus a make whole premium any time before march 30, 2027, or at par on march 30, 2027 or on any interest payment date thereafter.
our $643 million of 6.25% junior subordinated debentures due february 2057 accrue interest at the stated fixed rate until february 28, 2027, on which date the rate will switch to a floating rate. under the terms of the debentures the floating rate is based on three-month libor plus 3.899%, reset quarterly, however, with the phasing out of libor and the passage of the adjustable interest rate (libor) act, signed into law on march 15, ii-22
management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
2022, it is expected that the 6.25% junior subordinated debentures due 2057 will, upon switching to a floating rate, bear interest at a replacement rate based on three-month cme term secured overnight financing rate (sofr). these debentures can be called by us at par at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period.
our junior subordinated debentures also provide for certain covenant packages. in the event of ratings downgrades by all three rating agencies due to a change of control, there is a provision in the junior subordinated debentures that requires us to either elect to redeem the debentures at 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest or, if we elect not to redeem the debentures, the interest rate will be increased by 5 percentage points.
the subordination and extended term, as well as an interest deferral option of the junior subordinated debentures provide significant credit protection measures for senior creditors and, as a result of these features, the debentures received a 50% equity credit by standard & poor's rating services and fitch ratings inc., and a 25% equity credit by moody's investors service, inc.
commercial paper at both december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings.
credit facility during 2023, we amended and extended our $3.50 billion revolving credit facility (the "credit facility"), which now matures in january 2027 (the "2023 amendment"). the credit facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper borrowings, if any. we may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the credit facility. borrowing rates under the credit facility are determined at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the u.s. or an applicable benchmark rate plus a margin (based on our senior unsecured debt rating), depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered into. under the 2023 amendment, we replaced libor as the benchmark rate for loans denominated in u.s. dollars with term sofr. the benchmark rate for loans denominated in euros, sterling and yen is based on euribor, sonia and tibor, respectively. the credit facility also includes a provision that the occurrence of a change of control of paramount will be an event of default that would give the lenders the right to accelerate any outstanding loans and terminate their commitments. at december 31, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and the availability under the credit facility was $3.50 billion.
the credit facility has one principal financial covenant which sets a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio ("leverage ratio") at the end of each quarter, which prior to the 2023 amendment was 4.5x. under the 2023 amendment, the maximum leverage ratio was increased to 5.75x for each quarter through and including the quarter ending september 30, 2024, and will then decrease to 5.5x for the quarters ending december 31, 2024 and march 31, 2025, with decreases of 0.25x for each subsequent quarter until it reaches 4.5x for the quarter ending march 31, 2026. the leverage ratio reflects the ratio of our consolidated indebtedness, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at the end of a quarter, to our consolidated ebitda (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. under the 2023 amendment, the definition of the leverage ratio was also modified to set the maximum amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents that can be netted against consolidated indebtedness to $1.50 billion for quarters ending on or after september 30, 2024. in addition, under the 2023 amendment, simon & schuster was treated as a continuing operation for the purposes of calculating consolidated ebitda until its disposition in october 2023. we met the covenant as of december 31, 2023.

other bank borrowings at december 31, 2023, we had no outstanding bank borrowings under miramax's $50 million credit facility, which matures in november 2024. this facility replaced the previous $300 million credit facility that matured in april 2023. at december 31, 2022, we had $55 million of bank borrowings under the previous facility with a weighted average interest rate of 7.09%.
letters of credit and surety bonds at december 31, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $213 million that were not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, as well as a $1.9 billion standby letter of credit facility, under which no letters of credit were issued. in january 2024, in accordance with the contractual requirements of one of our commitments, a $1.9 billion letter of credit was issued under this facility. the amount outstanding under the letter of credit will decrease throughout 2024 as we make payments under the related contractual commitment. letters of credit and surety bonds are primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business under contractual requirements of certain of our commitments. the standby letter of credit facility, which matures in may 2026, is subject to the same principal financial covenant as the credit facility.
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.
we consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. the risks and uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies are provided below. unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our audit committee. for a summary of our significant accounting policies, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when control of a good or service is transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. significant judgments used in the determination of the amount and timing of revenue recognition include the identification of distinct performance obligations in contracts containing bundled advertising sales or bundled content licenses, and the allocation of consideration among individual performance obligations within these arrangements based on their relative standalone selling prices.
advertising revenues-advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising spots are aired on television or streamed or displayed on digital platforms. if a contract includes a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating or number of impressions, the delivery of the advertising spots that achieve the guarantee represents the performance obligation to be satisfied over time and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the ii-24
management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
audience rating or impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. to the extent the amounts billed exceed the amount of revenue recognized, such excess is deferred until the guaranteed audience ratings or impressions are delivered. for contracts that do not include impressions guarantees, the individual advertising spots are the performance obligation and consideration is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative standalone selling price.
affiliate revenues-the performance obligation for our affiliate agreements is a license to our programming provided through the continuous delivery of live linear feeds and, for agreements with certain distributors, also includes a license to programming for video-on-demand viewing. affiliate revenues are recognized over the term of the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligation by continuously providing our customer with the right to use our programming. for agreements that provide for a variable fee, revenues are determined each month based on an agreed upon contractual rate applied to the number of subscribers to our customer's service. for agreements that provide for a fixed fee, revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the content provided over the term of the agreement. these agreements primarily include agreements with television stations affiliated with the cbs television network ("network affiliates") for which fair value is determined based on the fair value of the network affiliate's service and the value of our programming.
content licensing revenues-for licenses of exhibition rights for internally-produced programming, each individual episode or film delivered represents a separate performance obligation and revenues are recognized when the episode or film is made available to the licensee for exhibition and the license period has begun. for license agreements that include delivery of content on one or more dates for a fixed fee, consideration is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each episode or film, which is based on licenses for comparable content within the marketplace. estimation of standalone selling prices requires judgment, which can impact the timing of recognizing revenues.
film and television production and programming costs costs incurred to produce television programs and feature films are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the projected life of each television program or feature film. the costs incurred to acquire television series and feature film programming rights, including advances, are capitalized when the license period has begun and the program is accepted and available for airing. the costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. acquired programming rights, including rights for sports programming, are expensed over the shorter of the license period or the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived.
we categorize our capitalized production and programming costs based on the expected predominant monetization strategy throughout the life of the content. our programming that is expected to be predominantly monetized through licensing and distribution on third-party platforms is considered individually monetized and our programming that is expected to be predominantly monetized on our networks and streaming services together with other programming is considered to be monetized as part of a film group. the predominant monetization strategy is determined when capitalization of production costs commences and is reassessed if there is a significant change to the expected future monetization strategy. this reassessment will include an assessment of the monetization strategy throughout the entire life of the programming.
for internally-produced television programs and feature films that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis, we use an individual-film-forecast computation method to amortize capitalized production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for participations and residuals over the applicable title's life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned ("ultimate revenues") for each title. management's judgment is required in estimating ultimate revenues and the costs to be incurred ii-25
management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
throughout the life of each television program or feature film. these estimates are used to determine the timing of amortization of capitalized production costs and expensing of participation and residual costs.
for television programming, our estimate of ultimate revenues includes revenues to be earned within 10 years from the delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, five years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later. these estimates are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs.
for feature films, our estimate of ultimate revenues includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film's initial release. prior to the release of feature films, we estimate ultimate revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as factors relating to the specific film, including the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. for films intended for theatrical release, we believe the performance during the theatrical exhibition is the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to theatrical performance. upon a film's initial release, we update our estimate of ultimate revenues based on actual and expected future performance. our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. we also review and revise estimates of ultimate revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information.
for acquired film libraries, our estimate of ultimate revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition.
for programming that is predominantly monetized as part of a film group, capitalized costs are amortized based on an estimate of the timing of our usage of and benefit from such programming. such estimates require management's judgment and include consideration of factors such as expected revenues to be derived from the programming, the expected number of future airings, and, for acquired programming, the length of the license period. if initial airings are expected to generate higher revenues, an accelerated method of amortization is used. these estimates are periodically reviewed and updated based on information available throughout the contractual term or life of each program.
for content that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis, a television program or feature film is tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its fair value may be less than its unamortized cost. if the result of the impairment test indicates that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge will then be recorded for the amount of the difference. content that is predominantly monetized within a film group is assessed for impairment at the film group level and would similarly be tested for impairment if circumstances indicate that the fair value of the film group is less than its unamortized costs. a change in the monetization strategy of content, whether monetized individually or as part of a film group, will result in a reassessment of the predominant monetization strategy and may trigger an assessment of the content for impairment. any resulting impairment test will be performed either at the individual level or at the film group level where the future cash flows will be generated. in addition, unamortized costs for internally-produced or acquired programming that has been abandoned are written off.
goodwill and intangible assets impairment tests we perform fair value-based impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised primarily of television fcc licenses, annually during the fourth quarter and also between annual tests if an event ii-26
management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
fcc licenses-fcc licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. we consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the fcc licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. at december 31, 2023, we had 14 television markets with fcc license book values, which totaled $2.31 billion.
for our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for each television market that we estimate has an aggregate fair value of fcc licenses that significantly exceeds its respective carrying value. for the 2023 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for six of our television markets. for each market, we weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. the market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for revenue and operating costs, as well as average market share. we also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates. based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the fcc licenses in each of these television markets are less than their respective carrying values. therefore, performing a quantitative impairment test on these markets was unnecessary.
we performed a quantitative impairment test for the fcc licenses in the remaining eight markets. the quantitative impairment test of fcc licenses calculates an estimated fair value using the greenfield discounted cash flow method, which values a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding discounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. the assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station's operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. the discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections. the discount rate and the long-term growth rate were 9% and 1%, respectively.
the impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair values of fcc licenses in five of the markets were below their respective carrying values. accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $83 million to write down the carrying values of these fcc licenses to their aggregate estimated fair value of $887 million. the impairment charge, which is recorded within the tv media segment, was primarily due to increased market volatility and higher interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the prior quarters of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022, which resulted in a higher discount rate. the estimated fair values of fcc licenses in the three remaining markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of $357 million, were each within 10% of their respective carrying values. for the eight markets tested, which had an aggregate carrying value of fcc licenses of $1.24 billion as of december 31, 2023, an increase to the discount rate of 50 basis points, or a decrease to the long-term growth rate of 50 basis points, assuming no changes to other factors, would cause the aggregate fair value of fcc licenses to fall below the aggregate carrying value by $97 million and $72 million, respectively.
the estimated fair values of fcc licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which we own and operate television stations. certain future events and circumstances, including continued market volatility and increases in interest rates, or a decline in the local television advertising marketplace could result in a downward revision to our current assumptions and judgments. various factors may contribute to a future decline in an advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions; an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of television advertising revenues in that market; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size.
ii-27
management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
a further downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in an additional impairment and a noncash charge would be required. such a charge could have a material effect on the consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheet.
goodwill-goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. as of december 31, 2023, we had five reporting units in three reportable segments, tv media ($11.17 billion of goodwill), direct-to-consumer ($2.73 billion of goodwill) and filmed entertainment ($2.62 billion of goodwill). the tv media segment is comprised of two reporting units with $5.16 billion of goodwill in one reporting unit and $6.01 billion in the other.
for our annual impairment test, we perform a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit that we estimate has a fair value that substantially exceeds its respective carrying value. additionally, we consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed, which was in the fourth quarter of 2021 for one reporting unit and as of january 1, 2022 for all other reporting units ("prior quantitative tests"), as described below. for the 2023 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for all reporting units. for each reporting unit, we weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. the reporting unit specific factors that were considered included actual and expected financial performance and changes to the reporting units' carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. for each industry in which the reporting units operate, we considered growth projections from independent sources, significant developments within the industry, and market factors, including changes in our market capitalization. our assessment indicated that macroeconomic factors have negatively impacted inputs used in our previous quantitative tests, including discount rates, certain industry growth rates, and revenue and earnings multiples of publicly traded companies with operations and economic characteristics comparable to each of our reporting units ("comparable company trading multiples"). we assessed the extent of the impact of the changes in these inputs in relation to the significant headroom for each reporting unit in our previous quantitative tests. based on this assessment, we concluded that while there are indicators that the fair value of most of our reporting units have declined, it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continues to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts. therefore, performing quantitative impairment tests was unnecessary.
for the 2022 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for all reporting units.
certain future events and circumstances, including further deterioration of market conditions, increases in interest rates, and declines in projections, including from continued weakness in the advertising market, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms, changes in consumer behavior, an acceleration in subscriber declines for our broadcast and cable networks, and/or a decrease in audience acceptance of our content and platforms could result in changes to our assumptions and judgments used in the goodwill impairment tests. a significant adverse change in these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values and a noncash impairment charge would be required. such a charge could have a material effect on the consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheet. in addition, while we believe our valuation methodologies are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units, the application of different valuation techniques to our reporting units, either individually or in combination, could result in a different fair value.
prior quantitative tests in the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative test for one reporting unit. in the first quarter of 2022, in connection with changes to our management structure and the resulting change in operating segments, we reassessed our reporting units and reallocated goodwill from the four reporting units in place prior to the realignment to six reporting units, using a relative fair value approach. we performed goodwill impairment tests ii-28
management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)

as of january 1, 2022 on the reporting units in place before and after the change. for these impairment tests, we performed quantitative tests for three of the reporting units that existed prior to the change and five of the reporting units in place subsequent to the change. for a quantitative goodwill impairment test we calculate an estimated fair value to determine whether it exceeds the carrying value of the respective reporting unit. we also consider the reasonableness of the market capitalization of our company in relation to the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units. for one of the quantitative tests, we estimated fair value based on the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses, and for the remaining quantitative tests, we estimated the fair value based on both the present value of future cash flows ("discounted cash flow method") and the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses. the discounted cash flow method requires us to make various assumptions regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows, including growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for a projection period, plus the terminal value of the business at the end of the projection period. the assumptions about future cash flows are based on our internal forecasts of the reporting unit, which incorporates our long-term business plans and historical trends. the terminal value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on historical and projected inflation and economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. a discount rate is determined for the reporting unit based on the risks of achieving the future cash flows, including risks applicable to the industry and market as a whole, as well as the capital structure of comparable entities. we utilized discount rates ranging from 9% to 13.5% and terminal values that were based on either growth rates ranging from 1% to 2% or revenue multiples ranging from 1.5x to 2.7x. traded and transaction values were determined using comparable company trading multiples as well as revenue and earnings multiples from recent transactions of comparable companies. the selected multiples consider each reporting unit's relative growth, profitability, size, and risk relative to the selected publicly traded companies. based on the results of these impairment tests, we concluded that the estimated fair values of the reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and, therefore, no impairment charge was required.
for one of the reporting units, we performed a qualitative assessment before and after the reporting unit change and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was higher than its carrying amount.
in the fourth quarter of 2022, as a result of a management reorganization, the reporting units within our tv media segment changed from three to two reporting units.
legal matters estimates of liabilities related to legal issues and predecessor operations, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. we record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. it is difficult to predict long-term future asbestos liabilities as events and circumstances may impact the estimate. the reasonably estimable period for our long-term asbestos liability is 10 years, which we determined in consultation with a third-party firm with expertise in estimating asbestos liability and is due to the inherent uncertainties in the tort litigation system. our estimated asbestos liability is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, and is assessed in consultation with the third-party firm. based on an assessment of these factors, during the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the accrual for asbestos matters by $23 million, which was recorded as a charge in "restructuring and other corporate matters" on the consolidated statement of operations. the increased accrual was primarily the result of a lower-than-expected rate of decline in new claims. changes in circumstances in future periods could cause our actual liabilities for asbestos and/or environmental matters to be higher or lower than our current accrual. we will continue to evaluate our estimates and update our accruals as needed.

pensions pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. the discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet our pension plans' expected future benefit payments, as determined for the accumulated benefit obligation. the expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. as of december 31, 2023, changes in actuarial assumptions resulted in an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss compared with the prior year-end due to a decrease in the discount rate, which was largely offset by the favorable performance of pension plan assets. a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would result in an estimated change to the accumulated benefit obligation of approximately $79 million and would have an insignificant impact on 2024 pension expense. a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $6 million to 2024 pension expense.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions.  when recording an interim worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results.  in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. while valuation allowances can require significant judgment, we believe the valuation allowance of $498 million at december 31, 2023 properly reduces our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
a number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. for positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, we evaluate each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated statement of operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. if a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. we evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors, including, changes in tax laws and interpretations, information received from tax authorities, and other changes in facts and circumstances. our income tax returns are routinely audited by u.s. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that the reserve for uncertain tax positions of $286 million at december 31, 2023 is properly recorded.

legal matters general on an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, "litigation''). litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. however, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the following matters are not likely, in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
stockholder matters litigation relating to the merger beginning in february 2020, three purported cbs stockholders filed separate derivative and/or putative class action lawsuits in the court of chancery of the state of delaware (the "delaware chancery court"). in march 2020, the delaware chancery court consolidated the three lawsuits and appointed bucks county employees retirement fund and international union of operating engineers of eastern pennsylvania and delaware as co-lead plaintiffs for the consolidated action captioned in re cbs corporation stockholder class action and derivative litigation (the "cbs litigation"). in april 2020, the lead plaintiffs filed a verified consolidated class action and derivative complaint (as used in this paragraph, the "complaint") against shari e. redstone, national amusements, inc., sumner m. redstone national amusements trust, additional members of the cbs board of directors (including candace k. beinecke, barbara m. byrne, gary l. countryman, linda m. griego, robert n. klieger, martha l. minow, susan schuman, frederick o. terrell and strauss zelnick), former cbs president and acting chief executive officer joseph ianniello and the company as nominal defendant. the complaint alleged breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the negotiation and approval of an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of august 13, 2019, between cbs and viacom (as amended, the "merger agreement"). the complaint also alleged waste and unjust enrichment in connection with certain aspects of mr. ianniello's compensation awards. the complaint sought unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. in december 2022, the delaware chancery court dismissed the fiduciary duty claim against mr. klieger.
in may 2023, the parties to the cbs litigation entered into a settlement agreement that provided for, among other things, the final dismissal of the cbs litigation in exchange for a settlement payment to the company in the amount of $167.5 million, less administrative costs and plaintiffs' counsels' fees and expenses. in september 2023, the delaware chancery court approved the settlement and dismissed the cbs litigation with prejudice. in october 2023, the company received the settlement payment in the amount of $120 million, which reflects the settlement of $167.5 million after a deduction was made for administrative costs and plaintiffs' counsels' fees and expenses, and accordingly, we recognized a gain of $120 million during the fourth quarter of 2023.
beginning in november 2019, four purported viacom stockholders filed separate putative class action lawsuits in the delaware chancery court. in january 2020, the delaware chancery court consolidated the four lawsuits. in february 2020, the delaware chancery court appointed california public employees' retirement system ("calpers") as lead plaintiff for the consolidated action. subsequently, in february 2020, calpers, together with park employees' and retirement board employees' annuity and benefit fund of chicago and louis m. wilen, filed a first amended verified class action complaint (as used in this paragraph, the "complaint") against nai, nai entertainment holdings llc, shari e. redstone, the members of the special transaction committee of the viacom board of directors (comprised of thomas j. may, judith a. mchale, ronald l. nelson and nicole seligman) and our president and chief executive officer and director, robert m. bakish (as used in this paragraph, the "viacom litigation"). the complaint alleged breaches of fiduciary duties to viacom ii-31

stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the merger agreement. the complaint sought unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. in december 2020, the delaware chancery court dismissed the claims against mr. bakish, while allowing the claims against the remaining defendants to proceed. in march 2023, the parties to the viacom litigation entered into a settlement agreement that provided for, among other things, the final dismissal of the viacom litigation in exchange for a settlement payment in the amount of $122.5 million, which has been fully paid. in july 2023, the delaware chancery court granted approval of the settlement and dismissed the viacom litigation with prejudice.
litigation related to stock offerings in august 2021, camelot event driven fund filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in new york supreme court, county of new york, and in november 2021, an amended complaint was filed that, among other changes, added an additional named plaintiff (as used in this paragraph, the "complaint"). the complaint is on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the company's class b common stock and 5.75% series a mandatory convertible preferred stock pursuant to public securities offerings completed in march 2021, and was filed against the company, certain senior executives, members of our board of directors, and the underwriters involved in the offerings. the complaint asserts violations of federal securities law and alleges that the offering documents contained material misstatements and omissions, including through an alleged failure to adequately disclose certain total return swap transactions involving archegos capital management referenced to our securities and related alleged risks to the company's stock price. in december 2021, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation seeking the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the outside director defendants from the lawsuit, which the court subsequently ordered. on the same date, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which were heard in january 2023. in february 2023, the court dismissed all claims against the company while allowing the claims against the underwriters to proceed. the plaintiffs and underwriter defendants have appealed the ruling.
litigation related to television station owners in september 2019, the company was added as a defendant in a multi-district putative class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois. the lawsuit was filed by parties that claim to have purchased broadcast television spot advertising beginning about january 2014 on television stations owned by one or more of the defendant television station owners and alleges the sharing of allegedly competitively sensitive information among such television stations in alleged violation of the sherman antitrust act. the action, which names the company among fourteen total defendants, seeks monetary damages, attorneys' fees, costs and interest as well as injunctions against the allegedly unlawful conduct. we reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. the settlement, which includes no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the company, was subject to court approval. in august 2023, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement, and in december 2023, the court granted final approval of the settlement.
claims related to former businesses asbestos we are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. we are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. in the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.

claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. we do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. as of december 31, 2023, we had pending approximately 19,970 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 21,580 as of december 31, 2022 and 27,770 as of december 31, 2021. during 2023, we received approximately 2,790 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 4,400 claims. we report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. our total costs for the years 2023 and 2022 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $54 million and $57 million, respectively. our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.
filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. a significant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. it is difficult to predict long-term future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate. we record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. the reasonably estimable period for our long-term asbestos liability is 10 years, which we determined in consultation with a third-party firm with expertise in estimating asbestos liability and is due to the inherent uncertainties in the tort litigation system. our estimated asbestos liability is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, and is assessed in consultation with the third-party firm. based on an assessment of these factors during the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the accrual for asbestos matters by $23 million, which was recorded as a charge in "restructuring and other corporate matters" on the consolidated statement of operations. the increased accrual was primarily the result of a lower-than-expected rate of decline in new claims. changes in circumstances in future periods could cause our actual liabilities to be higher or lower than our current accrual. we will continue to evaluate our estimates and update our accrual as needed.
other from time to time, we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. in addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors. while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods and, as a result, our actual liabilities may be higher or lower than our accrual.
market risk we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and use derivative financial instruments to manage this exposure. in accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

foreign exchange risk we conduct business in various countries outside the u.s., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the u.s. dollar. in order to hedge anticipated cash flows in currencies such as the british pound, the euro, the canadian dollar and the australian dollar, foreign currency forward contracts, for periods generally up to 24 months, are used. additionally, we designate forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions, including future production costs and programming obligations, as cash flow hedges. gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-u.s. dollar denominated cash flows. the change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in "other items, net" on the consolidated statements of operations. we manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.
at december 31, 2023 and 2022, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $2.72 billion and $3.06 billion, respectively. for 2023, $2.20 billion related to future production costs and $523 million related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows. for 2022, $2.40 billion related to future production costs and $655 million related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows.
interest risk interest rates on future long-term debt issuances are exposed to risk related to movements in long-term interest rates. interest rate hedges may be used to modify this exposure at our discretion. there were no interest rate hedges outstanding at december 31, 2023 or 2022 but in the future we may use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rates.
at december 31, 2023, the carrying value of our outstanding notes and debentures was $14.60 billion and the fair value was $13.6 billion. a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our notes and debentures by approximately $1.49 billion and $665 million, respectively.
credit risk we continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments. we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. however, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.
our receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at december 31, 2023 or 2022, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which our products and services are sold.

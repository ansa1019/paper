●   possible difficulty in selling apartment communities;

●   competitive factors that may limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents;

●   insufficient cash flow that could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk;

●   failure to generate sufficient revenue, which could impair our debt service payments and distributions to stockholders;

●   development and construction risks that may impact our profitability;

●   potential damage from natural disasters, including hurricanes and other weather-related events, which could result in substantial costs to us;

●   risks from climate change that impacts our properties or operations;

●   risks from extraordinary losses for which we may not have insurance or adequate reserves;

●   risks from cybersecurity breaches of our information technology systems and the information technology systems of our third party vendors and other third parties;

●   risks that third parties who have an interest in or are otherwise involved in projects in which we have an interest, including mezzanine borrowers, joint venture partners or other investors, do not perform as expected;

●   changing interest rates, which could increase interest costs and affect the market price of our securities;

●   potential liability for environmental contamination, which could result in substantial costs to us;

●   the imposition of federal taxes if we fail to qualify as a reit under the code in any taxable year;

●   our internal control over financial reporting may not be considered effective which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, and in turn have an adverse effect on our stock price; and

●   changes in real estate laws, tax laws, rent control or stabilization laws or other laws affecting our business.

a discussion of these and other factors affecting our business and prospects is set forth in part i, item 1a. risk factors. we encourage investors to review these risk factors.

business overview we are a self-administered real estate investment trust, or reit, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, disposes of, and manages multifamily apartment communities in targeted markets located in the united states. we were formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation. in june 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland. our subsidiaries include the operating partnership and the downreit partnership. unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to "we," "us," "our," "the company," or "udr" refer collectively to udr, inc., its consolidated subsidiaries and its consolidated joint ventures.
at december 31, 2023, our consolidated real estate portfolio included 168 communities in 13 states plus the district of columbia totaling 55,550 apartment homes. in addition, we have an ownership interest in 10,045 completed or to-be-completed apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships, including 5,618 apartment homes owned by entities in which we hold preferred equity investments. the same-store community apartment home population for the year ended december 31, 2023, was 51,368.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty. estimates are prepared based on management's assessment after considering all evidence available. changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of
39
operations. below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required. a discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in note 2, significant accounting policies, to the notes to the udr, inc. consolidated financial statements included in this report.
cost capitalization in conformity with gaap, we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset. expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred.
in addition to construction costs, we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment, development, and redevelopment of a capital project, which include, but are not limited to, interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects. we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the company ceases capitalization on the related portion. the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned, net of accumulated depreciation. amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $23.2 million, $31.3 million, and $21.0 million, respectively.
investment in unconsolidated entities we may enter into various joint venture agreements and/or partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting. we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement, applying the applicable accounting guidance. the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment. we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs. throughout our financial statements, and in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, we use the term "joint venture" or "partnership" when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100% ownership interest.
we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an other-than-temporary decline in value. we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. these factors include, but are not limited to, age of the venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders. the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment's carrying amount over its estimated fair value. if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary, no impairment is recorded. the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property. should the actual results differ from management's judgment, the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements.
impairment of long-lived assets quarterly or when changes in circumstances warrant, we will assess our real estate properties for indicators of impairment. the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on certain factors. such factors include, among other things, operational performance, market conditions, the company's intent and ability to hold the related asset, as well as any significant cost overruns on development properties.
if a real estate property has indicators of impairment, we assess whether the long-lived asset's carrying value exceeds the community's undiscounted future cash flows, which is representative of projected net operating income ("noi") plus the residual value of the community. our future cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. if such indicators of impairment are present and the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of the community, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates,
40
operating costs, growth rates, discount rates, capitalization rates, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.
for long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset. properties classified as real estate held for disposition generally represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted for sale with the closing expected to occur within the next twelve months. real estate held for disposition is carried at the lower of cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or fair value, less the cost to sell, determined on an asset-by-asset basis. expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on held for disposition properties are charged to expense as incurred. expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements related to held for disposition properties are capitalized at cost. depreciation is not recorded on real estate held for disposition.
real estate investment properties we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components, such as land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases, based on the fair value of each component. in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize various sources, including independent appraisals, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates. as such, the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial lease-up period. we determine the fair value of in-place leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. in addition, we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases, the foregone rents associated with the lease-up period, and the carrying costs associated with the lease-up period. the fair value of in-place leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period.
reit status we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit. a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than our net capital gain) to our stockholders. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years. based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31, 2023 in our consolidated statements of operations, we would have incurred federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit.

(a)   monthly income per occupied home represents total monthly revenues divided by the average physical number of occupied apartment homes in our same-store portfolio.

(b)   as of december 31, 2023, the company was developing two wholly owned communities with a total of 415 apartment homes, of which 56 have been completed.

(c)   the company had one community located in arlington, virginia that met the criteria to be classified as held for disposition at december 31, 2023.

we report in two segments: same-store communities and non-mature communities/other.
our same-store communities segment represents those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to january 1, 2022 and held as of december 31, 2023. these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the communities are not classified as held for disposition at year end. a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months.
42
our non-mature communities/other segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same-store communities, including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows, sales of properties, borrowings under our credit agreements, and/or the issuance of debt and/or equity securities. our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations, as determined by rental rates, occupancy levels, and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes, and borrowings under our credit agreements. we routinely use our working capital credit facility, our unsecured revolving credit facility and issuances of commercial paper to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longer-term financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities. during the past several years, proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we continue to execute on maintaining a diversified portfolio.
we expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements and our unsecured commercial paper program. we expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, the repayment of financing on development activities, and potential property acquisitions, through net cash provided by property operations, secured and unsecured borrowings, the issuance of debt or equity securities, and/or the disposition of properties. we believe that our net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements and our unsecured commercial paper program will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements. likewise, the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations, borrowings under credit agreements, the issuance of debt or equity securities, and/or dispositions of properties.
we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission, or "sec," which provides for the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, warrants, subscription rights, purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets. access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance.
in july 2021, the company entered into an atm sales agreement under which the company may offer and sell up to 20.0 million shares of its common stock, from time to time, to or through its sales agents and may enter into separate forward sales agreements to or through its forward purchasers. upon entering into the atm sales agreement, the company simultaneously terminated the sales agreement for its prior at-the-market equity offering program, which was entered into in july 2017. during the year ended december 31, 2023, the company did not sell any shares of common stock through its atm program. as of december 31, 2023, we had 14.0 million shares of common stock available for future issuance under the atm program.
in connection with any forward sales agreement under the company's atm program, the relevant forward purchasers will borrow from third parties and, through the relevant sales agent, acting in its role as forward seller, sell a number of shares of the company's common stock equal to the number of shares underlying the agreement. the company does not initially receive any proceeds from any sale of borrowed shares by the forward seller.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, the company repurchased 0.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $40.13 per share for total consideration of approximately $25.0 million under its share repurchase program.
future capital needs future development and redevelopment expenditures may be funded through unsecured or secured credit facilities, unsecured commercial paper, proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities, sales of properties, joint ventures, and, to a lesser extent, from cash flows provided by property operations. acquisition activity in strategic markets may be funded through joint ventures, by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties, through the issuance of equity or debt securities, the issuance of operating partnership units and the assumption or placement of secured and/or unsecured debt.
during 2024, we have approximately $97.6 million of secured debt maturing, inclusive of principal amortization, and $423.7 million of unsecured debt maturing. we anticipate repaying the debt due in 2024 with cash

flow from our operations, proceeds from debt or equity offerings, proceeds from dispositions of properties, or from borrowings under our credit agreements and our unsecured commercial paper program.

(a)   interest payments on variable rate debt instruments are based on each debt instrument's respective year-end interest rate at december 31, 2023.

(b)   for purposes of our ground lease contracts, the company uses the minimum lease payment, if stated in the agreement. for ground lease agreements where there is a rent reset provision based on fair market value or changes in the consumer price index but does not include a specified minimum lease payment, the company uses the current rent over the remainder of the lease term.

during 2023, we incurred gross interest costs of $191.0 million, of which $10.1 million was capitalized.
we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material.
guarantor subsidiary summarized financial information udr has certain outstanding debt securities that are guaranteed by the operating partnership. with respect to this debt, as further outlined below, the operating partnership fully and unconditionally guarantees payment of any principal, premium and interest in full to the holders thereof. the operating partnership is a subsidiary of udr, through which udr conducts a significant portion of its business and holds a substantial amount of its assets. udr also conducts business through other subsidiaries, including its taxable reit subsidiaries. in addition to its ownership interest in the operating partnership, udr holds interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures, owns and operates properties, issues securities from time to time and guarantees debt of certain of its subsidiaries. udr, as the sole general partner of the operating partnership, owns 100 percent of the operating partnership's general partnership interests and approximately 95 percent of its limited partnership interests and, by virtue thereof, has the ability to control all of the day-to-day operations of the operating partnership. udr has concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of, and therefore consolidates, the operating partnership.
the operating partnership is the subsidiary guarantor of certain of our registered debt securities, including the $300 million of medium-term notes due september 2026, $300 million of medium-term notes due july 2027, $300 million of medium-term notes due january 2028, $300 million of medium-term notes due january 2029, $600 million of medium-term notes due january 2030, $600 million of medium-term notes due august 2031, $400 million of medium-term notes due august 2032, $350 million of medium-term notes due march 2033, $300 million of medium-term notes due in june 2033 and $300 million of medium-term notes due november 2034.
the operating partnership fully and unconditionally guarantees payment of any principal, premium and interest in full to the holders of the notes described above. the guarantee forms part of the indenture under which the notes were issued. if, for any reason, we do not make any required payment in respect of the notes when due, the operating partnership will cause the payment to be made to, or to the order of, the applicable paying agent on behalf of the trustee. holders of the notes may enforce their rights under the guarantee directly against the operating partnership without first making a demand or taking action against udr or any other person or entity. the operating partnership may, without the consent of the holders of the notes, assume all of our rights and obligations under the notes and, upon such assumption, we will be released from our liabilities under the indenture and the notes.
44
the notes are udr's unsecured general obligations and rank equally with all of udr's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness outstanding from time to time. as a result, our payment of amounts due on the notes is subordinated to all of our existing and future secured obligations to the extent of the value of the collateral pledged toward any such secured obligation. our payment of amounts due on the notes also is effectively subordinated to all liabilities, whether secured or unsecured, of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries because, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding with respect to such subsidiaries, we, as an equity holder of such subsidiaries, would not receive distributions from such subsidiaries until claims of any creditors of such subsidiaries are satisfied.
the following tables present the summarized financial information for the operating partnership as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, and for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. the information presented below excludes eliminations necessary to arrive at the information on a consolidated basis (dollars in thousands):

statements of cash flows the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities, and net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.
operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2023, our net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities was $832.7 million compared to $820.1 million for 2022. the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net operating income ("noi"), primarily driven by higher revenue per occupied home, and noi from additional operating communities, partially offset by a decrease in operating distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures and changes in operating assets and liabilities.
45
investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2023, net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities was $(289.1) million compared to $(929.5) million for 2022. the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in acquisitions, an increase in proceeds from sales of real estate, a decrease in spend for development of real estate assets, and a decrease in cash investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, partially offset by an increase in spend for capital expenditures and a decrease in distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships.
acquisitions in february 2023, the company took title to a 136 apartment home operating community located in san francisco, california, through a foreclosure proceeding. the community was previously owned by a consolidated joint venture of the company. (see note 5, joint ventures and partnerships for more information).
in august 2023, the company acquired a portfolio of six operating communities totaling 1,753 apartment homes, which included four operating communities in dallas, texas and two operating communities in austin, texas, for a purchase price of $354.6 million. the company acquired the portfolio with a combination of cash, the assumption of six mortgage loans with an outstanding principal balance of approximately $209.4 million (fair value of $191.7 million), and the issuance of 3.6 million op units to the seller valued at $141.4 million. the op units were valued based on the closing price per share of udr's common stock on the date of acquisition in accordance with gaap. the company increased its real estate assets owned by approximately $344.8 million, recorded $9.8 million of in-place lease intangibles, and recorded a $17.6 million debt discount in connection with the below-market debt assumed.
in april 2022, the company acquired a to-be-developed parcel of land located in fort lauderdale, florida for approximately $16.0 million.
in june 2022, the company acquired a 433 apartment home operating community located in danvers, massachusetts for approximately $207.5 million. the company increased its real estate assets owned by approximately $203.7 million and recorded $3.8 million of in-place lease intangibles.
in june 2022, the company acquired three contiguous to-be-developed parcels of land located in dallas, texas for approximately $90.2 million.
in june 2022, the company acquired a to-be-developed parcel of land, which included two operating retail components, located in riverside, california for approximately $29.0 million. the company increased its real estate assets owned by approximately $28.2 million and recorded $0.8 million of in-place lease intangibles.
dispositions in january 2023, the company sold the retail component of a development community located in washington d.c. for gross proceeds of approximately $14.4 million, resulting in a gain of less than $0.1 million. the gross proceeds were received ratably throughout the development of the community and are reflected as a reduction of capital expenditures.
in june 2023, the company contributed four wholly owned operating communities, totaling 1,328 apartment homes located in various markets, to a newly formed joint venture in exchange for a 51.0% interest in the venture. the contribution resulted in the company no longer retaining a controlling interest in the communities, and the company deconsolidated the operating communities. the company received approximately $247.9 million in cash proceeds from our joint venture partner at formation. the transaction was accounted for as a partial sale and resulted in a gain of approximately $325.9 million, which was recorded in gain/(loss) on sale of real estate owned on the consolidated statement of operations, which consisted of the gain on the partial sale and the initial measurement of our retained interest at fair value. (see note 5, joint ventures and partnerships for further discussion.)
in december 2023, the company sold an operating community located in hillsboro, oregon with a total of 276 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $78.6 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $25.3 million.
in november 2022, the company sold an operating community located in orange county, california with a total of 90 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $41.5 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $25.5 million.
46
we plan to continue to pursue our strategy of exiting markets where long-term growth prospects are limited and redeploying capital to primary locations in markets we believe will provide the best investment returns.
capital expenditures we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset. expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, total capital expenditures of $303.7 million or $5,567 per stabilized home, which in aggregate include recurring capital expenditures and major renovations, were spent across our portfolio, excluding development, as compared to $234.0 million or $4,373 per stabilized home for the prior year.
the increase in total capital expenditures was primarily due to:
●   an increase of 46.7%, or $39.3 million, in major renovations, which includes major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings;

●   an increase of 25.6%, or $18.5 million, in noi enhancing improvements, such as kitchen and bath remodels and upgrades to common areas; and

●   an increase of 15.9%, or $11.8 million, in recurring capital expenditures, which includes asset preservation and turnover-related expenditures.

the following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities, excluding real estate under development, for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in thousands except per home amounts):

(a)   noi enhancing improvements are expenditures that result in increased income generation or decreased expense growth.

(b)   major renovations include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings.

(c)   total capital expenditures includes amounts capitalized during the year. cash paid for capital expenditures is impacted by the net change in related accruals.

(d)   average number of homes is calculated based on the number of homes outstanding at the end of each month.

we intend to continue to selectively add noi enhancing improvements, which we believe will provide a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital. our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also achieving cap rate compression through asset quality improvement.
consolidated real estate under development and redevelopment at december 31, 2023, our development pipeline consisted of two wholly-owned communities located in addison, texas and tampa, florida, totaling 415 homes, of which 56 have been completed, with a budget of $187.5 million, in which we have a gross carrying value of $160.4 million. the communities are estimated to be completed in the second quarter of 2024. during 2023, we incurred $159.3 million for development costs, a decrease of $38.7 million as compared to costs incurred in 2022 of $198.0 million.
47
at december 31, 2023, the company had no communities at which it was conducting substantial redevelopment activities.
unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships the company recognizes income or losses from our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships consisting of our proportionate share of the net income or losses of the joint ventures and partnerships. in addition, we may earn fees for providing management services to the communities held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships.
the company's investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships, net, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. for the year ended december 31, 2023:
●   we made cash investments totaling $71.4 million in our unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships;

●   our proportionate share of the net income/(loss) of the joint ventures and partnerships was $4.7 million, which included a $24.3 million loss due to the consolidation of one of our preferred equity investment joint venture (described below); and

●   we received cash distributions of $30.3 million, of which $15.9 million were operating cash flows and $14.4 million were investing cash flows.

we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an other-than-temporary decline in value. we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. the company did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairments in the value of its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.
financing activities for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities was $(538.9) million and $111.2 million, respectively.
the following significant financing activities occurred during the year ended december 31, 2023:
●   repurchased 0.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $40.13 per share for approximately $25.0 million;

●   received net proceeds of $108.1 million on our unsecured commercial paper program;

●   repaid $23.4 million on our revolving bank debt;

●   paid $35.6 million of distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interests; and

●   paid $539.9 million of distributions to our common stockholders.

the following significant financing activities occurred during the year ended december 31, 2022:
●   issued 11.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of $55.29 per share under forward sales agreements for aggregate net proceeds, after deducting related expenses, of approximately $629.6 million;

●   repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock at an average price of $41.14 per share for approximately $49.0 million;

●   received net proceeds of $80.0 million on our unsecured commercial paper program;

●   paid $34.3 million of distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interests; and

●   paid $483.6 million of distributions to our common stockholders.

credit facilities and commercial paper program the company has a $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility") and a $350.0 million unsecured term loan (the "term loan"). the credit agreement for these facilities ( the "credit agreement") allows the total commitments under the revolving credit facility and the total borrowings under the term loan to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to $2.5 billion, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from one or more lenders. the revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of january 31, 2026, with two six-month extension options, subject to certain conditions. the term loan has a scheduled maturity date of january 31, 2027.
based on the company's current credit rating, the revolving credit facility has an interest rate equal to adjusted sofr plus a margin of 75.5 basis points and a facility fee of 15 basis points, and the term loan has an interest rate equal to adjusted sofr plus a margin of 83.0 basis points. depending on the company's credit rating, the margin under the revolving credit facility ranges from 70 to 140 basis points, the facility fee ranges from 10 to 30 basis points, and the margin under the term loan ranges from 75 to 160 basis points. further, the credit agreement includes sustainability adjustments pursuant to which the applicable margin for the revolving credit facility and the term loan were reduced by two basis points upon the company receiving certain green building certifications, which is reflected in the margins noted above.
as of december 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, leaving $1.3 billion of unused capacity (excluding $2.3 million of letters of credit at december 31, 2023), and $350.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the term loan.
the company has a working capital credit facility, which provides for a $75.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the "working capital credit facility") with a scheduled maturity date of january 12, 2025. in november 2023, the company amended the working capital credit facility to extend the maturity date from january 12, 2024 to january 12, 2025, plus a one-year extension option. based on the company's current credit rating, the working capital credit facility has an interest rate equal to adjusted sofr plus a margin of 77.5 basis points. depending on the company's credit rating, the margin ranges from 70 to 140 basis points.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $4.6 million of outstanding borrowings under the working capital credit facility, leaving $70.4 million of unused capacity.
the bank revolving credit facilities and the term loan are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations, all of which we were in compliance with at december 31, 2023.
the company has an unsecured commercial paper program. under the terms of the program, the company may issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of $700.0 million. the notes are sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper market and rank pari passu with all of the company's other unsecured indebtedness. the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the operating partnership. as of december 31, 2023, we had issued $408.1 million of commercial paper, for one month terms, at a weighted average annualized rate of 5.7%, leaving $291.9 million of unused capacity.
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced. we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets and operations. interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities. our earnings are affected as changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. we had $479.7 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31, 2023. if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points, our interest expense would increase by $5.0 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year.
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. this analysis does not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment or actions we may take to further mitigate our exposure to the change. however, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure.
49
the company also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges. see note 14, derivatives and hedging activities, in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivative instruments.
a presentation of cash flow metrics based on gaap is as follows (dollars in thousands):

year ended december 31,

results of operations the following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.
net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders was $439.5 million ($1.34 per diluted share) for the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to $82.5 million ($0.26 per diluted share) for the prior year. the increase resulted primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report:
●   gains on the sale of real estate of $351.2 million from the partial sale of four operating communities located in various markets and the sale of an operating community located in hillsboro, oregon, during the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to a gain of $25.5 million from the sale of one operating community located in orange county, california, during the year ended december 31, 2022;

●   an increase in total property noi of $74.4 million primarily due to higher revenue per occupied home and noi from additional operating communities, partially offset by a decrease in weighted average physical occupancy and an increase in property operating expenses; and

●   an increase in interest income and other income/(expense), net of $24.7 million primarily due to realized and unrealized gains/(losses) of $3.5 million from our direct investment in smartrent during the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to $(15.7) million during the year ended december 31, 2022, and $11.0 million of higher interest income from our notes receivables, partially offset by a $5.9 million gain from the sale of a technology investment in 2022.

this was partially offset by:
●   an increase in net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the operating partnership and downreit partnership of $24.5 million primarily attributed to the noncontrolling interests' share of the gain from the partial sale of four operating communities located in various markets and an operating community located in hillsboro, oregon during the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the noncontrolling interests' share of the gain from the sale of an operating community located in orange county, california during the year ended december 31, 2022;

●   an increase in interest expense of $25.0 million primarily due to an increase in average interest rates and higher overall debt balances during the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared the year ended december 31, 2022; and

●   an increase in depreciation expense of $11.2 million primarily due to communities acquired and completion of developments in 2023 and 2022, partially offset by communities sold in 2023 and assets that became fully depreciated in 2023 and 2022.

apartment community operations our net income results are primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities. the company defines noi, which is a non-gaap financial measure, as rental income less direct property rental expenses. rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. excluded from noi is property management expense, which is calculated as 3.25% of property revenue, and land rent. property management expense covers costs directly related to consolidated property operations, inclusive of corporate management, regional supervision, accounting and other costs.
management considers noi a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community's continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporate-level expense allocations, general and administrative costs, capital structure and depreciation and amortization.
although the company considers noi a useful measure of operating performance, noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap. noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net income/(loss) attributable to udr, inc. below.
the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total property noi for each of the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

same-store communities our same-store community properties (those acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to january 1, 2022 and held on december 31, 2023) consisted of 51,368 apartment homes and provided 93.1% of our total noi for the year ended december 31, 2023.
noi for our same-store community properties increased 6.0%, or $58.8 million, for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. the increase in property noi was attributable to a 5.6%, or $79.3 million, increase in property rental income, which was partially offset by a 4.7%, or $20.5 million, increase in operating expenses. the increase in property rental income was primarily driven by a 6.1%, or $80.9 million, increase in rental rates, and a 6.4%, or $9.7 million, increase in reimbursement and ancillary and fee income, partially offset by a $4.9 million increase in bad debt based on probability of collection and a $3.4 million impact from higher concessions. weighted average physical occupancy decreased by 0.1% to 96.7% and total monthly income per occupied home increased 5.7% to $2,501.
the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 10.3%, or $8.3 million, increase in repair and maintenance expense due to an increase in the cost per home of those that were turned during the year, the impact of inflation on third party vendor costs, and weather-related events, a 10.6%, or $6.2 million, increase in utilities, which was primarily due an increase in energy costs, a 3.2%, or $5.7 million, increase in real estate taxes due to higher assessed valuations, and a 6.9%, or $2.0 million, increase in administrative and marketing expense, partially offset by a $2.5 million decrease in insurance expense primarily due to a decrease in the impact from claims.
the operating margin (property net operating income divided by property rental income) was 69.6% and 69.3% for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
non-mature communities/other udr's non-mature communities/other represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same-store communities, which include communities recently developed or acquired, redevelopment properties, sold or held for disposition properties, and non-apartment components of mixed use properties.
the remaining 6.9%, or $77.1 million, of our total noi during the year ended december 31, 2023 was generated from our non-mature communities/other. noi from non-mature communities/other increased by 25.3%, or $15.6 million, for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. the increase was primarily attributable to a $17.1 million increase in noi from stabilized, non-mature communities, primarily due to development communities completed in 2023 and 2022 and becoming stabilized, and a $3.5 million increase in non-
52
residential/other noi due to changes in straight-line rent as a result of a decrease in tenant rent concessions during 2023, partially offset by a $6.7 million decrease in sold and held for disposition communities noi due to the partial sale of four operating communities and the sale of one operating community in 2023, and one operating community held for disposition at december 31, 2023, as compared to the sale of one operating community in 2022.
real estate depreciation and amortization for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, the company recognized real estate depreciation and amortization of $676.4 million and $665.2 million, respectively. the increase in 2023 as compared to 2022 was primarily due to communities acquired and completions of developments in 2023 and 2022, partially offset by communities sold in 2023 and assets that became fully depreciated in 2023 and 2022.
gain/(loss) on sale of real estate owned during the year ended december 31, 2023, the company recognized a gain of $351.2 million from the partial sale of four operating communities located in various markets and the sale of an operating community located in hillsboro, oregon.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, the company recognized a gain of $25.5 million from the sale of one operating community located in orange county, california.
income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities during the year ended december 31, 2023, the company recognized income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities of $4.7 million, which was primarily due to net income from our operating joint ventures and preferred equity investments, partially offset by a $24.3 million loss on consolidation of one of our preferred equity investments.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, the company recognized income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities of $4.9 million, which was primarily due to net income from our operating joint ventures and preferred equity investments and $10.6 million of net variable upside participation recorded on the sale of a dcp community, partially offset by $(35.5) million of investment income/(loss) from retv i, which primarily related to unrealized gains/(losses) from one portfolio investment held by retv i, smartrent.
interest expense for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, the company recognized interest expense of $180.9 million and $155.9 million, respectively. the increase in 2023 as compared to 2022 was primarily due to an increase in average interest rates and higher overall debt balances during the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to 2022.
interest income and other income/(expense), net for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, the company recognized interest income and other income/(expense), net of $17.8 million and $(6.9) million, respectively. the increase of $24.7 million was primarily due to realized and unrealized gains/(losses) of $3.5 million from our direct investment in smartrent during the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to $(15.7) million during the year ended december 31, 2022, and $11.0 million of higher interest income from our notes receivables, partially offset by a $5.9 million gain from the sale of a technology investment in 2022.
noncontrolling interest for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, the company recognized net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the operating partnership and downreit partnership of $30.1 million and $5.6 million, respectively. the increase in 2023 as compared to 2022 was primarily attributed to the noncontrolling interests' share of the gains from the partial sale of four operating communities located in various markets and a gain form the sale of an operating community located in hillsboro, oregon during the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the noncontrolling interests' share of a gain from the sale of an operating community in orange county, california during the year ended december 31, 2022.
inflation
53
inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and repair and maintenance costs. in addition, inflation could also impact our general and administrative expenses, the interest on our debt if variable or refinanced in a high-inflationary environment, our cost of capital, and our cost of development, redevelopment, maintenance or other operating activities. however, the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less, which in an inflationary environment, and absent other factors such as increased supply, generally enables us to compensate for inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. although an extreme or sustained escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2023.
funds from operations, funds from operations as adjusted, and adjusted funds from operations funds from operations funds from operations ("ffo") attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate related to the main business of the company or of investments in non-consolidated investees that are directly attributable to decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee, gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate related to the main business of the company and income taxes directly associated with those gains and losses, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests, and the company's share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. this definition conforms with the national association of real estate investment trust's ("nareit") definition issued in april 2002 and restated in november 2018. historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. thus, nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of a reit's operating performance. in the computation of diluted ffo, if op units, downreit units, unvested restricted stock, unvested ltip units, stock options, and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive, they are included in the diluted share count.
management considers ffo a useful metric for investors as the company uses ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and its operating performance, and believes that ffo should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of the company's activities in accordance with gaap. ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs.
funds from operations as adjusted ffo as adjusted ("ffoa") attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as ffo excluding the impact of non-comparable items including, but not limited to, acquisition-related costs, prepayment costs/benefits associated with early debt retirement, impairment write-downs or gains and losses on sales of real estate or other assets incidental to the main business of the company and income taxes directly associated with those gains and losses, casualty-related expenses and recoveries, severance costs and legal and other costs.
management believes that ffoa is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and enables investors to more easily compare our operating results with other reits. ffoa is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. we believe that net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffoa. however, other reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffoa or similar ffo measures and, accordingly, our ffoa may not always be comparable to ffoa or similar ffo measures calculated by other reits. ffoa should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with gaap) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with gaap) as a measure of our liquidity.
adjusted funds from operations adjusted ffo ("affo") attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as ffoa less recurring capital expenditures on consolidated communities that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain
54
functionality at our communities. therefore, management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company's operational performance than ffo or ffoa.
affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. we believe that net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to affo. management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits, and presenting affo enables investors to assess our performance in comparison to other reits. however, other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and, accordingly, our affo may not always be comparable to affo calculated by other reits. affo should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss) (determined in accordance with gaap) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with gaap) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.

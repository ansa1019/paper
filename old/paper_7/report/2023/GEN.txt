•net revenues increased $474 million, primarily due to an additional five and a half months of revenue contribution from avast, up $419 million as compared to the corresponding period, which was acquired during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 in september 2022, and higher sales in both our consumer security and identity and information protection products, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.
•operating income (loss) decreased $105 million, primarily due to an increase in legal accrual related to ongoing litigation and an increase in amortization of intangible assets recognized as a result of our acquisition of avast. this is partially offset by the increase in net revenues discussed above and cost synergies post-acquisition.
•net income (loss) decreased $733 million and net income per share decreased $1.20, primarily due by the absence of the income tax benefit as a result of a tax capital loss in fiscal 2023, decreased operating income discussed above and increased interest expense associated with our senior credit facilities and two senior notes.
•cash and cash equivalents increased by $96 million compared to march 31, 2023, primarily due to cash generated from operating activities during fiscal 2024. this is offset by dividends paid to shareholders, voluntary prepayments of our term b facility, a mandatory principal amortization payment of our term a facility, and repurchases of our common stock.
•during fiscal 2024, we returned $1,947 million of capital back to shareholders and bondholders. this was achieved through the repurchase of 21 million shares of our common stock, totaling $441 million. additionally, we paid out a total of $323 million in quarterly dividends and carried out $1,183 million in debt pay downs, including $950 million in voluntary prepayments applied exclusively to the term b facility.
•during fiscal 2024, we increased net direct customers by 0.9 million, increased monthly direct arpu by $0.15, and increased our direct retention rate by 1%.
•during fiscal 2024, we received an $899 million income tax refund related to the filing of our fiscal 2023 tax return, which was recorded net of allowances as part of other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of march 31, 2023.
global macroeconomic conditions our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to inflation, changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to u.s. dollars, our reporting currency, changes in interest rates, as well as recession risks, any of which may persist for an extended period. additionally, our international results are impacted by the economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we operate and by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we conduct business in numerous currencies throughout our worldwide operations, and our entities hold monetary assets or liabilities, earn revenues, or incur costs in currencies other than the entity's functional currency. as a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange gains or losses, which impact our operating results. as part of our foreign currency risk mitigation strategy, we have entered into monthly foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency balance sheet exposure.
in addition, in early 2022, worldwide inflation began to increase. in response to the heightened levels of inflation, central banks, including the u.s. federal reserve and the european central bank, raised interest rates significantly in 2022, resulting in an increase in our cost of debt. although inflation rates slowed in 2023, global inflation remains high in 2024 and has impacted our results due to higher costs. volatile market conditions related to geopolitical conflicts and other macroeconomic events have, at times, affected our results of operations and cash flows in non-material ways; however, geopolitical conflicts and other macroeconomic events may in the future materially impact our results of operations and cash flows. due to our subscription-based business model, the effect of recent macroeconomic events may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods, if at all.
inflation, interest rates and foreign exchange rates remained volatile in 2023 and fluctuations in these indicators are uncertain and could result in further adverse impacts to our reported results. for a further discussion of the potential impacts of the global macroeconomic conditions on our business, please see "risk factors" in item 1a.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. requires us to make estimates, including judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we have based our estimates, judgements and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. we evaluate our estimates, judgements and assumptions on a regular basis and make changes accordingly. management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. making estimates, judgments and assumptions about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates, judgements or assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1, and a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and our expectation of the impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures are included in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. the allocation of purchase price requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets.
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships, developed technology, trade names, and discount rates. management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. third-party valuation specialists are utilized for certain estimates. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
income taxes we are subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. we are required to estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess the temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. we apply judgment in the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes which includes the following critical accounting estimates.
we use a two-step process to recognize liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. there is judgement and complexity involved in assessing if the tax position is more likely than not. if we determine that the tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various outcomes. we re-evaluate these unrecognized tax benefits on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period.
loss contingencies we are subject to contingencies that expose us to losses, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. we review the status of each significant matter quarterly, and we may revise our estimates. until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period.

fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023
net revenues increased $474 million, primarily due to a $388 million increase in sales of our consumer security products and a $88 million increase in sales of our identity and protection products. this was inclusive of $25 million of foreign exchange headwinds, primarily in our consumer security products and a $419 million increase from revenue contribution from avast due to the additional five and a half months as compared to the corresponding period.
performance metrics we regularly monitor a number of metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. we believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. our metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar metrics used by other companies.
the following table summarizes supplemental key performance metrics for our solutions:
fiscal year
(in millions, except for per user amounts and percentages)                 2024                        2023
direct customer revenue (1)                                          $3,353                      $2,933
partner revenues                                                       $396                        $341
total cyber safety revenues                                          $3,749                      $3,274
legacy revenues (2)                                                     $63                         $66
direct customer count (at quarter-end)                                 39.1                        38.2
direct average revenue per user (arpu) (3)                            $7.25                       $7.10
retention rate                                                           77   %                      76   %
(1)    non-gaap direct customer revenue differs from u.s. gaap direct customer revenue in fiscal 2023 because it excludes a $2 million, reduction of revenue from contract liability purchase accounting adjustments. we believe that eliminating the impact of this adjustment improves the comparability of revenues between periods. in addition, although the adjustment amounts will never be recognized in our u.s. gaap financial statements, we do not expect the acquisitions to affect the future renewal rates of revenues excluded by the adjustments.
(2)    legacy revenues includes revenues from products or solutions from markets that we have exited and in which we no longer operate, have been discontinued or identified to be discontinued, or remain in maintenance mode as a result of integration and product portfolio decisions.
(3)    due to the close of the acquisition of avast in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the fiscal 2023 arpu is based on the average arpu for the second, third, and fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, but excludes the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
we define direct customer count as active paid users of our products and solutions who have a direct billing and/or registration relationship with us at the end of the reported period. average direct customer count presents the average of the total number of direct customers at the beginning and end of the applicable period. we exclude users on free trials from our direct customer count. users who have indirectly purchased and/or registered for our products or solutions through partners are excluded unless such users convert or renew their subscription directly with us or sign up for a paid membership through our web stores or third-party app stores. the methodologies used to measure these metrics require judgment and are subject to change due to improvements or revisions to our methodology. from time to time, we review our metrics and may discover inaccuracies or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. we generally do not intend to update previously disclosed metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are deemed not material.
arpu is calculated as estimated direct customer revenues for the period divided by the average direct customer count for the same period, expressed as a monthly figure. non-gaap estimated direct customer revenues and arpu have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for u.s. gaap estimated direct customer revenues or other u.s. gaap measures. we monitor arpu because it helps us understand the rate at which we are monetizing our consumer customer base.
retention rate is defined as the percentage of direct customers as of the end of the period from one year ago who are still active as of the most recently completed fiscal period. we monitor the retention rate to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies to improve renewals of subscriptions.
net revenues by geographical region percentage of revenue by geographical region as presented below is based on the billing location of the customers.
fiscal year (1)
2024                                        2023
americas          65   %                  67   %
emea              24   %                  22   %
apj               11   %                  11   %
(1)    from time to time, changes in allocation methodologies cause changes to the revenue by geographic area above. when changes occur, we recast historical amounts to match the current methodology, such as for fiscal 2023 where we aligned allocation methodologies across similar product categories.
the americas include u.s., canada, and latin america; emea includes europe, middle east, and africa; apj includes asia pacific and japan.
while the percentage of revenue by geographic region in fiscal 2024 remains primarily in the americas, our acquisition of avast has expanded our presence in countries in the emea region.

fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023
our cost of revenues increased $142 million, primarily due to a $93 million increase in the amortization of acquired intangible assets, a $29 million increase in revenue share costs, and a $18 million increase in payment processing fees as a result of higher billings.
operating expenses fiscal year                      % change

our operating expenses increased in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 primarily due to an increase in legal accruals and amortization of intangible assets. this was partially offset by a decrease in transaction and integration costs, in connection with our acquisition of avast, which was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.
fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023
sales and marketing expense increased $51 million, due to a $32 million increase in advertising, a $9 million increase in occupancy and it costs, and an $8 million increase in headcount and outside services.
research and development expense increased $19 million, due to a $10 million increase in headcount and outside services and a $10 million increase in cloud hosting costs.
general and administrative expense increased $318 million, primarily due to a $388 million increase in legal accrual, of which $290 million is related to our litigation case with the trustees of columbia university in the city of new york (columbia) and the corresponding legal fees, $52 million related to a legal accrual in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and a $41 million reversal in legal accrual in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, both of which are related to the gsa litigation. this was partially offset by a $65 million decrease in acquisition and integration costs related to our acquisition of avast.
amortization of intangible assets increased $61 million as a result of the acquisition of avast.
restructuring and other costs decreased $12 million, primarily due a $10 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense. see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details of the fiscal 2024 restructuring activities.

fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023
non-operating income (expense), net, increased $240 million, primarily due to an increase in interest expense associated with borrowings under our senior credit facilities (as defined below) and two senior notes, which were issued during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, and a $33 million increase in loss on equity investments related to the impairment of one of our non-marketable equity investments.

fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023
our effective tax rate increased primarily due to a one-time income tax benefit as a result of a tax capital loss in fiscal 2023 partially offset by an income tax benefit as a result of an operational and legal entity restructuring in fiscal 2024. see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for information about our unrecognized tax benefits.
the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) and many countries have proposed to reallocate a portion of profits of large multinational enterprises (mne) with an annual global turnover exceeding €20 billion to markets where sales arise (pillar one), as well as enact a global minimum tax rate of at least 15% for mne with an annual global turnover exceeding €750 million (pillar two). on december 12, 2022, the european union reached an agreement to implement the pillar two directive of the oecd's reform of international taxation at the european union level. the agreement affirms that all member states must transpose the pillar two directive by december 31, 2023. the rules will therefore first be applicable for fiscal years starting on or after december 31, 2023. ireland, czech republic, and certain jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted legislation to implement pillar two and other countries are actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the oecd's proposals. the enactment of pillar two legislation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate and consolidated financial statements in the near term. we will continue to monitor and reflect the impact of such legislative changes in future consolidated financial statements as appropriate.
liquidity, capital resources and cash requirements liquidity and capital resources we have historically relied on cash generated from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, issuances of debt and proceeds from divestitures for our liquidity needs.
our capital allocation strategy is to balance driving stockholder returns, managing financial risk and preserving our flexibility to pursue strategic options, including acquisitions and mergers. historically, this has included a quarterly cash dividend, the repayment of debt and the repurchase of shares of our common stock.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under our revolving facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs, support on-going business activities and finance the expected synergy costs related to the acquisition of avast through at least the next 12 months and to meet our known long-term contractual obligations. we are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the next 12 months. however, our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those as of march 29, 2024 depending on several factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions; political climate; the expansion of sales and marketing activities; the costs to acquire or invest in businesses; and the risks and uncertainties discussed in "risk factors" in item 1a.
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activities in fiscal 2024 and 2023:

see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for our supplemental cash flow information.
cash from operating activities our cash flows provided by and used in operating activities in fiscal 2024 increased $1,307 million, primarily due to an income tax refund related to the filing of our fiscal 2023 tax return during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and cash collections from revenue attributable to our acquisition of avast during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.
cash from investing activities our cash flows provided by and used in investing activities in fiscal 2024 increased $6,549 million, primarily related to the absence of the total cash consideration paid for our acquisition of avast during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.
cash from financing activities our cash flows provided by and used in financing activities in fiscal 2024 decreased $6,642 million, primarily due to lower repayments of debt and repurchases of common stock under our repurchase program and by the absence of proceeds from the issuance of debt during the fiscal 2023.
fiscal 2024 reflects $1,183 million in voluntary prepayments and principal amortization payments of our term loans and mortgages and $441 million in repurchases of common stock. in contrast, fiscal 2023 reflects $8,954 million of aggregate proceeds: $3,910 million from term a facility, $3,690 million from term b facility, $900 million from the 6.75% senior notes and $600 million from the 7.125% senior notes, net of $146 million of debt issuance costs, offset by the $400 million repayment of our 3.95% senior notes, $1,010 million repayment of our initial term loan, $703 million repayment of our delayed draw term loan, the settlement of the $525 million principal and $100 million equity rights associated with our new 2.0% convertible notes, $250 million prepayment of our term b facility, and $59 million mandatory amortization payments of our term a and term b facility. repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2023 were $904 million.
cash and cash equivalents as of march 29, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $846 million, of which $379 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. our cash and cash equivalents are managed with the objective to preserve principal, maintain liquidity and generate investment returns. the participation exemption system under current u.s. federal tax regulations generally allows us to make distributions of non-u.s. earnings to the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. federal tax; however, these distributions may be subject to applicable state or non-u.s. taxes.
debt we have an undrawn revolving credit facility of $1,500 million, which expires in september 2027.
stock repurchases during the fiscal 2024 and 2023, we executed repurchases of 21 million and 40 million of our common stock under our existing stock repurchase program for an aggregate amount of $441 million and $904 million, respectively.
material cash requirements our principal cash requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support on-going business activities, including payment of taxes and cash dividends, payment of contractual obligations, funding capital expenditures, servicing existing debt, repurchasing shares of our common stock and investing in business acquisitions and mergers.
debt instruments as of march 29, 2024, our total outstanding principal amount of indebtedness is summarized as follows. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our debt.
(in millions)            march 29, 2024
term loans                $6,110
senior notes               2,600
mortgage loans                        6
total debt                $8,716
the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with specified financial ratios. as of march 29, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information regarding financial ratios and debt covenant compliance.
dividends on may 9, 2024, we announced a cash dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock to be paid in june 2024. any future dividends and dividend equivalents will be subject to the approval from our board of directors.
stock repurchase program under our stock repurchase program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock on the open market (including through trading plans intended to qualify under rule 10b5-1 under the exchange act) and through accelerated stock repurchase transactions. as of march 29, 2024, the remaining balance of our stock repurchase authorization is $429 million and does not have an expiration date. in may 2024, our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program through which we may repurchase shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $3 billion with no fixed expiration. this new stock repurchase program will supersede any amounts under the prior stock repurchase programs. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities.
restructuring in connection with the acquisition of avast, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan (the september 2022 plan) to realize cost savings and operational synergies, which became effective upon the close of the acquisition on september 12, 2022. we have incurred and expect to incur cash expenditures for severance and termination benefits, contract terminations, facilities closures, and the sale of underutilized facilities as well as stock-based compensation charges for accelerated equity awards for certain terminated employees. we expect that we will incur total costs up to $150 million following the completion of the acquisition. these actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2025. during fiscal 2024, we made $41 million in cash payments related to the september 2022 plan. see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further cash flow information associated with our restructuring activities.
significant contractual obligations the following is a schedule of our principal commitments as of march 29, 2024. the expected timing and amount of short-term and long-term payments of the obligations in the following table is estimated based on current information. timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for certain obligations.

(1)as of march 29, 2024, our total outstanding principal amount of indebtedness is comprised of $6,110 million in term loans, $2,600 million in senior notes and $6 million in mortgage loans. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information about our debt and debt covenants.
(2)interest payments calculated based on the contractual terms of the related debt instruments. interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate in effect as of march 29, 2024. interest on variable rate debt may vary based on the performance of our interest rate swaps. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the term loans and senior notes.
(3)agreements for purchases of goods or services, with terms that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. these amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment. the amounts under such contracts are included because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely, and we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials.
(4)transition tax payments on previously untaxed foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the tax cuts and jobs act, which may be paid through july 2025.
(5)payments for various non-cancelable operating lease agreements that expire on various dates through fiscal 2030. the amounts in the table above exclude expected sublease income. see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information on leases.
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits and other long-term taxes as of march 29, 2024, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. therefore, $1,346 million in long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the contractual obligations table. see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
indemnifications in the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners, subsidiaries, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, product warranties and losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us, including claims alleging that our software infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party. in addition, our bylaws contain indemnification obligations to our directors, officers, employees and agents, and we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers to give such directors and officers additional contractual assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in our bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections. we maintain director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers. refer to note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our indemnifications.

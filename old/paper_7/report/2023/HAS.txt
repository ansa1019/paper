2023 versus 2022
net revenues declined in all brand portfolios in 2023 compared to 2022.
franchise brands: the franchise brands portfolio net revenues decreased 3% in 2023 compared to 2022. the net revenue decrease primarily reflects lower net revenues from nerf products, lower net revenues from hasbro gaming products, lower net revenues from play-doh products compared to 2022, which benefited from the release of play-doh squished programming and to a lesser extent, lower net revenues from peppa pig products. these net revenue decreases were partially offset by net revenue increases from dungeons & dragons digital gaming products, most notably baldur's gate 3, the dungeons & dragons-based role-playing video game released during the third quarter 2023, as well as the theatrical release of dungeons & dragons: honor among thieves released in march 2023 and higher net revenues from d&d beyond, acquired during the second quarter of 2022. in addition, partially offsetting losses in the category were higher net revenues from transformers products, supported by the june 2023 theatrical release of transformers: rise of the beast, and to a lesser extent, higher net revenues from magic: the gathering products, most notably from sales of the lord of the rings: tales of middle-earth card set released in june 2023, making 2023 the second consecutive year that magic: the gathering has reached billion-dollar brand acclaim, reflecting ongoing fan enthusiasm for the brand, as well as higher net revenues from monopoly products reflecting the success of the mobile game monopoly go!, launched during the second quarter of 2023.
partner brands: the partner brands portfolio net revenues declined 35% in 2023 compared to 2022. within the partner brands portfolio, there are a number of brands which are reliant on related entertainment, including movie and television releases. as such, net revenues fluctuate from year-to-year by brand, depending on entertainment popularity, release dates and the success of related product line offerings. historically these entertainment-based brands experience higher revenues during years in which major films or television programming is released.
in 2023, partner brands net revenue declines were primarily driven by lower sales of the company's products for disney frozen and disney princess due to the expiration of the related license agreements in december 2022, lower net revenues from the company's products for marvel and star wars compared to 2022, which benefited from a robust slate of entertainment releases in 2022 as described below, without comparable releases in table of contents
2023, and to a lesser extent, lower net revenues from beyblade products. these decreases were partially offset by net revenue contributions from the introduction of the company's products for indiana jones, supported by the june 2023 theatrical release of indiana jones and the dial of destiny.
portfolio brands: the hasbro gaming portfolio net revenues declined 17% in 2023 compared to 2022 driven primarily by lower sales of furreal friends products and to a lesser extent, lower sales of pj masks, my little pony and baby alive products. these decreases were partially offset by net revenues from furby products following the company's successful reintroduction of the brand and refreshed product line during the second quarter of 2023, as well as higher net revenues from gi joe products.
non-hasbro branded film & tv: net revenues from the tv/film/entertainment portfolio declined 35% in 2023 compared to 2022. lower net revenues in 2023 were driven by lower scripted and unscripted television deliveries, as well as lower film deliveries in 2023 compared to 2022. these decreases were due primarily to the impact of the several months-long worker strikes by the writers guild of america and the american actors' union, sag-aftra, which disrupted the number and timing of planned program productions, most notably, rookie seasons five and six, rookie feds season two, the recruit season two, yellowjackets season three and cruel summer season three. in 2024, this category will be removed from the company's brand architecture. hasbro will continue to develop and produce animation, digital shorts, scripted tv and theatrical films for audiences related to core hasbro ip. all retained hasbro-branded content is included in the portfolios noted above.

net revenues declined in all brand portfolios in 2022 compared to 2021.
franchise brands: the franchise brands portfolio net revenues decreased 5% in 2022 compared to 2021. higher net revenues from magic: the gathering products, due to record sales from set releases that included: kamigawa: neon dynasty, commander legends: battle for baldur's gate, double masters, and others, reflecting momentum in the brand, and elevating magic: the gathering to the company's first billion-dollar brand. in addition, the franchise brands portfolio benefited from higher sales of peppa pig products, driven by the third quarter 2021 launch of the company's first line of peppa pig product line and higher sales of play-doh products. these net revenue increases were more than offset by lower net revenues from nerf products, lower sales of hasbro gaming products, most notably monopoly products, and to a lesser extent, lower net revenues from transformers products and lower net revenues from the dungeons & dragons: dark alliance digital game launched during the second quarter 2021 with no comparable release in 2022.
partner brands: the partner brands portfolio net revenues declined 9% in 2022 compared to 2021. in 2022, partner brands net revenue declines were driven by lower sales of the company's products for disney frozen and disney princess as the related license neared the end of its term, in addition to lower sales of beyblade products, and to a lesser extent, lower sales of ghostbusters products. these net revenue decreases were partially offset by higher net revenues from the company's products for marvel, led by momentum in the spider-man franchise which benefited from entertainment releases including the children's animated television series, marvel's spidey and his amazing friends as well as marvel studios' spider-man: no way home, released in december 2021. the company's products for marvel's avengers benefited from the release of marvel studios' doctor strange in the multiverse of madness in may 2022 and the july 2022 release of thor: love and thunder, while the company's products for black panther were supported by the november 2022 release of black panther: wakanda forever. to a lesser extent, net revenues from the company's line of star wars products increased as a result of continued star wars entertainment released on disney+.

non-hasbro branded film & tv: net revenues from the non-hasbro branded film & tv portfolio declined 17% in 2022 compared to 2021. lower net revenues in 2022 were driven by the sale of eone music during the third quarter of 2021, which represented $65.2 million or 6% of portfolio net revenues during 2021. in addition to the sale of eone music, net revenue declines in 2022 were driven by the lower number of film deliveries in 2022 compared to 2021 due to timing shifts of certain films into 2023, and to a lesser extent, lower unscripted television deliveries in 2022. these decreases were partially offset by higher net revenues from scripted production deliveries, most notably, cruel summer season two, the rookie seasons four and five and the rookie: feds season one.

cost of sales cost of sales primarily consists of purchased materials, labor, manufacturing overhead and other inventory-related costs such as obsolescence. cost of sales decreased 11% to $1,706.0 million, or 34.1% of net revenues, for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to $1,911.8 million, or 32.6% of net revenues, for the year ended december 25, 2022. in 2023, the cost of sales decrease was driven by lower sales volumes, primarily in north america and europe, and to a lesser extent asia pacific markets during 2023, and lower product input costs, most notably within the consumer products segment as well as cost savings realized from the company's operational excellence program combined with the impact of the exit of certain non-core business. these decreases were partially offset by higher closeout sales during 2023 compared to 2022. as a percent of net revenues, the cost of table of contents sales increase was primarily the result of higher inventory obsolescence charges, primarily within the consumer products segment, partially offset by the mix of net revenues during 2023 compared to 2022.
in 2022, cost of sales decreased 1% to $1,911.8 million, or 32.6% of net revenues, for the year ended december 25, 2022 compared to $1,927.5 million, or 30.0% of net revenues, for the year ended december 26, 2021. the cost of sales decrease in dollars was driven by lower sales volumes, primarily within the consumer products segment during 2022 compared to 2021. these decreases were partially offset by cost of sales increases within the wizards of the coast and digital gaming segment, reflecting higher tabletop gaming sales during 2022. the cost of sales increase as a percent of net revenues was the result of higher product input costs including higher material costs and higher inventory obsolescence, sales allowances and closeout charges to address excess inventory, most notably within europe and the u.s., partially offset by the benefit of implemented price increases and lower freight costs.
program cost amortization program cost amortization totaled $448.9 million, or 9.0% of net revenues in 2023, compared to $555.5 million, or 9.5% of net revenues in 2022 and $628.6 million, or 9.8% of net revenues, in 2021. the majority of the company's program costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method. the company also utilizes the percentage of completion methodology, primarily related to unscripted content. program cost amortization reflects both the phasing of revenues associated with films and television programming, as well as the type of content being produced and distributed. the program cost amortization decrease during 2023 reflects the impact of the writers' and actors' strikes during 2023, which disrupted the number and timing of planned productions and led to reduced deliveries during the year, in addition to an overall slowdown in production activity due to the sale of the eone film and tv business unit late in the fourth quarter of 2023. this decrease was partially offset by higher program cost amortization due to production asset impairment charges of $38.1 million associated with dungeons & dragons: honor among thieves, recorded during the second quarter of 2023 and higher program amortization costs attributable to certain other cancelled projects as a result of the company's go-forward brand strategy.
the program cost amortization decrease during 2022 was driven by the volume and mix of programming revenues compared to 2021, partially offset by $4.1 million of asset impairment charges recorded during 2022, related to discontinued projects associated with the exit of non-core business within the entertainment segment.
royalty expense royalty expense of $428.3 million, or 8.6% of net revenues, in 2023 compared to $493.0 million, or 8.4% of net revenues, in 2022 and $620.4 million, or 9.7% of net revenues, in 2021. fluctuations in royalty expense generally relate to the volume of entertainment-driven products sold in a given period, especially if the company is selling product tied to one or more major motion picture releases in the period. product lines related to hasbro-owned or controlled brands supported by entertainment generally do not incur the same level of royalty expense as licensed properties, particularly products for star wars and marvel properties and certain other licensed properties which carry higher royalty rates than other licensed properties. in 2023, the decrease in royalty expense was primarily due to lower sales of certain partner brands products which carry higher royalty rates, driven in part by the exit of certain license agreements in december 2022, combined with lower royalty expense associated with the eone film & tv business as a result of the slowdown in production activity described above. these decreases to royalty expense were partially offset by the impact of royalty rates associated with the 2023 card set releases, lord of the rings: tales of middle-earth and doctor who.
in 2022, the decrease in royalty expense was driven by lower sales of certain partner brands products which carry higher royalty rates and a change in product mix within the consumer products segment, and to a lesser extent, the mix of entertainment deliveries in 2022 reflecting lower film deliveries compared to 2021. in addition, lower royalty expense in 2022 reflects the impact of the sale of eone music during 2021 and the expiration of certain licensing agreements acquired through the eone acquisition, resulting in lower royalty expenses compared to prior periods. see note 20 to the company's consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8. financial statements, of this form 10-k for information on the company's future royalty commitments as of december 31, 2023.

the decrease in 2022 product development expense in dollars compared to 2021 was driven by lower spending in line with the company's global cost savings initiatives partially offset by higher spending in the wizards of the coast and digital gaming segment in support of the company's core initiatives.
advertising expense advertising expense in 2023 totaled $358.4 million, or 7.2% of net revenues, compared to $387.3 million or 6.6% of net revenues in 2022 and $506.6 million or 7.9% in 2021. the level of the company's advertising expense is generally impacted by revenue mix, the amount and type of theatrical releases and television programming delivered. the advertising expense decrease during 2023 was driven by lower expense within the consumer products segment, due to the volume and mix of product sales and timing of advertising expenditures during 2023, partially offset by higher expense within the entertainment and wizards of the coast and digital gaming segments, in support of the theatrical release of dungeons & dragons: honor among thieves and advertising costs associated with d&d beyond, acquired during the second quarter of 2022.
the advertising expense decrease during 2022 was driven by lower expense within the consumer products segment, reflecting the implementation of the company's strategic shift to focus on fewer, bigger brands and lower advertising expense in the entertainment segment related to the sale of the eone music business and a shift in the type of entertainment releases delivered in 2022. in 2021, higher advertising expense was driven by support for the september 2021 release of my little pony: a new generation and within the wizards of the coast and digital gaming segment, expense in support of the 2021 launch of the mobile version of magic: the gathering arena and dungeons & dragons: dark alliance, with no comparable releases in 2022.

the decrease in 2022 was the result of the discontinuation of amortization related to the eone music intangible assets following the sale of eone music during 2021. this decline was partially offset by additional expense associated with assets acquired through the d&d beyond acquisition during 2022.
impairment of goodwill in 2023, impairment of goodwill of $1,191.2 million, or 23.8% of net revenues represents non-cash impairment charges of $960.0 million associated with the company's family brands reporting unit recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting a reduced long-term forecast due to lower profitability of pj masks, and a change in outlook for the company's owned and operated production efforts that shifted the entertainment strategy to an asset lite and partner led model. in addition, $231.2 million of goodwill impairment charges recorded during the second quarter of 2023, related to the goodwill impairment of the company's film & tv reporting unit, due to the expected economic impact of industry factors. these charges were recorded within the entertainment segment. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, included in part ii, item 8. financial statements, of this form 10-k for additional information on impairment of goodwill.

prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased 38% in 2023 compared to 2022, driven primarily by lower accrued income balances and lower accrued tax credits for film and television production costs attributable to the eone film and tv business, sold during the fourth quarter of 2023. these decreases were partially offset by higher accrued royalty and licensing balances and higher prepaid income tax balances reflecting the reclassification of the company's 2023 transition tax liability installment payment due in april 2024, which is increasing to $45.9 million, from $34.4 million paid in 2023. in 2022, prepaid expenses and other current assets increased 3% driven by higher accrued royalty and licensing balances, primarily attributable to the company's entertainment business as well as the reclassification of certain accrued income balances from long-term to current. these increases were partially offset by lower prepaid royalty balances in relation to the company's marvel, power rangers and disney princess royalty agreements, the disposal of certain entertainment assets in relation to the exit of certain non-core businesses within the entertainment segment and from lower prepaid income tax balances during 2022.

accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased 20% in 2023 compared to 2022. the decrease was driven by lower accounts payable and accrued liability balances attributable to the eone film and tv business sold during the fourth quarter of 2023, including accrued participations, accrued expenses in relation to investments in film and table of contents television content and productions, and certain accounts payable balances that were included with the sale. in addition, the decrease to accounts payable and accrued liabilities was driven by lower accounts payable balances associated with the company's global cost savings initiatives and the timing of payments. these decreases were partially offset by higher accrued royalty balances associated with the company's digital gaming business, higher accrued income tax balances and higher incentive bonus accrual balances. accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased 14% in 2022 compared to 2021. the drivers of the decrease include lower accounts payable balances associated with the company's global cost savings initiatives and the timing of payments in 2022, lower incentive bonus accruals, lower accrued royalty balances as a result of partner brand product sales declines, lower accrued freight balances due to improving supply chain conditions within certain markets, as well as the disposal of certain entertainment liabilities in relation to the exit of non-core businesses within the entertainment segment. these decreases were partially offset by higher severance accrual balances related to certain cost savings initiatives mentioned above.
other liabilities decreased 19% in 2023 compared to 2022 reflecting lower lease liability balances and lower long-term deferred income tax balances associated with the eone film and tv business sold during the fourth quarter of 2023. in addition, the decrease in other liabilities was driven by a lower transition tax liability balance reflecting the reclassification of the 2023 installment payment due april 2024, and lower long-term deferred tax balances reflecting the amortization of deferred tax liabilities attributable to legacy hasbro businesses. these decreases were partially offset by a higher long-term lease liability balance attributable to a lease entered during the first nine months of 2023 in support of the wizards of the coast and digital gaming segment. other liabilities decreased 21% in 2022 compared to 2021. the decrease was driven by a lower transition tax liability balance reflecting the reclassification of the 2022 installment payment due april 2023, lower long-term lease liability balances, lower deferred tax balances reflecting the amortization of certain deferred tax liabilities and the impact of foreign exchange revaluation, primarily related to the british pound. these decreases were partially offset by an increase to the liability for uncertain tax positions, primarily related to the capitalization of research and experimentation expenditures.

critical accounting policies and significant estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. as such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. the critical accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company's reported financial results include film and television production costs, recoverability of goodwill, intangible assets, income taxes and business combinations. additionally, the company identified the valuation of the company's equity method investment in discovery family channel as a significant accounting estimate.
film and television production costs the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs and films which are capitalized as they are incurred, the majority of which are amortized using the individual-film-forecast method. these costs, which include direct production costs, development costs, acquisition and inventory costs as well as residuals and participations, are amortized in the proportion that the current year's revenues bear to management's estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the film or television program. these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value, and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that impairment may exist. the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on management's future revenue and cost estimates.
the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individual-film-forecast method. ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to a film or television program and include theatrical exhibition; first run program distribution fees; toy, game and other consumer product licensing fees; and other revenue sources, such as secondary market home entertainment formats and subscription video on demand services. our ultimate revenue estimates for each film or television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results. we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. when estimates for a film or television program are revised, the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year, are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the estimates are revised. prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates. factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the historical performance of similar films and television programs, expected distribution platforms, factors unique to our television and film content and the success of our program-related toy, game and other merchandise.
recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually. if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the company will perform an interim goodwill impairment test at that time. the company may perform a qualitative assessment and bypass the quantitative impairment testing process, if it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
if it is more likely than not the carrying value exceeds its fair value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. when performing a quantitative impairment test, goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the table of contents carrying value to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit which is calculated using an income approach and market approach. other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value.

the estimation of future cash flows utilized in the evaluation of the company's goodwill requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. see note 6 to the company's consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8. financial statements, of this form 10-k for more information on the company's goodwill.

table of contents during the fourth quarter of 2022, following the decision to cancel certain projects in conjunction with the company's strategic shift, it was determined that there was a partial impairment of the company's definite-lived power rangers intangible asset. as a result of these cancelled projects, changes to anticipated revenues and related cash flows led to the determination that carrying values of these intangible assets exceeded their related estimated future cash flows, thus indicating impairment. as a result, charges of $281.0 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 within selling, distribution and administration within the corporate and other segment.
there were no other triggering events in 2023, 2022 or 2021 which would indicate the company's intangible assets were impaired.
income taxes the company's annual income tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates, changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the company's annual tax rate and evaluate its tax positions. despite the company's belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable, these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established to account for events in which these positions are challenged, and the company is not successful in defending those challenges. these estimated liabilities, as well as the related interest, are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit.

financial risk management the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in u.s. dollars, hong kong dollars and euros while marketing and selling those products in more than twenty currencies. results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the u.s. dollar, euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, brazilian real, and mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, other currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries.
to manage this exposure, the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts. at december 31, 2023, the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation of the u.s. dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate $16.6 million decrease in the fair value of these instruments. a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be offset by increases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions.
the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term borrowing positions in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company believes, however, that the on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. in addition, the company's revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the company's revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign-denominated revenues and expenses. the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange. from time to time, affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts.
the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets. the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. at december 31, 2023, these contracts had net unrealized losses of $3.2 million, of which $0.7 million are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, $3.9 million are recorded in accrued liabilities. included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 31, 2023 are deferred losses of $2.5 million, net of tax, related to these derivatives.
at december 31, 2023, the company had fixed rate long-term debt of $3,484.9 million. in may 2014, the company issued an aggregate $600.0 million of long-term debt which consisted of $300.0 million of 3.15% notes, subsequently repaid in 2021, and $300.0 million of 5.10% notes due 2044. prior to the may 2014 debt issuance, the company entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of $500.0 million to hedge the anticipated underlying u.s. treasury interest rate. these interest rate swaps were matched with this debt issuance and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in future interest payments. at the date of issuance, the company terminated these swap agreements and their fair value at the date of issuance was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method over the life of the related debt. included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 31, 2023 are deferred losses, net of tax, of $14.2 million related to these derivatives.
industry trends, the economy and inflation the principal market for the company's toys and games and licensed consumer products, is the retail sector. revenues from the company's top five retail customers, accounted for approximately 34% of its consolidated net revenues in 2023, 35% in 2022 and 36% of its consolidated net revenues in 2021. the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate.
the company's revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. in 2023, approximately 56% of the company's full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year. the company expects that this concentration will continue. the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items, and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of table of contents retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season, which includes christmas.
quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers as well as growth in ecommerce result in orders increasingly placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders placed well in advance of shipment. retailers are timing their orders so that they are filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers. to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the company's future revenues. in 2023, the company's inventory levels decreased 51% compared to 2022. this decrease reflects company-wide efforts to reduce retail inventory levels, while improving the quality of inventory on hand. inventory management efforts included inventory scrap and obsolescence write-downs for excess or obsolete inventory as the company looks toward 2024. inventories increased 23% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily reflecting accelerated inventory purchases attributable to the company's consumer products and wizards of the coast businesses, to mitigate the impact of certain global supply chain challenges experienced in 2021. however, as global supply chain constraints began to subside later in 2022, the company experienced lower than anticipated consumer products sales, resulting in higher inventory levels. the company is continuing to manage inventory levels through closeout sales where needed and by monitoring consumer purchase patterns to ensure adequate supply of new product while clearing excess supply to mitigate the risk of inventory obsolescence.
in addition to these inventory management challenges, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company's significant retailers could negatively impact the company's future revenues.
unlike the company's retail sales patterns, revenue patterns from the company's entertainment businesses fluctuate based on the timing and popularity of content releases. release dates are determined by factors including the timing of holiday periods, geographical release dates and competition in the market. in addition, entertainment business operating results fluctuate due to expenses recorded in relation to productions and content such as program amortization costs and advertising expenses, which are incurred and recognized, beginning prior to initial releases and then continue throughout the related distribution windows.
inflation the impact of inflation on the company's business operations was significant during 2022 and 2023. the company monitors the impact of inflation to its business operations on an ongoing basis and may need to implement actions such as price adjustments to mitigate the impact of changes to the rate of inflation in future periods. however, future volatility of general price inflation could affect consumer purchases of our products and spending on entertainment. additionally, the impact of inflation on costs and availability of materials, costs for shipping and warehousing and other operational overhead, could adversely affect the company's financial results.
other information the company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position.

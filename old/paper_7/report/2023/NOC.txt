item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read along with the financial statements included in this form 10-k, as well as part ii, "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022 ("2022 annual report on form 10-k").
global security environment the u.s. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors, including in particular major global powers, as well as terrorist organizations, increasing nuclear tensions, diverse regional security concerns and political instability. the market for defense products, services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges, considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic circumstances and priorities. our operations and financial performance, as well as demand for our products and services, are impacted by global events, including violence and unrest. the same is true for our suppliers and other business partners.
the conflict in ukraine has increased global tensions and instability, highlighted threats and increased global demand, as well as further disrupted global supply chains. we continue to not anticipate significant adverse financial impacts directly from the ongoing conflict. we have experienced, and, while difficult to predict, may continue to experience a modest increase in demand for certain of our goods and services directly and indirectly related to the conflict in ukraine, either through direct sales or if the u.s. provides increased military assistance and support to ukraine.
more recently, the hostilities in israel and the gaza strip have further heightened global tensions and instability. at this time, it is unknown whether hostilities in this region will escalate into an even larger conflict. the demand for our goods and services may increase, especially if the u.s. provides increased military assistance and support to israel. we do not have a significant business presence in the region, and therefore do not anticipate significant adverse financial impacts directly from the current conflict.
more broadly, the ongoing conflicts in ukraine and israel and threats elsewhere, particularly in the pacific region, have heightened tensions and highlighted security requirements globally, including europe, the middle east and the pacific region, as well as the u.s. these conflicts may result in increased demand for defense products and services from allies and partner nations, particularly in those areas. we are actively exploring both opportunities and risks associated with the broader global security environment.
we believe the current global security environment highlights the significant national security threats to the u.s. and its allies, and the need for strong deterrence and a robust defense capability. we believe our capabilities, particularly in space, c4isr, missile defense, battle management, advanced weapons, and survivable aircraft and mission systems should help our customers in the u.s. and globally defend against current and future threats and, as a result, continue to allow for long-term profitable business growth.
global economic environment the global economic environment has experienced extraordinary challenges, including high rates of inflation and inflationary pressures; widespread delays and disruptions in supply chains; business slowdowns or shutdowns; workforce challenges and labor shortfalls; and market volatility. some of these challenges were due, in part, to the global health emergency caused by covid-19, which the world health organization declared ended in may 2023. direct impacts of covid-19 on our business during 2023 were limited, and we are not currently expecting significant direct impacts on our business going forward.
the macroeconomic factors have contributed, and we expect will continue to contribute, to increased costs, delays, disruptions and other performance challenges, as well as increased competing demands for limited resources to address such increased costs and other challenges, for our company, our suppliers and partners, and our customers.
we continue to work hard to mitigate challenges caused by the current macroeconomic environment on our business, including by taking steps to support our suppliers and small businesses and enhancing our workforce through extensive hiring, development and retention efforts. however, the broader macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges, continued adversely to affect the company's results for the year ended december 31, 2023. we cannot clearly predict how long these macroeconomic challenges will continue, how they will change over time, or what additional resources will be available, but we expect to see this challenging macroeconomic environment continue adversely to impact the global economy, our customers and suppliers, our industry and our company in 2024.

northrop grumman corporation in addition, increased interest rates, raising the cost of borrowing for governments, could further impact government spending priorities (in the u.s. and allied countries, in particular), including their demand for defense products. economic tensions and changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements, could also further impact the global market for defense products, services and solutions.
u.s. political, budget and regulatory environment the u.s. continues to face an uncertain and evolving political, budget and regulatory environment. in particular, it is difficult to predict the specific course of future defense budgets. current and future requirements related to the conflicts in ukraine and israel, threats in the pacific regions and other security priorities, as well as global inflation, the national debt, and other domestic priorities, among other things, in the u.s. and globally, will continue to impact our customers' budgets, spending and priorities, and our industry. the u.s. political environment, including the u.s. election cycle, may also impact defense budgets and priorities, issues related to the national debt, and government spending more broadly. we anticipate that issues related to budgetary priorities and defense spending levels, the debt ceiling, and the spending caps imposed by the fiscal responsibility act of 2023 (fra), particularly with respect to discretionary spending, will continue to be a subject of considerable debate, with a potentially significant impact on our programs and the company.
annual appropriations to fund the federal government for fy 2024 have not been enacted. congress continues to pass short-term continuing resolutions (cr) to fund the federal government. the most recent "laddered" cr passed in january 2024 funds the government through march 2024, depending on the appropriation bill. if congress does not pass full year appropriations or an additional cr before current funding expires, the federal government (or select departments) could face a shutdown and cease what are characterized as certain non-essential operations. depending on the nature and duration of a potential shutdown, businesses that rely on government funding, including defense contractors, could be significantly impacted. if the federal government remains under a cr at the end of april 2024, the one percent discretionary spending cuts under the fra could be triggered, potentially resulting in lower funding on the programs in which we participate.
in december 2023, the president signed the national defense authorization act (ndaa) for fy 2024 which supports approximately $886 billion in fy 2024 funding for national defense, $842 billion of which is for the dod.
the political environment, federal budget, debt ceiling and regulatory environment are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate, especially in light of the ongoing conflicts and heightened global tensions, the inflationary environment and political tensions. the results of those debates could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and the company's programs in particular. we anticipate that the broader macroeconomic environment, with ongoing inflationary pressures, pockets of labor challenges, and supply chain disruption, among other considerations, will continue to play a significant role in the outcome of these debates and, in turn, on our industry and company.

ground-based strategic deterrent ("gbsd" or "sentinel") program nunn-mccurdy breach review due in part to the impact of macroeconomic factors, in january 2024 the customer provided congressional notification that the sentinel program is currently under a nunn-mccurdy breach review, which is required when total program cost estimates exceed certain defined thresholds. this notification, which has been driven primarily by increases in construction and procurement cost projections for the production and deployment phases, commences the process to achieve recertification for continuance of the program and update its baseline cost estimates. we are currently executing under a cost-type contract for the engineering and manufacturing development phase, and the production and deployment phases are yet to be priced and negotiated. we are continuing to partner with our customer to address this critical mission. for more information, see "risk factors".
disposition of it and mission support services business effective january 30, 2021 (the "divestiture date"), we completed the sale of our it and mission support services business (the "it services divestiture") for $3.4 billion in cash and recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.0 billion. the it and mission support services business was comprised of the majority of the former information solutions and services (is&s) division of defense systems (excluding the vinnell arabia business); select cyber, intelligence and missions support programs, which were part of the former cyber and intelligence mission solutions (cims) division of mission systems; and the former space technical services business unit of space systems. operating results include sales and operating income for the it and mission support services business prior to the divestiture

northrop grumman corporation date; therefore, no sales and operating income were recognized for this business during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022. the company recorded sales of $162 million and pre-tax profit of $20 million for the it and mission support services business during the year ended december 31, 2021.
operating performance assessment and reporting we manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs (typically larger contracts or two or more closely-related contracts). we recognize sales from our portfolio of long-term contracts as control is transferred to the customer, primarily over time on a cost-to-cost basis (cost incurred relative to costs estimated at completion). as a result, sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred across our large portfolio of contracts. due to the applicable far and cas requirements that govern our u.s. government business, most types of costs are allocable to u.s. government contracts. as such, we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as manufacturing, engineering and design labor, subcontractor, material, overhead and general and administrative (g&a) costs), as much as we do on total contract cost, which is the key driver of our sales and operating income.
in evaluating our operating performance, we primarily focus on changes in sales and operating margin rates. where applicable, significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs, or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts, are described in our analysis. based on this approach and the nature of our operations, the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services. changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume, while changes in operating margin rates are generally described in terms of performance and/or contract mix. for purposes of this discussion, volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from production/service activity levels and performance generally refers to non-volume-related changes in profitability, which are typically described in terms of changes in net eac adjustments. contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type and/or life cycle (e.g., cost-type, fixed-price, development, production, and/or sustainment).
consolidated operating results for purposes of the operating results discussion below, we assess our performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap" or "fas").
mark-to-market adjusted net earnings (mtm-adjusted net earnings) and mtm-adjusted earnings per share (mtm-adjusted eps) exclude mtm pension and opb (expense)/benefit and related tax impacts, which are generally only recognized during the fourth quarter. transaction-adjusted net earnings and transaction-adjusted earnings per share (transaction-adjusted eps) exclude the mtm impacts noted above, as well as impacts related to the it services divestiture, including the gain on sale of the business, associated federal and state income tax expenses, transaction costs, and the make-whole premium for early debt redemption. these non-gaap measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company's underlying financial performance by presenting the company's operating results before the non-operational impact of pension and opb actuarial gains and losses, and with regard to transaction-adjusted net earnings and eps, the impact of certain divestiture activity. these measures are also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of mtm accounting and the it services divestiture are not considered in management's assessment of the company's operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards.
we reconcile these non-gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures below. these non-gaap measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap.

sales
2023 sales increased $2.7 billion, or 7 percent, due to higher sales at all four sectors. 2023 sales reflect continued strong demand for our products and services.
see "segment operating results" below for further information by segment and "product and service analysis" for product and service detail. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region for each of our segments.
operating income and margin rate
2023 operating income decreased $1.1 billion, or 30 percent, primarily due to a $1.56 billion charge on the b-21 program at aeronautics systems, partially offset by higher operating income at space systems and defense systems. the b-21 charge relates to the low-rate initial production (lrip) phase of the program and is due principally to a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. the decrease was also offset by $311 million of lower unallocated corporate expense, largely due to higher deferred state tax benefits associated with the mtm adjustment and b-21 charge and lower intangible asset amortization and pp&e step-up depreciation, as well as a $118 million reduction in the fas/cas operating adjustment. 2023 operating margin rate declined to 6.5 percent from 9.8 percent reflecting the items above.
2023 g&a costs as a percentage of sales decreased to 10.2 percent from 10.6 percent, primarily due to higher sales, which more than offset our continued investments for future business opportunities.

northrop grumman corporation the 2023 mtm expense of $422 million was primarily driven by a 39 basis point decrease in the discount rate from year end 2022, partially offset by actual net plan asset returns of 11.1 percent compared to our 7.5 percent asset return assumption.
federal and foreign income taxes the 2023 effective tax rate (etr) decreased to 12.4 percent from 16.1 percent in 2022 primarily due to lower earnings before income taxes as a result of the b-21 charge and mtm expense, which collectively reduced the 2023 etr by 3.8 percentage points. the 2022 mtm benefit increased the 2022 etr by 1.2 percentage points. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

(1)the deferred state tax impact in each period was calculated using the company's blended state tax rate of 5.25 percent and is included in unallocated corporate expense within operating income.
(2)the federal tax impact in each period was calculated by subtracting the deferred state tax impact from mtm benefit (expense) and applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate.
(3)the state tax impact includes $62 million of incremental tax expense related to $1.2 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business.
(4)the federal tax impact was calculated by applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate to the adjustment items and also includes $250 million of incremental tax expense related to $1.2 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business.
2023 net earnings decreased $2.8 billion, or 58 percent, principally due to a $1.7 billion decrease in our mtm (expense) benefit, a $975 million reduction in the non-operating fas pension benefit and the $1.1 billion decrease in operating income described above, partially offset by a $650 million decrease in income tax expense, a $107 million increase in returns on marketable securities related to our non-qualified benefit plans, and a $97 million gain recognized upon the sale of our minority investment in an australian business.

segment operating results basis of presentation the company is aligned in four operating sectors, which also comprise our reportable segments: aeronautics systems, defense systems, mission systems and space systems. for a more complete description of each segment's products and services, see "business."
segment operating income and margin rate segment operating income, as reconciled in the table below, and segment operating margin rate (segment operating income divided by sales) are non-gaap measures that reflect the combined operating income of our four segments less the operating income associated with intersegment sales. segment operating income includes pension expense allocated to our sectors under far and cas and excludes fas pension service expense and unallocated corporate items (certain corporate-level expenses, which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable far and cas requirements, and costs not considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating performance). these non-gaap measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. these measures may not be

(1)represents the deferred state tax (benefits) expenses associated with mtm (expense) benefit and the b-21 charge, which are recorded in unallocated corporate expense (income) consistent with other changes in deferred state taxes.
segment operating income and margin rate
2023 segment operating income decreased $1.5 billion, or 35 percent, and segment operating margin rate decreased to 7.0 percent primarily due to the b-21 charge at aeronautics systems. operating income at space systems and defense systems was higher than in the prior year period.
fas/cas operating adjustment the decrease in our 2023 fas/cas operating adjustment is primarily due to lower fas pension service expense resulting from changes in certain actuarial assumptions as of december 31, 2022.
unallocated corporate expense (income)
the decrease in 2023 unallocated corporate expense is primarily due to higher deferred state tax benefits associated with the mtm adjustment and b-21 charge and lower intangible asset amortization and pp&e step-up depreciation.

sales
2023 sales increased $255 million, or 2 percent, primarily due to higher volume on restricted programs, partially offset by a $191 million decrease on the f/a-18 program largely due to post multi-year procurement 4 (myp4) contract award timing, a $131 million decrease on the joint surveillance and target attack radar system (jstars) program as that program nears completion and a decrease on the e-2 program largely related to higher material volume in the prior year.
operating income
2023 operating income decreased $1.6 billion and operating margin rate decreased to (4.4) percent primarily due to the previously described $1.56 billion charge recorded on the lrip phase of the b-21 program, inclusive of a $143 million unfavorable eac adjustment for the first lrip lot. the prior year period includes $133 million of favorable eac adjustments on the engineering, manufacturing and development phase of the b-21 program and a $38 million gain on a property sale. apart from the b-21 eac adjustments noted above, net eac adjustments across the sector were $58 million higher than in the prior year.

northrop grumman corporation sales
2023 sales increased $283 million, or 5 percent, primarily due to higher volume on several programs, including ammunition programs, guided multiple launch rocket system (gmlrs), an international training program, hypersonic attack cruise missile (hacm), and stand-in attack weapon (siaw).
operating income
2023 operating income increased $46 million, or 7 percent, due to higher sales and a higher operating margin rate. operating margin rate increased to 12.1 percent from 11.9 percent primarily due to the write-down of an unconsolidated joint venture investment in the prior year.

sales
2023 sales increased $499 million, or 5 percent, primarily due to higher restricted sales on advanced microelectronics programs, as well as a $165 million increase on marine systems programs. these increases were partially offset by a $107 million decrease on the ground/air task oriented radar (g/ator) program largely driven by the timing of material receipts and full-rate production (frp) 5 contract award, as well as lower volume on airborne radar programs.
operating income
2023 operating income decreased $9 million, or 1 percent, due to a lower operating margin rate, which more than offset higher sales. operating margin rate decreased to 14.8 percent from 15.6 percent primarily due to a prior year $33 million benefit recognized in connection with a contract-related legal matter, as well as changes in contract mix toward more cost-type content.

sales
2023 sales increased $1.7 billion, or 14 percent, primarily due to higher volume on restricted programs and ramp-up on development programs, including increases of $426 million on the ground based strategic deterrent (gbsd) program, $333 million on the next-generation overhead persistent infrared polar (nextgen polar) program, $219 million on the next generation interceptor (ngi) program, $119 million on the space development agency (sda) tranche 1 tracking layer program and $102 million on the sda tranche 2 transport layer program. these increases were partially offset by a $172 million decrease for commercial resupply services (crs) missions and a $109 million decrease on the habitation and logistics outpost (halo) program.

northrop grumman corporation operating income
2023 operating income increased $54 million, or 5 percent, due to higher sales, partially offset by a lower operating margin rate. operating margin rate decreased to 8.7 percent from 9.4 percent primarily due to a prior year $96 million gain recognized in connection with a land exchange transaction, as well as lower net eac adjustments driven by $100 million of unfavorable eac adjustments on the halo program in 2023. these decreases were partially offset by a $42 million benefit from insurance recoveries in our commercial space business during 2023.

product sales and costs
2023 product sales increased $2.4 billion, or 8 percent, due to an increase in product sales at all four sectors. the increase was principally driven by higher volume on restricted programs, gbsd and ngi at space systems, higher restricted sales at mission systems and aeronautics systems, and higher volume on ammunition programs, gmlrs, ibcs and hacm at defense systems.
2023 product costs increased $4.0 billion, or 16 percent, consistent with the higher product sales described above and reflect a lower operating margin rate principally due to the previously described $1.56 billion charge on the b-21 program at aeronautics systems and lower net eac adjustments on space systems production programs.
service sales and costs
2023 service sales increased $313 million, or 4 percent, due to an increase in service sales at all four sectors. the increase was principally driven by higher restricted sales at space systems and aeronautics systems, higher volume on restricted programs and f-35 sustainment at mission systems, and higher volume on an international training program at defense systems.

backlog backlog represents the future sales we expect to recognize on firm orders received by the company and is equivalent to the company's remaining performance obligations at the end of each period. it comprises both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog. unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (idiq) contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or idiq task order is exercised or awarded. backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made.
backlog consisted of the following at december 31, 2023 and 2022:

2023 net awards totaled $44.8 billion. significant 2023 new awards include $15.5 billion for restricted programs (primarily at space systems, aeronautics systems and mission systems), $2.1 billion for f-35 programs (primarily at aeronautics systems and mission systems), $1.7 billion for e-2, $1.5 billion for triton, $1.4 billion for sda tranche 2 transport layer, and $0.8 billion for gmlrs.
subsequent event - in january 2024, the company received a termination for convenience in our restricted space business. the company expects to reduce backlog by approximately $2 billion during the first quarter of 2024 related to the termination.
liquidity and capital resources we are focused on the efficient conversion of operating income into cash to provide for the company's material cash requirements, including working capital needs, satisfaction of contractual commitments, funding of our pension and opb plans, investment in our business through capital expenditures, and shareholder return through dividend payments and share repurchases.
as of december 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion; $277 million was held outside of the u.s. by foreign subsidiaries. we expect cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities, supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities, commercial paper and/or in the capital markets through our shelf registration with the sec, if needed, to be sufficient to provide liquidity to the company in the short-term and long-term. the company has a five-year senior unsecured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion, and in april 2023, we renewed our one-year $500 million uncommitted credit facility. at december 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. in february 2023, we issued $2.0 billion of unsecured senior notes for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment, share repurchases and working capital.
the company's principal contractual commitments include purchase obligations, repayments of long-term debt and related interest, and payments under operating leases. at december 31, 2023, we had $20.7 billion of purchase obligations, approximately half of which is short-term. purchase obligations are largely comprised of open purchase order commitments to suppliers and subcontractors under u.s. government contracts. in most circumstances, our risk associated with the purchase obligations on our u.s. government contracts is limited to the termination liability provisions within those contracts. as such, we do not believe they represent a material liquidity risk to the company. at december 31, 2023, we had capital expenditure commitments of $1.4 billion, which we expect to satisfy with cash on hand. we also had provisions for uncertain tax positions of $2.0 billion, some or all of which could result in future cash payments to various taxing authorities. at this time, we are unable to estimate the timing and amount of any future cash outflows related to these uncertain tax positions.

internal revenue code (irc) section 174
beginning in 2022, the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ("tcja") eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current year and requires taxpayers to amortize them over five years pursuant to irc section 174. our 2022 cash from operations were reduced by approximately $900 million for federal estimated tax payments we made related to section 174. as we finalized our 2022 federal tax return along with our continued analysis of research and development expenditures, we reduced the previously estimated impact of section 174 on our tax liability for 2022 and 2023 to approximately $700 million and $500 million, respectively. congress is considering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to later years, possibly with retroactive effect. in the meantime, we expect to continue to make additional federal tax payments based on the current section 174 tax law. the impact of section 174 on our cash from operations depends on the amount of research and development expenditures incurred by the company and whether the irs issues guidance on the provision which differs from our current interpretation, among other things.
cash flow measures in addition to our cash position, we consider various cash flow measures in capital deployment decision-making, including cash provided by operating activities and adjusted free cash flow, a non-gaap measure described in more detail below.

2023 cash provided by operating activities increased $974 million, or 34 percent, principally due to improved trade working capital largely driven by increased billings and cash collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments.
adjusted free cash flow adjusted free cash flow, as reconciled in the table below, is a non-gaap measure defined as net cash provided by or used in operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer (not otherwise included in net cash provided by or used in operating activities) and the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions, if any. adjusted free cash flow includes proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer as such proceeds were generated in a customer sales transaction. it also includes the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions for consistency and comparability of financial performance. this measure may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. we use adjusted free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, the payment of dividends and stock repurchases. this non-gaap measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with gaap.

2023 net cash used in financing activities decreased $852 million principally due to the issuance of $2.0 billion in long-term debt, partially offset by $1.05 billion in debt repayments. cash returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends totaled $2.6 billion in each period.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. we employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. for a summary of our significant accounting policies, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition due to the long-term nature of our contracts, we generally recognize revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method, which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services.
contract sales may include estimates of variable consideration, including cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentive fees), un-priced change orders, reas and contract claims. variable consideration is included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. we estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled.
our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering, program management and financial professionals, and draws on their significant experience and judgment. we prepare eacs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract profit based on total estimated contract sales and cost. since our contracts often span a period of several years, estimation of revenue, cost, and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment. factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance, the availability, productivity and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of work to be performed, the effect of change orders, availability and cost of materials, components and subcontracts, the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations.
we also consider the impact of macroeconomic factors on our estimates, in particular on contract eacs that span several years. for example, during 2023, we included in our eacs management's best estimate of the impact inflation has had and may continue to have on our contracts. we also included our current best estimate of the impact on our eacs of disruptions we have experienced and continue to experience in the supply chain. the volatility of the recent macroeconomic environment has added complexity to our estimation process and may result in our year end 2023 contract eacs having more variability in the future than they might otherwise have had if the estimates had been prepared in a more stable macroeconomic environment.
-41-
northrop grumman corporation we generally review and reassess our sales, cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events, changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available. these assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by any number of these factors over time, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those estimates as facts and circumstances change or become known to us.
the company performs on a broad portfolio of long-term contracts, including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems, as well as advanced electronic equipment and software, that often include technology at the forefront of science. cost estimates on fixed-price development contracts and early-stage/low-rate production contracts are inherently more uncertain as to future events than on mature, full-rate production contracts. as a result, there is typically more variability in those estimates and greater financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth on fixed-price development contracts and early-stage/low-rate production contracts. changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons, including changes in contract scope, the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated, unanticipated performance and other risks affecting contract costs, performance issues with subcontractors or suppliers, changes in indirect cost allocations, such as overhead and g&a costs, and changes in estimated award and incentive fees. identified risks typically include technical, schedule and/or performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort. similarly, the changes in estimates may include changes in, or resolution of, identified opportunities for operating margin improvement.
for the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, see "segment operating results" and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
retirement benefits overview - the determination of projected benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and pension and opb expense for our retirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions. we perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries. when we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted, or as a result of plan amendments, future pension and opb expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease materially. the principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate, cash balance crediting rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, estimated fair market value of plan assets, and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and opb plans. the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions (i.e., actuarial gains or losses) are recognized immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.
discount rate - the discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and opb obligations. the discount rate is generally based on the yield of high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. at the end of each year, we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated aa or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans. taking into consideration the factors noted above, our weighted-average composite pension discount rate was 5.15 percent at december 31, 2023 and 5.54 percent at december 31, 2022.
the effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes. holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31, 2023 discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2023 pension and opb obligations, which would be reflected in the 2023 mtm expense (benefit), and 2024 expected pension and opb expense:
$ in millions        25 basis point decrease in rate                 25 basis point increase in rate
2023 pension and opb obligation and mtm expense (benefit)                      $866                                          $(827)
2024 pension and opb (benefit) expense                      (23)                22

northrop grumman corporation cash balance crediting rate - a portion of the company's pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula, where participants' hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with pay-based credits and interest. interest is credited monthly using the current 30-year treasury bond rate. the interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment returns. the cash balance crediting rate used for fas purposes tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and the related mtm expense (benefit). the minimum cash balance crediting rate allowed under the plan is 2.25 percent. the cash balance crediting rate assumption has been set to 4.02 percent for all years. holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31, 2023 cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on the 2023 pension benefit obligation, which would be reflected in the 2023 mtm expense (benefit), and 2024 expected pension expense:
$ in millions        25 basis point decrease in rate                 25 basis point increase in rate
2023 pension obligation and mtm expense (benefit)                    $(105)                                            $108
2024 pension (benefit) expense                       (9)                9
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets - the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (eroa) assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments. eroa is a long-term assumption, which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our long-term view of expected market returns and/or significant changes in our plan asset investment policy. due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption, we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including the plan's target asset allocation, historical plan asset returns and third party projection models of expected long-term returns for each of the plans' strategic asset classes. in addition to the data points themselves, we consider trends in the data points, including changes from the prior measurement date. the eroa assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for opb plans; however, we reduce the eroa for opb plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings, as certain voluntary employee beneficiary association trusts are taxable.
during 2023, the investment committee of the company's benefit plans reviewed the plans' major asset class allocations and approved an update to increase the target fixed-income asset allocation from 40% to 43%. the current asset allocation is now approximately 42% fixed-income, 27% public equities, 28% alternatives and 3% cash. at this time, the investment committee is not planning any significant changes to that mix. for further information on plan asset investments, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
while historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns, given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix, investment managers, and active asset management, we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our eroa. our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2023 was approximately 10.7 percent and our 20-year and 30-year rolling average rates of return were approximately 7.9 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively, each determined on an arithmetic basis and net of expenses. our 2023 return on plan assets, net of expenses, were approximately 11.1 percent.
consistent with our past practice, we obtained long-term capital market forecasting models from several third parties and, using our target asset allocation, developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model. we considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models, but also changes in the models year-to-year when developing our eroa.
for determining 2023 fas expense, we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.5 percent and an expected long-term rate of return on opb plan assets of 7.23 percent. for 2024 fas expense, we have assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.5 percent and 7.12 percent on opb plans. holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our december 31, 2023 eroa assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2024 expected pension and opb expense:
$ in millions                                    25 basis point decrease   25 basis point increase
2024 pension and opb expense (benefit)                     $76             $(76)
-43-
northrop grumman corporation in addition, holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in actual versus expected return on plan assets would have the following estimated effects on our 2024 mtm expense (benefit):
$ in millions                          100 basis point decrease   100 basis point increase
2024 mtm expense (benefit)                      $305              $(305)
estimated fair market value of plan assets - for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable, such as real estate, private equity, hedge funds and opportunistic investments, we develop estimates of fair value using the best information available. estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values (nav), as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals, comparable transactions, discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data.
mortality rate - mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants. in october 2014, the society of actuaries retirement plans experience committee (rpec) issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale, which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected. in october 2019, the rpec issued an updated mortality base table (the private retirement plans mortality table for 2012 (pri-2012)), which we adopted after reviewing our own historical mortality experience. in october 2021, the rpec released a new projection scale (mp-2021) that included additional underlying data for 2019, which included an increase in life expectancies relative to the prior year.
the rpec did not release a mp-2022 or mp-2023 projection scale citing complexities in incorporating the substantial number of "excess deaths" in 2020 into their existing model and uncertainties about future expectations primarily related to covid-19. as such, after considering the information released by the rpec in october 2021 as well as the company's recent mortality experience, we adopted the full mp-2021 projection scale while continuing to use the pri-2012 white collar table, supplemented with 50% of the gradual wear-off illustration as outlined in the rpec's 2022 mortality improvement update paper to reflect the future impacts of covid-19, to develop our mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and opb obligations recognized at december 31, 2023, and the amounts estimated for our 2024 pension and opb expense.
for further information regarding our pension and opb plans, see "risk factors" and notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
litigation, commitments and contingencies we are subject to a range of claims, disputes, enforcement actions, investigations, lawsuits, overhead cost claims, environmental matters, income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management. we determine whether to record a reserve and, if so, what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us. determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and, if so, of what amount, reflect management's assessment regarding what is likely to occur; they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur. the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us.
environmental matters - we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business. factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability, range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions; changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions; discovery of more or less extensive (or different) contamination than anticipated; information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination; results of efforts to involve other responsible parties; financial capabilities of other responsible parties; changes in laws and regulations, their interpretation or application; contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities; and improvements in remediation technology. as we expect to be able to recover a portion of environmental remediation liabilities through overhead charges on government contracts, such amounts are deferred in prepaid expenses and other current assets (current portion) and other non-current assets until charged to contracts. we use judgment to evaluate the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs, assessing, among other things, u.s. government regulations, our u.s. government contract mix and past practices. portions of the company's environmental liabilities we do not expect to be recoverable have been expensed. as of december 31, 2023, we expect approximately 90 percent of the company's environmental remediation costs to be recoverable; however, to the extent our judgments on the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs change or the unallowable portion of our environmental
-44-
northrop grumman corporation remediation costs otherwise increase, there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows.
income tax matters - the evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, requires the use of judgment. we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable, there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our filed tax returns or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim. the company follows a recognition and measurement approach, considering the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. we exercise judgment in determining the level of evidence necessary and appropriate to support our assessment using all available information. the technical merits of a given tax position are derived from sources of authority in the tax law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position. in measuring the tax position, the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement. when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. as of december 31, 2023, we have approximately $2.0 billion in unrecognized tax benefits. to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows.
for further information on litigation, commitments and contingencies, see "risk factors" and note 1, note 7, note 11 and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill and long-lived assets overview - we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings.
we record property, plant and equipment (pp&e) for capital assets used in operating our business. the cost of pp&e utilized in support of our government contracts is generally allowable and allocable cost in accordance with applicable far and cas requirements, which limits our risk of impairment on those assets. however, the cost of pp&e utilized in support of our commercial business, including approximately $500 million of pp&e used in our commercial space business, is not allocable to government contracts and is therefore subject to greater recoverability risk.
impairment testing - we test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units, which comprise our operating segments. the results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying value. there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.
in addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test, we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired. such indicators may include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business, significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions. during 2023, we determined there were no impairment indicators requiring us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test.
when testing goodwill for impairment, we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values. to determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows we expect the reporting units to generate in the future, consistent with our operating plans. this income valuation method requires management to project sales, operating expenses, working capital, capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi-year period, as well as to determine the weighted-average cost of capital (wacc) used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions. the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer-term contracts and barriers to market entry. the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model. we use industry multiples (including relevant control premiums) of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach.
we test for impairment of our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. our assessment is based on our projection of the undiscounted future

northrop grumman corporation operating cash flows of the related asset group. if such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount, we recognize a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.
impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. due to the many variables inherent in developing the estimates used in our impairment analyses, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of those impairment analyses.

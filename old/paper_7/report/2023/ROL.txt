the company rollins, inc. ("rollins," "we," "us," "our," or the "company"), is an international services company headquartered in atlanta, georgia that provides pest and termite control services to both residential and commercial customers through its wholly-owned subsidiaries and independent franchises in the united states, canada, australia, europe, and asia with international franchises in canada, central and south america, the caribbean, europe, the middle east, asia, africa, and australia. our pest and termite control services are performed pursuant to terms of contracts that specify the pricing arrangement with the customer. the company operates as one reportable segment and the results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer.
strategic update we are focused on continuous improvement throughout the business. during 2023, we made significant strides in all four pillars of our strategic objectives: 1) people first 2) customer loyalty 3) growth mindset and 4) operational efficiency.
people first during 2023, we focused on the safety of our people. we are continuously improving our safety culture and monitoring our measurable safety goals. for example, throughout the year we made considerable progress with respect to the implementation and adoption of our driver safety application, which monitors driver behaviors once a vehicle is in motion. our average driver safety score for drivers that we monitor showed improvement in 2023. we also executed a restructuring program during the year to modernize our workforce and enable us to make more strategic improvements in our support functions. we remain committed to developing exceptional talent and investing in our teams, including a focus on strategic hiring in both support functions, as well as the customer-facing side of our business.
customer loyalty we remain committed to providing our customers with the best customer experience. effective sales and service staffing levels helped us to capitalize on continued demand and deliver solid results for the year, with organic revenues* growing by 8.2% compared to 2022.
growth mindset
2023 marked a record year in terms of revenues, totaling $3.1 billion, an increase of 14.0% over 2022, with acquisition revenues* growing by 5.9% compared to 2022. we completed the acquisition of fox pest control ("fox"), one of the largest acquisitions in the company's history, for $339.5 million. we also completed 23 additional acquisitions in 2023, driving inorganic growth at several of our brands.
operational efficiency we saw healthy margins in 2023, with gross margin improving 70 basis points to 52.2% in 2023 compared to 51.5% in 2022. operating margin was 19.0% of revenue, an increase of 70 basis points over 2022 and adjusted operating income margin* at 19.7%, an increase of 140 basis points over the prior year.

impact of economic trends the continued disruption in economic markets due to high inflation, increases in interest rates, business interruptions due to natural disasters and changes in weather patterns, employee shortages, and supply chain issues, all pose challenges which may adversely affect our future performance. the company continues to execute various strategies previously implemented to help mitigate the impact of these economic disruptors.
however, the company cannot reasonably estimate whether these strategies will help mitigate the impact of these economic disruptors in the future.
the company's consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements. the company considered the impact of economic trends on the assumptions and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. in the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the company's financial results for the year have been made. these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature but are complicated by the continued uncertainty surrounding these macro economic trends. the severity, magnitude and duration of certain economic trends continue to be uncertain and are difficult to predict. therefore, our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to economic trends and may change materially in future periods.
the extent to which increasing interest rates, inflation and other economic trends will continue to impact the company's business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain. therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the full future impacts of these matters at this time.

revenues the following presents a summary of revenues by product and service offering and revenues by geography:
revenues for the year ended december 31, 2023 were $3.1 billion, an increase of $377.5 million, or 14.0%, from 2022 revenues of $2.7 billion. the increase in revenues was driven by demand from our customers that remained strong throughout the year across all major service offerings. comparing 2023 to 2022, organic revenue* growth was 8.2% while acquisitions drove 5.9% of total growth. looking at the service offerings, residential pest control revenue increased approximately 17%, commercial pest control revenue increased approximately 11% and termite and ancillary services grew approximately 13% including both organic and acquisition-related growth in each area. organic revenue* growth was strong across our service offerings, growing over 6% in residential, approximately 10% in commercial, and over 10% in termite and ancillary activity. the company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 7% of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.
we continue to maintain a very healthy balance sheet that positions us well to continue to invest in growth initiatives across our business as we enter 2024, from an organic perspective, we are proactively managing pricing across our portfolio. additionally, while lead generation and the overall demand environment are healthy to start the new year, we continue to navigate the negative impact of a colder january in certain parts of our business.
*amounts are non-gaap financial measures. see the schedules below for definitions and a discussion of non-gaap financial metrics, including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure.
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $1.6 billion, an increase of $216.0 million, or 15.6%, compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022. gross margin improved 70 basis points to 52.2% in 2023 compared to 51.5% in 2022. the acquisition of fox drove 20 basis points of leverage in 2023. excluding this, gross margin improved 50 basis points as pricing more than offset increases in our cost structure. looking specifically at people related costs, materials and supplies, and fleet, which comprise 87% of total cost of services, we saw an improvement of 90 basis points associated with leverage in these categories, as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures. insurance and claims experience decreased gross margins in 2023 by 10 basis points.
we expect the normal seasonality to drive lower gross profit margins in the first and fourth quarters of 2024 relative to the second and third quarters on the lower level of business activity.
sales, general and administrative for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, sales, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased $112.5 million, or 14.0%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2022. the increase is driven by people-related costs, advertising and selling expenses associated with growth initiatives. as a percentage of revenue, sg&a was consistent at 29.8% in 2023 and 2022, as we continue to manage our cost structure while investing in growth initiatives.
restructuring costs during the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, we executed a restructuring program to modernize our workforce. this effort resulted in expense of approximately $5.2 million in the year. the large majority of the costs incurred are related to severance-related costs for employees who were terminated as part of this effort. the changes were primarily across corporate-related functions and will enable us to make more strategic improvements in our support functions.
depreciation and amortization for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, depreciation and amortization increased $8.4 million, or 9.2%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2022. the increase was due to higher amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, most notably fox, offset by lower depreciation of operating equipment and internal-use software.
operating income for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, operating income increased $89.8 million or 18.2% compared to the prior year. as a percentage of revenue, operating income increased to 19.0% from 18.3% in the prior year. the improvement in operating income as a percentage of sales is primarily driven by the improvement in gross profit discussed previously.
we expect the first and fourth quarters to represent our lowest level for margins and profitability due primarily to the lower level of volume generated in those quarters due to the impact of seasonality.
interest expense, net during the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, interest expense, net increased $16.4 million compared to the prior year, due to the increase in the average debt balance associated primarily with the acquisition of fox and the share repurchase completed during 2023.
debt levels and corresponding interest expense are expected to remain elevated in the first half of 2024 due primarily to the higher level of debt associated with the acquisition of fox and the share repurchases during 2023.
other income, net during the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, other income, net increased $13.9 million primarily due to the company recognizing a $15.5 million gain on the sale of certain businesses during 2023, offset by lower gains from asset sales.
income taxes the company's effective tax rate was 25.8% in 2023 compared to 26.1% in 2022. the 2023 rate was favorably impacted by lower state income taxes and federal tax credits compared to 2022.
non-gaap financial measures reconciliation of gaap and non-gaap financial measures the company has used the non-gaap financial measures of organic revenues, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share ("eps"), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda"), ebitda margin, adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, and free cash flow in this form 10-k. organic revenue is calculated as revenue less the revenue from acquisitions completed within the prior 12 months and excluding the revenue from divested businesses. adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are calculated by adding back to the gaap measures those expenses resulting from the amortization of certain intangible assets and adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of fox pest control and restructuring costs related to restructuring and workforce reduction plans. adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are calculated by adding back to net income interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense those expenses resulting from the adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of fox pest control, restructuring costs related to restructuring and workforce reduction plans, and gains on the sale of businesses. adjusted net income and adjusted eps are calculated by adding back those acquisition-related expenses, restructuring costs, and gains on the sale of businesses to the gaap measures and by further subtracting the tax impact of those expenses and/or gains. free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash provided by operating activities. these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenues, net income, earnings per share or other performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap.
management uses adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted eps, ebitda, ebitda margin, adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, and free cash flow as measures of operating performance because this measure allows the company to compare performance consistently over various periods. management also uses organic revenues to compare revenues over various periods excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. management uses free cash flow to demonstrate the company's ability to maintain its asset base and generate future cash flows from operations. an analysis of any non-gaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap.
a non-gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either 1) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of operations, balance sheet or statement of cash flows, or 2) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented.

critical accounting estimates the company views critical accounting estimates to be those that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe our critical accounting estimates to be as follows:
accrued insurance-the company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to u.s. general liability, workers' compensation and auto liability. risks are managed through either high deductible insurance or, for clark pest control only, a non-affiliated group captive insurance member arrangement. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the group captive is subject to a third-party actuarial study retained by the captive manager, independent from the company. for the high deductible insurance program, the company contracts with an independent third-party actuary to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. management's judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce and prevent incidents and claims. initiatives that have been implemented include required pre-employment screening and ongoing motor vehicle record review for all drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post incident drug testing, driver training and post-injury nurse triage for work-related injuries. the accruals and reserves we hold are based on estimates that involve a degree of judgment and are inherently variable and could be overestimated or insufficient. if actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited.
business combinations-we account for business combinations by recognizing the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value. in valuing certain acquired assets and liabilities, fair value estimates use significant, non-observable inputs (level 3), including future expected cash flows and discount rates. goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. while we use our best estimates and assumptions to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments arising from new facts and circumstances are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. the results of operations of acquisitions are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions about intangible assets, assets and obligations assumed, contingent consideration, and other contingencies. critical inputs and assumptions in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer contracts; the acquired company's trademarks & tradenames, and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trademarks & tradenames will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio; and discount rates. these significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.

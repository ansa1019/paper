item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of the operations of msci inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries for the year ended december 31, 2023. this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the discussion summarizing the significant factors affecting the results of operations and financial condition of msci for the year ended december 31, 2022 can be found in part ii, "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022 (the "2022 annual report"), which was filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 10, 2023.
overview we are a leading provider of critical decision support tools and solutions for the global investment community. our mission-critical offerings help investors address the challenges of a transforming investment landscape and power better investment decisions. leveraging our knowledge of the global investment process and our expertise in research, data and technology, we enable our clients to understand and analyze key drivers of risk and return and confidently and efficiently build more effective portfolios. the company has five operating segments: index, analytics, esg and climate, real assets and private capital solutions (formerly burgiss), which are presented as the following four reportable segments: index, analytics, esg and climate and all other - private assets.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, we renamed the the burgiss group, llc ("burgiss") operating segment to private capital solutions. the operating segments of real assets and private capital solutions do not individually meet the segment reporting thresholds and have been combined and presented as part of the all other - private assets reportable segment.
our growth strategy includes: (a) extending leadership in research-enhanced content across asset classes, (b) leading the enablement of esg and climate investment integration, (c) enhancing distribution and content-enabling technology, (d) expanding solutions that empower client customization, (e) strengthening client relationships and growing into strategic partnerships with clients and (f) executing strategic relationships and acquisitions with complementary data, content and technology companies. for more information about our company's operations, see "item 1: business".
key financial and operating metrics and drivers in evaluating our financial performance, we focus on revenue and profit growth, including results accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap") as well as non-gaap measures, for the company as a whole and by operating segment.
we present revenues disaggregated by types and by segments, which represent our major product lines. we also review expenses by activity, which provides more transparency into how resources are being deployed. in addition, we utilize operating metrics including run rate, subscription sales and retention rate to manage and assess performance and to provide deeper insights into the recurring portion of our business.
in the discussion that follows, we provide certain variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflect the difference between the current period results as reported compared to the current period results recalculated using the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior period. while operating revenues adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations includes asset-based fees that have been adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the underlying aum, which is the primary component of asset-based fees, is not adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations. approximately three-fifths of the aum is invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, and accordingly, any such impact is excluded from the disclosed foreign currency-adjusted variances.
revenues our revenues are presented by type and by reportable segment. for each reportable segment, we present revenues disaggregated by the nature of the revenues, which are recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring revenues.
recurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts and are generally recognized ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the contract terms. the fees are recognized as we provide the product and service to the client over the license period and are generally billed in advance, prior to the license start date.
asset-based fees represent fees earned that are variable in nature, as they are primarily calculated based on the aum linked to our indexes. asset-based fees also include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to our indexes, which are based on trading volumes and fee levels.
non-recurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where we typically do not have renewal clauses within the contract. examples of such products and services include one-time license fees, certain derivative financial products, certain implementation services, historical data sets and, occasionally, fees for unlicensed usage of our content in historical periods. based on the nature of the services provided, non-recurring revenues are generally billed either in advance or after delivery and recognized point in time or over the service period.
see note 1, "introduction and basis of presentation" and note 3, "revenue recognition" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on revenue recognition.
operating expenses we group our operating expenses into the following activity categories:
•cost of revenues;
•selling and marketing;
•research and development ("r&d");
•general and administrative ("g&a");
•amortization of intangible assets; and
•depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements.
costs are assigned to these activity categories based on the nature of the expense or, when not directly attributable, an estimated allocation based on the type of effort involved. cost of revenues, selling and marketing, r&d and g&a all include both compensation as well as non-compensation related expenses.
cost of revenues cost of revenues expenses consist of costs related to the production and servicing of our products and services and primarily includes related information technology costs, including data center, cloud service, platform and infrastructure costs; costs to acquire, produce and maintain market data information; costs of research to support and maintain existing products; costs of product management teams; costs of client service and consultant teams to support customer needs; as well as other support costs directly attributable to the cost of revenues including certain human resources, finance and legal costs.
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with acquiring new clients or selling new products or product renewals to existing clients and primarily includes the costs of our sales and marketing teams, as well as costs incurred in other departments associated with acquiring new business, including product management, research, technology and sales operations.
research and development r&d expenses consist of costs to develop new or enhanced products and the costs to develop new or enhanced technologies and service platforms for the delivery of our products and services and primarily include the costs of development, research, product management, project management and the technology support directly associated with these activities.
general and administrative g&a expenses consist of costs primarily related to finance operations, human resources, office of the ceo, legal, corporate technology, corporate development, impairment charges associated with right of use assets and certain other administrative costs that are not directly attributed, but are instead allocated, to a product or service.
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets expense relates to definite-lived intangible assets arising from past acquisitions and capitalization of internally developed software projects. intangibles arising from past acquisitions consist of customer relationships, proprietary data, trademarks and trade names and technology and software. we amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. see note 1, "introduction and basis of presentation" and note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on intangible assets and amortization expense.
depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of computer and related equipment, leasehold improvements, software and furniture and fixtures over the estimated useful life of the assets.
other expense (income), net other expense (income), net consists primarily of interest we pay on our outstanding indebtedness, including losses on early extinguishment of debt, income and losses associated with our equity method investment, foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, interest we collect on cash and short-term investments, as well as other non-operating income and expense items that may arise from time to time.
non-gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda
"adjusted ebitda," a non-gaap measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as net income before (1) provision for income taxes, (2) other expense (income), net, (3) depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, (4) amortization of intangible assets and, at times, (5) certain other transactions or adjustments, including, when applicable, impairment related to sublease of leased property and certain acquisition-related integration and transaction costs.
"adjusted ebitda expenses," a non-gaap measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets and, at times, certain other transactions or adjustments, including, when applicable, impairment related to sublease of leased property and certain acquisition-related integration and transaction costs.
"adjusted ebitda margin" is defined as adjusted ebitda divided by operating revenues.
adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda expenses are believed to be meaningful measures for management to assess the operating performance of the company because they adjust for significant one-time, unusual or non-recurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of certain capital spending and acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be the company's ongoing operating performance in the period. all companies do not calculate adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda expenses in the same way. these measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on, among other things, long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. accordingly, the company's computation of the adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda expenses measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures computed by other companies.
operating metrics run rate run rate is a key operating metric and is important because an increase or decrease in our run rate ultimately impacts our future operating revenues over time. at the end of any period, we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months. we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as "run rate." see "-operating metrics-run rate" below for additional information on the calculation of this metric.
subscription sales subscription sales is a key operating metric and is important to management because new subscription sales increase our run rate and represent future operating revenues that will be recognized over time. see "-operating metrics- sales" below for additional information.
retention rate retention rate is a key operating metric and is important to management because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our future operating revenues over time. see "-operating metrics-retention rate" below for additional information on the calculation of this metric.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. significant estimates and judgments made by management include such examples as assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes. we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made. to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected.
goodwill goodwill is recorded as a result of business combinations undertaken by the company when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired. we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on july 1st and on an interim basis when certain events and circumstances exist. the test for impairment is performed at the reporting unit level. when testing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test; however, on a periodic basis, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test. when performing the quantitative test for impairment, we use the income approach to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. estimating discounted future cash flows requires significant management judgment including in estimating forecasted future cash flows and determining both discount rates and terminal growth rates. forecasted future cash flows are estimated based on a combination of historical experience and assumptions regarding the future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. discount rates are selected based on discount rates of similar public companies to the reporting unit being valued and terminal growth rates are selected based on consideration of growth rates used during the reporting unit's forecast period in combination with economic conditions. these assumptions require management's judgment and changes to these estimates or assumptions could materially affect the determination of the reporting unit's fair value. any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value. based on our qualitative assessment for 2023, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the company's reporting units is less than their respective carrying values and no impairments were recorded. see note 1, "introduction and basis of presentation" and note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on goodwill.
definite lived intangible assets definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. these events or circumstances include adverse changes in the manner in which the asset will be used, adverse changes in legal factors related to the asset or negative changes in expected financial performance of the asset, including accumulation of costs and operating losses. determining whether an event or changes in circumstances warrant an impairment review involves management judgment.
once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, determination of recoverability is determined based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. measurement of impairment for intangible assets is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is based on estimated discounted future cash flows. estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows used in the determination and calculation of impairments represent management forecasts and require significant management judgment. while management believes that its forecasts are reasonable, differences between forecasts and actual experience could materially affect the valuations. there were no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable during the years presented.
with respect to our acquisition of burgiss on october 2, 2023, the valuation of intangible assets, as part of the acquisition method of accounting, was subjective and based, in part, on inputs that were unobservable. the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the acquired intangible assets included forecasted cash flows, which were determined based on certain assumptions that included, among others, projected future revenues, and expected market royalty rates, technology obsolescence rates and discount rates. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of burgiss differently from the allocation that we have made.
we amortize our intangible assets over the estimated period of economic benefit. if the estimated period of economic benefit is changed, the prospective amortization of the intangible asset could materially change.
see note 1, "introduction and basis of presentation" and note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on intangible assets and amortization expense.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and other foreign jurisdictions. our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business. the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes.
provision for income taxes is provided for using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in our opinion, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to estimate future taxable income which requires judgment.
we must regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we file income tax returns and adjust unrecognized tax benefits when additional information is available or when an event occurs. this assessment requires significant judgment in assessment of tax laws, frequency of tax examinations, and the nature of intercompany transactions and tax positions.
see note 1, "introduction and basis of presentation" and note 12, "income taxes" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on income taxes.
factors affecting the comparability of results acquisitions of burgiss and trove on october 2, 2023, the company acquired the remaining 66.4% interest in burgiss for $696.8 million in cash. the company's existing 33.6% interest had a fair value at acquisition date of $353.2 million which resulted in a non-taxable gain of $143.0 million for the twelve months ending december 31, 2023.
prior to the acquisition, the company's ownership interest in burgiss was classified as an equity-method investment. therefore, the all other - private assets segment did not include the company's proportionate share of operating revenues and adjusted ebitda related to burgiss. the company's proportionate share of the income or loss from its equity-method investment in burgiss was reported as a component of other (expense) income, net.
following the acquisition, the consolidated results of burgiss are included in the company's private capital solutions operating segment (formerly known as burgiss), which is combined and presented as part of the all other - private assets reportable segment. see note 5, "acquisitions," and note 13, "segment information" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on the acquisition of burgiss.
on november 1, 2023 msci completed the acquisition of trove research ltd ("trove"), a carbon markets intelligence provider for approximately $37.9 million in cash. trove is a part of the esg and climate operating segment.
results of operations operating revenues our operating revenues are grouped by the following types: recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring. we also group operating revenues by major product or reportable segment as follows: index, analytics, esg and climate and all other - private assets.
the following table presents operating revenues by type for the years indicated:

total operating revenues increased 12.5% for the year ended december 31, 2023. adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, total operating revenues would have increased 11.4%.
operating revenues from recurring subscriptions increased 12.8% for the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily driven by strong growth in index products, which increased $84.9 million, or 11.6%, strong growth in esg and climate products, which increased $59.2 million, or 26.5%, growth in analytics products, which increased $36.3 million, or 6.4%, and strong growth in all other - private assets products, which increased $31.4 million, or 22.5%. adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, operating revenues from recurring subscriptions would have increased 11.4%.
operating revenues from asset-based fees increased 5.6% for the year ended december 31, 2023, mainly driven by growth in revenues from etfs linked to msci equity indexes and non-etf indexed funds linked to msci indexes, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from exchange traded futures and options contracts linked to msci indexes. operating revenues from etfs linked to msci equity indexes increased by 7.3%, primarily driven by an increase in average aum. operating revenues from non-etf indexed funds linked to msci indexes increased by 5.0%, primarily driven by an increase in average basis point fees. operating revenues from exchange traded futures and options contracts linked to msci indexes decreased by 7.5%, driven by volume decreases.
operating revenues from non-recurring revenues increased 64.3% for the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily driven by fees for unlicensed usage of our content in historical periods, as well as growth in non-recurring licensed data products.

a significant portion of the incentive compensation component of operating expenses is based on the achievement of a number of financial and operating metrics. in a scenario where operating revenue growth and profitability moderate, incentive compensation would be expected to decrease accordingly.
fixed costs constitute a significant portion of the non-compensation component of operating expenses. the discretionary non-compensation component of operating expenses could, however, be reduced in the near-term in a scenario where operating revenue growth moderates.
we had 5,794 employees as of december 31, 2023 compared to 4,759 employees as of december 31, 2022, reflecting a 21.7% growth in the number of employees. the increase is primarily driven by the burgiss and trove acquisitions. continued growth of our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefits costs. as of december 31, 2023, 66.5% of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 65.0% as of december 31, 2022.
compensation and benefits costs increased 10.8% for the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in wages and salaries and incentive compensation costs due to headcount growth, partially offset by lower severance costs and increased capitalization of expenses related to internally developed software projects adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the burgiss and trove acquisitions, compensation and benefits costs would have increased by 8.0%.
non-compensation expenses increased 5.7% for the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily driven by higher information technology, market data and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower professional fees. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the burgiss and trove acquisitions, non-compensation expenses would have increased by 2.9%.
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets expense increased 25.6% for the year ended december 31, 2023, driven by higher amortization of internal use software and additional amortization recognized on acquired intangible assets from the acquisitions of burgiss and trove.
depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements decreased 21.9% for the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily driven by lower depreciation on computers and related equipment.

the effective tax rate of 16.1% for the year ended december 31, 2023 reflects a benefit of $21.5 million from the non-taxable gain on burgiss, partially offset by the remeasurement of the deferred tax liability on the company's previous equity method investment in burgiss. in addition, the effective tax rate reflects the impact of certain favorable discrete items totaling $29.5 million, consisting of the recognition of $13.9 million of tax basis on intangible assets established under a foreign law change, $11.4 million of excess tax benefits recognized on share-based compensation vested during the period and $4.2 million related to miscellaneous prior year adjustments.
the effective tax rate of 16.6% for the year ended december 31, 2022 reflects the impact of certain favorable discrete items totaling $29.1 million, in relation to pretax income, primarily related to $28.4 million of excess tax benefits recognized on share-based compensation vested during the period.

all other - private assets operating revenues increased 23.1% for the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily driven by revenues attributable to the acquisition of burgiss as well as growth from recurring subscriptions related to index intel, climate insights, property intel and real capital analytics ("rca"), partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. adjusting for the impact of the acquisition of burgiss and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, all other - private assets operating revenues would have increased 5.7%.
all other - private assets segment adjusted ebitda expenses increased 17.5% for the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily driven by higher compensation and non-compensation expenses across the r&d, cost of revenues and selling and marketing expense activity categories, partially offset by lower compensation and non-compensation expenses in the g&a expense activity category. the increase reflects higher wages and salaries, incentive compensation and higher information technology costs, partially offset by increased capitalization of expenses related to internally developed software projects. adjusting for the impact of the acquisition of burgiss and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, all other - private assets adjusted ebitda expenses would have decreased 4.3%.
operating metrics run rate
"run rate" estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client license agreements ("client contracts") for the next 12 months, assuming all client contracts that come up for renewal, or reach the end of the committed subscription period, are renewed and assuming then-current currency exchange rates, subject to the adjustments and exclusions described below. for any client contract where fees are linked to an investment product's assets or trading volume/fees, the run rate calculation reflects, for etfs, the market value on the last trading day of the period, for futures and options, the most recent quarterly volumes and/or reported exchange fees, and for other non-etf products, the most recent client-reported assets. run rate does not include fees associated with "one-time" and other non-recurring transactions. in addition, we add to run rate the annualized fee value of recurring new sales, whether to existing or new clients, when we execute client contracts, even though the license start date, and associated revenue recognition, may not be effective until a later date. we remove from run rate the annualized fee value associated with products or services under any client contract with respect to which we have received a notice of termination, non-renewal or an indication the client does not intend to continue their subscription during the period and have determined that such notice evidences the client's final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable products or services, even though such notice is not effective until a later date.
changes in our recurring revenues typically lag changes in run rate. the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate for numerous reasons, including:
•fluctuations in revenues associated with new recurring sales;
•modifications, cancellations and non-renewals of existing client contracts, subject to specified notice requirements;
•differences between the recurring license start date and the date the client contract is executed due to, for example, contracts with onboarding periods or fee waiver periods;
•fluctuations in asset-based fees, which may result from changes in certain investment products' total expense ratios, market movements, including foreign currency exchange rates, or from investment inflows into and outflows from investment products linked to our indexes;
•fluctuations in fees based on trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to our indexes;
•fluctuations in the number of hedge funds for which we provide investment information and risk analysis to hedge fund investors;
•price changes or discounts;
•revenue recognition differences under u.s. gaap, including those related to the timing of implementation and report deliveries for certain of our products and services;
•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and
•the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.

total run rate increased 15.8% for the year ended december 31, 2023, driven by a 16.0% increase from recurring subscriptions and by a 14.9% increase from asset-based fees. adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, recurring subscriptions run rate would have increased 9.9%.
run rate from index recurring subscriptions increased 10.8% for the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily driven by market cap-weighted products, custom index products and special packages as well as factor, esg and climate products. the increase reflected growth across all regions and client segments.
run rate from index asset-based fees increased 14.9% for the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily driven by higher aum in etfs linked to msci equity indexes and non-etf indexed funds linked to msci indexes, partially offset by lower exchange traded futures and options volume.
run rate from analytics products increased 7.4% for the year ended december 31, 2023, driven by growth in both multi-asset class and equity analytics products and reflecting growth across all regions. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, analytics run rate would have increased 7.2%.
run rate from esg and climate products increased 19.6% for the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily driven by strong growth in ratings, screening and climate products. adjusting for the impact of the acquisition of trove and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, esg and climate run rate would have increased 16.1%.
run rate from all other - private assets increased 73.9% for the year ended december 31, 2023, and included $98.0 million associated with burgiss. excluding the impact of the acquisition of burgiss, the growth was primarily driven by index intel, rca and performance insights products as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. this increase reflected growth across all regions. adjusting for the impact of the acquisition of burgiss and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, all other - private assets run rate would have increased 4.9%.
sales sales represents the annualized value of products and services clients commit to purchase from msci and will result in additional operating revenues. non-recurring sales represent the actual value of the customer agreements entered into during the period and are not a component of run rate. new recurring subscription sales represent additional selling activities, such as new customer agreements, additions to existing agreements or increases in price that occurred during the period and are additions to run rate. subscription cancellations reflect client activities during the period, such as discontinuing products and services and/or reductions in price, resulting in reductions to run rate. net new recurring subscription sales represent the amount of new recurring subscription sales net of subscription cancellations during the period, which reflects the net impact to run rate during the period.
total gross sales represent the sum of new recurring subscription sales and non-recurring sales. total net sales represent the total gross sales net of the impact from subscription cancellations.

(1)includes trove's run rate commencing as of the acquisition date of november 1, 2023.
(2)includes burgiss's run rate commencing as of the acquisition date of october 2, 2023.
(3)retention rate for esg and climate excluding the impact of the acquisition of trove was 94.7% and 95.9% for the three months and year ended december 31, 2023, respectively. retention rate for all other - private assets excluding the impact of the acquisition of burgiss was 88.6% and 91.2% for the three months and year ended december 31, 2023, respectively.
retention rate is an important metric because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our future operating revenues over time. the annual retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate (subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year less actual cancels during the year) as a percentage of the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year.
the retention rate for a non-annual period is calculated by annualizing the cancellations for which we have received a notice of termination or for which we believe there is an intention not to renew or discontinue the subscription during the non-annual period, and we believe that such notice or intention evidences the client's final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable agreement, even though such notice is not effective until a later date. this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year to calculate a cancellation rate. this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100% to derive the annualized retention rate for the period.
for example, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded cancellations of $30.6 million. to derive the retention rate for the fourth quarter, we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of $30.6 million to derive $122.2 million of annualized cancellations. this $122.2 million was then divided by the $1,904.2 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year, which is adjusted to include burgiss' and trove's run rate as of the date of acquisition, to derive a cancellation rate of 6.4%. the 6.4% was then subtracted from 100.0% to derive a retention rate of 93.6% for the fourth quarter.
retention rate is computed by operating segment on a product/service-by-product/service basis. in general, if a client reduces the number of products or services to which it subscribes within a segment, or switches between products or services within a segment, we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our retention rate except in the case of a product or service switch that management considers to be a replacement product or service. in those replacement cases, only the net change to the client subscription, if a decrease, is reported as a cancellation. in the analytics and the esg and climate operating segments, substantially all product or service switches are treated as replacement products or services and netted in this manner, while in our index and real assets operating segments, product or service switches that are treated as replacement products or services and receive netting treatment occur only in certain limited instances. in addition, we treat any reduction in fees resulting from a down-sell of the same product or service as a cancellation to the extent of the reduction. we do not calculate retention rate for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in index-linked investment products or futures and options contracts, in each case, linked to our indexes.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, 32.8% of our cancellations occurred in the fourth quarter. in our product lines, retention rate is generally higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter, as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year.
liquidity and capital resources we require capital to fund ongoing operations, internal growth initiatives and acquisitions. our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our existing credit facility. in addition, we believe we have access to additional funding in the public and private markets. we intend to use these sources of liquidity to, among other things, service our existing and future debt obligations, fund our working capital requirements for capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and dividend payments, and make repurchases of our common stock. in connection with our business strategy, we regularly evaluate acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities. the company used available cash to fund the acquisition of the remaining interest in burgiss on october 2, 2023. we believe our liquidity, along with other financing alternatives, will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth.
senior notes and credit agreement as of december 31, 2023, we had an aggregate of $4,200.0 million in senior notes outstanding. in addition, under the prior credit agreement, we had as of december 31, 2023: (i) an aggregate of $339.1 million in tranche a term loans outstanding under the tla facility and (ii) $500 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. see note 6, "debt," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our outstanding indebtedness and revolving credit facility.
on january 26, 2024, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (the "credit agreement") amending and restating in its entirety the prior credit agreement. the credit agreement makes available an aggregate of $1,250.0 million of revolving loan commitments under the revolving credit facility, which may be drawn until january 26, 2029. the revolving credit facility under the credit agreement was drawn at closing in an amount sufficient to prepay all term loans outstanding under the tla facility under the prior credit agreement. the obligations under the credit agreement are general unsecured obligations of the company.
as of december 31, 2023, the senior notes and the prior credit agreement were fully and unconditionally, and jointly and severally, guaranteed by our direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that account for more than 5% of our and our subsidiaries' consolidated assets, other than certain excluded subsidiaries (the "subsidiary guarantors"). upon the closing of the credit agreement on january 26, 2024, the subsidiary guarantors' were released from their guarantees under the prior credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes (the "indentures").
the indentures among us and computershare, national association, as trustee and successor to wells fargo bank, national association, contain covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, and that limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness.
the credit agreement also contains covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, and that limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness.
the credit agreement and the indentures also contain customary events of default, including those relating to non-payment, breach of representations, warranties or covenants, cross-default and cross-acceleration, and bankruptcy and insolvency events, and, in the case of the credit agreement, invalidity or impairment of loan documentation, change of control and customary erisa defaults in addition to the foregoing. none of the restrictions detailed above are expected to impact our ability to effectively operate the business.
the credit agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve financial and operating results sufficient to maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis through the termination of the credit agreement: (1) the maximum consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis not to exceed 4.25:1.00 (or 4.50:1.00 for four fiscal quarters following a material acquisition) and (2) the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis of at least 4.00:1.00. as of december 31, 2023, our consolidated leverage ratio was 2.64:1.00 and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 8.92:1.00.
as of december 31, 2023, the non-guarantor subsidiaries under the senior notes and the prior credit agreement consisted of: (i) domestic subsidiaries of the company that accounted for 5% or less of consolidated assets of the company and its subsidiaries and (ii) any foreign or domestic subsidiary of the company that was deemed to be a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. the non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $1,544.8 million, or 61.1%, of our total revenue for the trailing 12 months ended december 31, 2023, approximately $745.3 million, or 53.8%, of our consolidated operating income for the trailing 12 months ended december 31, 2023, and approximately $1,149.8 million, or 20.8%, of our consolidated total assets (excluding intercompany assets) and $1,055.2 million, or 16.9%, of our consolidated total liabilities, in each case as of december 31, 2023. upon the closing of the credit agreement on january 26, 2024, the subsidiary guarantors were released from their guarantees under the prior credit agreement and indentures.
share repurchases in 2022, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for the purchase of shares of the company's common stock in the open market. see note 11, "shareholders' equity (deficit)," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase program.
as of trade date february 8, 2024, a total of $845.7 million of authorization remained available under the share repurchase program. this authorization may be modified, suspended or terminated by the board of directors at any time without prior notice.
cash dividends on september 17, 2014, our board of directors approved a plan to initiate a regular quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders. on october 30, 2014, we began paying regular quarterly cash dividends and have paid such dividends each quarter thereafter.
on january 29, 2024, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.60 per share for the three months ending march 31, 2024. this reflects an increase of 15.9% over the quarterly cash dividend declared for the three months ended december 31, 2023. the first quarter 2024 dividend is payable on february 29, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of trading on february 16, 2024.

cash and cash equivalents we typically seek to maintain minimum cash balances globally of approximately $225.0 million to $275.0 million for general operating purposes. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, $285.2 million and $344.5 million, respectively, of the cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. repatriation of some foreign cash may be subject to certain withholding taxes in local jurisdictions and other distribution restrictions. we believe the global cash and cash equivalent balances that are maintained will be available to meet our global needs whether for general corporate purposes or other needs, including acquisitions or expansion of our products.
cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. the year-over-year change was primarily driven by higher cash collections from customers, partially offset by higher income tax payments and cash expenses, mainly reflecting higher cash compensation.
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation and benefits costs, income taxes, interest expense, information technology costs, professional fees, market data costs and office rent. historically, the payment of cash for compensation and benefits is at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year.
cash flows from investing activities the year-over-year change was primarily driven by the acquisitions of burgiss and trove.
cash flows from financing activities the year-over-year change was primarily driven by the impact of lower share repurchases, partially offset by lower proceeds from borrowings.
we believe that global cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under our existing revolving credit facility and our ability to access bank debt, private debt and the capital markets for additional funds, will continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as material capital expenditures and share repurchases, for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10-k and for the foreseeable future thereafter. in addition, we expect that foreign cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10-k and for the foreseeable future thereafter.
contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist primarily of our debt obligations arising from the issuance of the senior notes, tranche a term loans, leases for office space, leases for equipment and other operating leases and obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts. the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of december 31, 2023:

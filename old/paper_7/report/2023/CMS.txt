item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is a combined report of cms energy and consumers.
executive overview cms energy is an energy company operating primarily in michigan. it is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including consumers, an electric and gas utility, and northstar clean energy, primarily a domestic independent power producer and marketer. consumers' electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, and consumers' gas utility operations include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas. consumers' customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. northstar clean energy, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged in domestic independent power production, including the development and operation of renewable generation, and the marketing of independent power production.
cms energy and consumers manage their businesses by the nature of services each provides. cms energy operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and northstar clean energy, its non‐utility operations and investments. consumers operates principally in two business table of contents segments: electric utility and gas utility. cms energy's and consumers' businesses are affected primarily by:
•regulation and regulatory matters
•state and federal legislation
•economic conditions
•weather
•energy commodity prices
•interest rates
•their securities' credit ratings the triple bottom line cms energy's and consumers' purpose is to achieve world class performance while delivering hometown service. in support of this purpose, cms energy and consumers employ the "ce way," a lean operating model designed to improve safety, quality, cost, delivery, and employee morale.
cms energy and consumers measure their progress toward the purpose by considering their impact on the "triple bottom line" of people, planet, and profit, which is underpinned by performance; this consideration takes into account not only the economic value that cms energy and consumers create for customers and investors, but also their responsibility to social and environmental goals. the triple bottom line balances the interests of employees, customers, suppliers, regulators, creditors, michigan's residents, the investment community, and other stakeholders, and it reflects the broader societal impacts of cms energy's and consumers' activities.
cms energy's sustainability report, which is available to the public, describes cms energy's and consumers' progress toward world class performance measured in the areas of people, planet, and profit.
people: the people element of the triple bottom line represents cms energy's and consumers' commitment to their employees, their customers, the residents of local communities in which they do business, and other stakeholders.
the safety of employees, customers, and the general public is a priority of cms energy and consumers. accordingly, cms energy and consumers have worked to integrate a set of safety principles into their business operations and culture. these principles include complying with applicable safety, health, and security regulations and implementing programs and processes aimed at continually improving safety and security conditions. over the last ten years, consumers' osha recordable incident rate has decreased by 20 percent.
table of contents cms energy and consumers also place a high priority on customer value and on providing a hometown customer experience. consumers' customer-driven investment program is aimed at improving safety and increasing electric and gas reliability.
in september 2023, consumers filed its reliability roadmap, an update to its previous electric distribution infrastructure investment plan filed in 2021, with the mpsc. the reliability roadmap outlines a five-year strategy to improve consumers' electric distribution system and the reliability of the grid. the plan proposes the following spending for projects designed to reduce the number and duration of power outages to customers through investment in infrastructure upgrades, forestry management, and grid modernization:
•capital expenditures of $7 billion over the next five years; this amount is $3 billion higher than proposed in the previous plan
•maintenance and operating spending of $1.7 billion over the next five years, reflecting an increase of $300 million over the previous plan consumers will request rate recovery of these proposed expenditures in future electric rate cases.
central to consumers' commitment to its customers are the initiatives it has undertaken to keep electricity and natural gas affordable, including:
•replacement of coal-fueled generation and ppas with a cost-efficient mix of renewable energy, less-costly dispatchable generation sources, and energy waste reduction and demand response programs
•targeted infrastructure investment to reduce maintenance costs and improve reliability and safety
•supply chain optimization
•economic development to increase sales and reduce overall rates
•information and control system efficiencies
•employee and retiree health care cost sharing
•tax planning
•cost-effective financing
•workforce productivity enhancements while cms energy and consumers have experienced some supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, they have taken steps to mitigate the impact on their ability to provide safe and reliable service to customers.
planet: the planet element of the triple bottom line represents cms energy's and consumers' commitment to protect the environment. this commitment extends beyond compliance with various state and federal environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. management considers climate change and other environmental risks in strategy development, business planning, and enterprise risk management processes.
cms energy and consumers continue to focus on opportunities to protect the environment and reduce their carbon footprint from owned generation. cms energy, including consumers, has decreased its combined percentage of electric supply (self-generated and purchased) from coal by 25 percentage points since 2015. additionally, as a result of actions already taken through 2023, initial measurement data indicates consumers has:
•reduced carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 40 percent since 2005
•reduced methane emissions by more than 25 percent since 2012
•reduced the volume of water used to generate electricity by more than 50 percent since 2012

•reduced landfill waste disposal by more than 1.8 million tons since 1992
•enhanced, restored, or protected more than 8,800 acres of land since 2017
since 2005, consumers has reduced its sulfur dioxide and particulate matter emissions by more than 95 percent and its nox emissions by nearly 88 percent. consumers began tracking mercury emissions in 2007; since that time, it has reduced such emissions by nearly 93 percent.
presented in the following illustration are consumers' reductions in these emissions:
in november 2023, michigan enacted the 2023 energy law, which among other things:
•raises the renewable energy standard from the present 15-percent requirement to 50 percent by 2030 and 60 percent by 2035; renewable energy generated anywhere within miso may be applied to meeting this standard, with certain limitations
•sets a clean energy standard of 80 percent by 2035 and 100 percent by 2040; low- or zero-carbon emitting resources, such as nuclear generation and natural gas generation coupled with carbon capture, are considered clean energy sources under this standard
•enhances existing incentives for energy efficiency programs and returns earned on competitively bid ppas
•expands the statutory cap on distributed generation resources to ten percent consumers is required to file updates to its amended renewable energy plan before or in 2025 and its clean energy plan before or in 2027. together, these updated plans will outline a path to meeting the requirements of the 2023 energy law by focusing on increasing the generation of renewable energy, deploying energy storage, helping customers use less energy, and offering demand response programs to reduce demand during critical peak times.
table of contents consumers' clean energy plan details its strategy to meet customers' long-term energy needs and was most recently revised and approved by the mpsc in june 2022 under michigan's integrated resource planning process. the clean energy plan outlines consumers' long-term strategy for delivering clean, reliable, resilient, and affordable energy to its customers, including plans to:
•end the use of coal-fueled generation in 2025, 15 years sooner than initially planned
•purchase the covert generating station, a natural gas-fueled generating facility with 1,200 mw of nameplate capacity, allowing consumers to continue to provide controllable sources of electricity to customers; this purchase was completed in may 2023
•solicit up to 700 mw of capacity through ppas from sources able to deliver to michigan's lower peninsula beginning in 2025
•expand its investment in renewable energy, adding nearly 8,000 mw of solar generation by 2040
under the clean energy plan, consumers earns a return equal to its pre-tax weighted-average cost of capital on permanent capital structure on payments made under new competitively bid ppas with non‐affiliated entities approved by the mpsc.
the clean energy plan will allow consumers to exceed its breakthrough goal of at least 50‐percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction by 2030.
table of contents presented in the following illustration is consumers' 2021 capacity portfolio and its future capacity portfolio under its clean energy plan. this illustration includes the effects of purchased capacity and customer programs and uses the nameplate capacity for all energy sources:
1    does not include recs.
2    includes energy waste reduction, demand response, and conservation voltage reduction programs.
3    these amounts and fuel sources will vary and are dependent on a one‐time competitive solicitation to acquire up to 700 mw of capacity through ppas from sources able to deliver to michigan's lower peninsula beginning in 2025.
in addition to consumers' plan to eliminate its use of coal-fueled generation in 2025, cms energy and consumers have set the net‐zero emissions goals discussed below.
net-zero methane emissions from natural gas delivery system by 2030: under its methane reduction plan, consumers plans to reduce methane emissions from its system by about 80 percent, from 2012 baseline levels, by accelerating the replacement of aging pipe, rehabilitating or retiring outdated infrastructure, and adopting new technologies and practices. the remaining emissions will likely be offset by purchasing and/or producing renewable natural gas. to date, consumers has reduced methane emissions by more than 25 percent.
net-zero carbon emissions from electric business by 2040: this goal includes not only emissions from owned generation, but also emissions from the generation of power purchased through long-term ppas and from the miso energy market. consumers expects to meet 90 percent of its customers' needs with clean energy sources by 2040 through execution of its clean energy plan. new technologies and carbon offset measures including, but not limited to, carbon sequestration, methane emission capture, forest preservation, and reforestation may be used to close the gap to achieving net-zero carbon emissions.
table of contents net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target for the entire business by 2050: this goal incorporates greenhouse gas emissions from consumers' natural gas delivery system, including suppliers and customers, and has an interim goal of reducing customer emissions by 20 percent by 2030. consumers expects to meet this goal through carbon offset measures, renewable natural gas, energy efficiency and demand response programs, and the adoption of cost-effective emerging technologies once proven and commercially available.
additionally, to advance its environmental stewardship in michigan and to minimize the impact of future regulations, consumers set the following targets in 2022:
•to enhance, restore, or protect 6,500 acres of land by 2026; through 2023, consumers enhanced, restored, or protected more than 2,700 acres of land
•to reduce water usage by 1.5 billion gallons by 2026; through 2023, consumers reduced water usage by more than 1.4 billion gallons
•to increase the rate of waste diverted from landfills (through waste reduction, recycling, and reuse) to 90 percent through 2023 from a baseline of 88 percent in 2021; during 2023, consumers' rate of waste diverted from landfills was 91 percent cms energy and consumers are monitoring numerous legislative, policy, and regulatory initiatives, including those to regulate and report greenhouse gases, and related litigation. while cms energy and consumers cannot predict the outcome of these matters, which could affect them materially, they intend to continue to move forward with their clean and lean strategy.
profit: the profit element of the triple bottom line represents cms energy's and consumers' commitment to meeting their financial objectives and providing economic development opportunities and benefits in the communities in which they do business. cms energy's and consumers' financial strength allows them to maintain solid investment-grade credit ratings and thereby reduce funding costs for the benefit of customers and investors, to attract and retain talent, and to reinvest in the communities they serve.
in 2023, cms energy's net income available to common stockholders was $877 million, and diluted eps were $3.01. this compares with net income available to common stockholders of $827 million and diluted eps of $2.85 in 2022. in 2023, gas and electric rate increases, operational cost performance, and gains on the extinguishment of debt were offset partially by lower gas and electric sales due primarily to unfavorable weather, higher service restoration costs attributable to storms, and higher interest charges. a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting cms energy's and consumers' performance can be found in the results of operations section that follows this executive overview.
over the next five years, consumers expects weather-normalized electric and gas deliveries to remain relatively stable compared to 2023. this outlook reflects the effects of energy waste reduction programs offset by modest growth in electric and gas demand.
table of contents performance: impacting the triple bottom line cms energy and consumers remain committed to achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service and positively impacting the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit. during 2023, cms energy met all requirements for inclusion in the msci esg leaders indexes; these indexes are designed to represent the performance of companies that have high environmental, social, and governance ratings relative to their sector peers. additionally, consumers:
•was selected to receive a $100 million grant from the u.s. department of energy to fund investments in its electric distribution system, improving the reliability of michigan's electric grid
•participated in the state's economic development efforts that have resulted in commitments by large third-party manufacturers to construct facilities for electric vehicle batteries and battery components in michigan
•announced plans for an 85-mw solar array to be constructed at the former d.e. karn coal-generating facilities, which were retired earlier in 2023
•grew its voluntary large customer renewable energy program to approximately 365 mw
•opened a state-of-the-art natural gas training facility in flint, michigan that will facilitate employee training that is critical to keeping workers, customers, and the public safe
•announced plans to install more than 120 automatic transfer reclosers to improve electric reliability and help prevent power outages
•completed the first phase of its mid-michigan pipeline project, part of consumers' commitment to providing safe, reliable, and affordable natural gas to michigan homes and businesses
•announced new efforts to install electric vehicle chargers at apartment buildings, condominiums, and overnight community locations across the state of michigan
•was one of 15 recipients of the u.s. department of defense's 2023 secretary of defense employer support freedom award, an honor to employers for support of national guard and reserve employees cms energy and consumers will continue to utilize the ce way to enable them to achieve world class performance and positively impact the triple bottom line. consumers' investment plan and the regulatory environment in which it operates also drive its ability to impact the triple bottom line.
investment plan: over the next five years, consumers expects to make significant expenditures on infrastructure upgrades, replacements, and clean generation. while it has a large number of potential investment opportunities that would add customer value, consumers has prioritized its spending based on the criteria of enhancing public safety, increasing reliability, maintaining affordability for its customers, and advancing its environmental stewardship. consumers' investment program, which is subject to approval through general rate case proceedings, is expected to result in annual rate-base growth of more than seven percent. this rate-base growth, together with cost-control measures, should allow consumers to maintain affordable customer prices.
table of contents presented in the following illustration are consumers' planned capital expenditures through 2028 of $17.0 billion:
of this amount, consumers plans to spend $13.6 billion over the next five years primarily to maintain and upgrade its electric distribution systems and gas infrastructure in order to enhance safety and reliability, improve customer satisfaction, reduce energy waste on those systems, and facilitate its clean energy transformation. electric distribution and other projects comprise $7.3 billion primarily to strengthen circuits and substations, replace poles, and interconnect clean energy resources. the gas infrastructure projects comprise $6.3 billion to sustain deliverability, enhance pipeline integrity and safety, and reduce methane emissions. consumers also expects to spend $3.4 billion on clean generation, which includes investments in wind, solar, and hydroelectric generation resources.
regulation: regulatory matters are a key aspect of consumers' business, particularly rate cases and regulatory proceedings before the mpsc, which permit recovery of new investments while helping to ensure that customer rates are fair and affordable. important regulatory events and developments not already discussed are summarized below.
2023 gas rate case: in december 2023, consumers filed an application with the mpsc seeking an annual rate increase of $136 million based on a 10.25‐percent authorized return on equity for the projected 12‐month period ending september 30, 2025. the filing requests authority to recover new infrastructure investment and related costs that are expected to allow consumers to continue to provide safe, reliable, affordable, and increasingly cleaner natural gas service.
2022 gas rate case: in august 2023, the mpsc approved a settlement agreement authorizing an annual rate increase of $95 million, based on a 9.9‐percent authorized return on equity, effective october 1, 2023. the mpsc also authorized the use of a cost deferral mechanism that will allow consumers to defer for future recovery or refund pension and opeb expense above or below the amounts used to set existing rates.

2023 electric rate case: in may 2023, consumers filed an application with the mpsc seeking a rate increase of $216 million, made up of two components. first, consumers requested a $207 million annual rate increase, based on an authorized return on equity of 10.25 percent for the projected 12‐month period ending february 28, 2025. the filing requested authority to recover costs related to new infrastructure investment primarily in distribution system reliability and cleaner energy resources. second, consumers requested approval of a surcharge for the recovery of $9 million of distribution investments made in 2022 that exceeded the rates authorized in accordance with the december 2021 electric rate order. in september 2023, consumers revised its requested increase to $169 million.
2022 electric rate case: in january 2023, the mpsc approved a settlement agreement authorizing an annual rate increase of $155 million, based on a 9.9‐percent authorized return on equity. the mpsc also approved a surcharge for the recovery of $6 million of depreciation, property tax, and interest expense related to distribution investments made in 2021 that exceeded what was authorized in rates in accordance with the december 2020 electric rate order. the new rates became effective january 20, 2023.
looking forward cms energy and consumers will continue to consider the impact on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit in their daily operations as well as in their long-term strategic decisions. consumers will continue to seek fair and timely regulatory treatment that will support its customer-driven investment plan, while pursuing cost-control measures that will allow it to maintain sustainable customer base rates. the ce way is an important means of realizing cms energy's and consumers' purpose of achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service.

capital resources and liquidity cms energy and consumers expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund their present and future commitments. cms energy uses dividends and tax-sharing payments from its subsidiaries and external financing and capital transactions to invest in its utility and non‐utility businesses, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund its other obligations. the ability of cms energy's subsidiaries, including consumers, to pay dividends to cms energy depends upon each subsidiary's revenues, earnings, cash needs, and other factors. in addition, consumers' ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain terms included in its articles of incorporation and potentially by ferc requirements and provisions under the federal power act and the natural gas act. for additional details on consumers' dividend restrictions, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 4, financings and capitalization-dividend restrictions. during the year ended december 31, 2023, consumers paid $695 million in dividends on its common stock to cms energy.
table of contents consumers uses cash flows generated from operations and external financing transactions, as well as stockholder contributions from cms energy, to fund capital expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund its other obligations. consumers also uses these sources of funding to contribute to its employee benefit plans.
financing and capital resources: cms energy and consumers rely on the capital markets to fund their robust capital plan. barring any sustained market dislocations or disruptions, cms energy and consumers expect to continue to have ready access to the financial and capital markets and will continue to explore possibilities to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise with respect to future funding needs. if access to these markets were to diminish or otherwise become restricted, cms energy and consumers would implement contingency plans to address debt maturities, which could include reduced capital spending.
in january 2024, consumers issued $600 million of first mortgage bonds that mature in may 2029 and bear interest at a rate of 4.600 percent. the proceeds of the bonds will be used for general corporate purposes.
also in january 2024, cms energy retired $250 million of its senior notes bearing an interest rate of 3.875 percent and an original maturity date of march 2024.
in 2023, cms energy entered into an equity offering program under which it may sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $1 billion in privately negotiated transactions, in "at the market" offerings, or through forward sales transactions. there have been no sales of securities under this program.
cms energy entered into forward sales transactions, under its previous equity offering program, that it may either settle physically by issuing shares of its common stock at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreement or settle net by delivering or receiving cash or shares. cms energy may settle the contracts at any time through their maturity dates, and presently intends to physically settle the contracts by delivering shares of its common stock. as of december 31, 2023, these contracts had an aggregate sales price of $265 million, maturing through december 2024. in january 2024, cms energy settled the remaining forward sale contracts issued under its previous equity offering program. for more information on these forward sale contracts, see notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 4, financings and capitalization.
at december 31, 2023, cms energy had $526 million of its revolving credit facility available and consumers had $1.3 billion available under its revolving credit facilities. cms energy and consumers use these credit facilities for general working capital purposes and to issue letters of credit. an additional source of liquidity is consumers' commercial paper program, which allows consumers to issue, in one or more placements, up to $500 million in aggregate principal amount of commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 365 days at market interest rates. these issuances are supported by consumers' revolving credit facilities. while the amount of outstanding commercial paper does not reduce the available capacity of the revolving credit facilities, consumers does not intend to issue commercial paper in an amount exceeding the available capacity of the facilities. at december 31, 2023, there were $93 million commercial paper notes outstanding under this program. for additional details on cms energy's and consumers' secured revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, see notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 4, financings and capitalization.
table of contents certain of cms energy's and consumers' credit agreements contain covenants that require cms energy and consumers to maintain certain financial ratios, as defined therein. at december 31, 2023, no default had occurred with respect to any financial covenants contained in cms energy's and consumers' credit agreements. cms energy and consumers were each in compliance with these covenants as of december 31, 2023, as presented in the following table:
limit                            actual cms energy, parent only debt to capital               &lt; 0.70 to 1.0            0.58 to 1.0

material cash requirements: based on the present investment plan, during 2024, cms energy, including consumers, projects capital expenditures of $3.5 billion and consumers projects capital expenditures of $3.3 billion. cms energy's 2024 contractual commitments comprise $2.4 billion of purchase obligations and $1.7 billion of principal and interest payments on long-term debt. consumers' 2024 contractual commitments comprise $2.3 billion of purchase obligations and $1.2 billion of principal and interest payments on long-term debt.
components of cms energy's and consumers' cash management plan include controlling operating expenses and capital expenditures and evaluating market conditions for financing and refinancing opportunities. cms energy's and consumers' present level of cash and expected cash flows from operating activities, together with access to sources of liquidity, are anticipated to be sufficient to fund contractual obligations and other material cash requirements for 2024 and beyond.
capital expenditures: over the next five years, cms energy and consumers expect to make substantial capital investments. the companies may revise their forecast of capital expenditures periodically due to a number of factors, including environmental regulations, mpsc approval or disapproval, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and the ability to access capital. presented in the following table are cms energy's and consumers' estimated capital expenditures, including lease commitments, for 2024 through 2028:

consumers electric utility outlook and uncertainties clean energy plan: consumers' clean energy plan details its strategy to meet customers' long-term energy needs and provides the foundation for its goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from its electric business by 2040. under this net-zero goal, consumers plans to eliminate the impact of carbon table of contents emissions created by the electricity it generates or purchases for customers. additionally, through its clean energy plan, consumers continues to make progress on expanding its customer programs, namely its demand response, energy efficiency, and conservation voltage reduction programs, as well as increasing its renewable energy generation.
the clean energy plan was most recently revised and approved by the mpsc in june 2022. under this plan, consumers will eliminate the use of coal-fueled generation in 2025 and expects to meet 90 percent of its customers' needs with clean energy sources by 2040. specifically, the clean energy plan provides for:
•the retirement of the d.e. karn coal-fueled generating units, totaling 515 mw of nameplate capacity; these units closed in june 2023
•the retirement of the j.h. campbell coal-fueled generating units, totaling 1,407 mw of nameplate capacity, in 2025
•the retirement of the d.e. karn oil and gas-fueled generating units, totaling 1,219 mw of nameplate capacity, in 2031
the mpsc authorized consumers to issue securitization bonds to finance the recovery of and return on the d.e. karn coal-fueled generating units; consumers issued these bonds in december 2023. additionally, the mpsc has authorized regulatory asset treatment for consumers to recover the remaining book value of the j.h. campbell coal-fueled generating units, as well as a 9.0‐percent return on equity, commencing in 2025.
under the clean energy plan, consumers:
•purchased the covert generating station, a natural gas-fueled generating facility with 1,200 mw of nameplate capacity in van buren county, michigan in may 2023
•conducted a one‐time competitive solicitation for up to 700 mw of capacity through ppas from sources able to deliver to michigan's lower peninsula beginning in 2025 (including up to 500 mw from dispatchable sources)
these actions are expected to help consumers continue to provide controllable sources of electricity to customers while expanding its investment in renewable energy. the clean energy plan forecasts renewable energy capacity levels of 30 percent in 2025, 43 percent in 2030, and 61 percent in 2040, including the addition of nearly 8,000 mw of solar generation. additionally, consumers plans to deploy battery storage beginning in 2024, with 75 mw of energy storage expected by 2027 and an additional 475 mw by 2040. the 2023 energy law, enacted in november 2023, set more ambitious standards for renewable energy and energy storage. under michigan's integrated resource planning process, consumers is required to file proposed updates to its clean energy plan before or in 2027 to meet these accelerated timelines.
under its clean energy plan, consumers bids new capacity competitively and expects to own and operate approximately 50 percent of new capacity, with the remainder being built and owned by third parties. additionally, consumers earns a return equal to its pre-tax weighted-average cost of capital on permanent capital structure on payments made under new competitively bid ppas with non‐affiliated entities approved by the mpsc.
table of contents as a result of requests for proposals, consumers has entered into ppas to purchase renewable capacity, energy, and recs from solar generating facilities and build transfer agreements to purchase solar generating facilities. presented in the following illustration is the aggregate renewable capacity that consumers expects to add to its portfolio as a result of these agreements:
additionally, as a result of its one-time solicitation, consumers entered into a 20-year ppa under which it will purchase 100 mw of capacity, energy and recs from a battery storage facility to be constructed in branch county, michigan. the facility is expected to be operational in 2025. consumers continues to evaluate the acquisition of additional capacity from intermittent resources and dispatchable, non‐intermittent clean capacity resources (including battery storage resources). any contracts entered into as a result of the one-time solicitation are subject to mpsc approval.
renewable energy plan: the 2023 energy law raises the renewable energy standard from the present 15-percent requirement to 50 percent by 2030 and 60 percent by 2035. consumers is required to submit recs, which represent proof that the associated electricity was generated from a renewable energy resource, in an amount equal to at least the required percentage of consumers' electric sales volume each year. under its renewable energy plan, consumers has met and expects to continue to meet its renewable energy requirement each year with a combination of newly generated recs and previously generated recs carried over from prior years.
the mpsc has approved the acquisition of up to 525 mw of new wind generation projects and authorized consumers to earn a 10.7‐percent return on equity on any projects approved by the mpsc under consumers' amended renewable energy plan. specifically, the mpsc has approved the following:
•purchase and construction of a 150‐mw wind generation project in gratiot county, michigan; the project became operational and consumers took full ownership in 2020
•purchase of a 166‐mw wind generation project in hillsdale, michigan; the project became operational and consumers took full ownership in 2021

•purchase of a 201-mw wind generation project in gratiot county, michigan; the project became operational and consumers took full ownership of the project in december 2023
the mpsc also approved the execution of a 20-year ppa under which consumers will purchase 100 mw of renewable capacity, energy, and recs from a 149‐mw solar generating facility to be constructed in calhoun county, michigan; the facility is targeted to be operational in 2024.
voluntary large customer renewable energy program: consumers provides service under a program that provides large full-service electric customers with the opportunity to advance the development of renewable energy beyond the present 15-percent requirement. in september 2023, consumers filed an application to amend its renewable energy plan. among other things, consumers requested that the mpsc remove the 1,000-mw limit on new wind and solar generation, which will allow consumers to meet growing customer demand for the program. consumers competitively solicits for additional renewable energy assets based on customer applications and will construct the assets based on customer subscriptions to the program.
as part of this program, a 2022 request for proposals resulted in the execution of a build transfer agreement for a 309‐mw solar generating facility to be constructed in calhoun county, michigan; the facility is targeted to be operational in 2025. the build transfer agreement was approved by the mpsc in september 2023. additionally, the request for proposals resulted in the selection of a solar generation project that consumers will develop and construct at its d.e. karn generating site, with a capacity of up to 85 mw. the facility is expected to be operational in 2026.
electric customer deliveries and revenue: consumers' electric customer deliveries are seasonal and largely dependent on michigan's economy. the consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment. in addition, consumers' electric rates, which follow a seasonal rate design, are higher in the summer months than in the remaining months of the year. each year in june, electric residential customers transition to a summer peak time-of-use rate that allows them to take advantage of lower-cost energy during off-peak times during the summer months. thus, customers can reduce their electric bills by shifting their consumption from on‐peak to off‐peak times.
over the next five years, consumers expects weather-normalized electric deliveries to remain relatively stable compared to 2023. this outlook reflects the effects of energy waste reduction programs offset by modest growth in electric demand. actual delivery levels will depend on:
•energy conservation measures and results of energy waste reduction programs
•weather fluctuations
•michigan's economic conditions, including utilization, expansion, or contraction of manufacturing facilities, population trends, electric vehicle adoption, and housing activity electric roa: michigan law allows electric customers in consumers' service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten percent of consumers' sales, with certain exceptions. at december 31, 2023, electric deliveries under the roa program were at the ten‐percent limit. fewer than 300 of consumers' electric customers purchased electric generation service under the roa program.
in 2016, michigan law established a path to ensure that forward capacity is secured for all electric customers in michigan, including customers served by alternative electric suppliers under roa. the law also authorized the mpsc to ensure that alternative electric suppliers have procured enough capacity to cover their anticipated capacity requirements for the four‐year forward period. in 2017, the mpsc issued an order establishing a state reliability mechanism for consumers. under this mechanism, if an alternative table of contents electric supplier does not demonstrate that it has procured its capacity requirements for the four‐year forward period, its customers will pay a set charge to the utility for capacity that is not provided by the alternative electric supplier.
during 2017, the mpsc issued orders finding that it has statutory authority to determine and implement a local clearing requirement, which requires all electric suppliers to demonstrate that a portion of the capacity used to serve customers is located in the miso footprint in michigan's lower peninsula. in 2020, the michigan supreme court affirmed the mpsc's statutory authority to implement a local clearing requirement on individual electric providers.
in 2020, abate and another intervenor filed a complaint against the mpsc in the u.s. district court for the eastern district of michigan challenging the constitutionality of a local clearing requirement. the complaint requests the federal court to issue a permanent injunction prohibiting the mpsc from implementing a local clearing requirement on individual electric providers. in february 2023, the u.s. district court for the eastern district of michigan dismissed the complaint. in march 2023, abate and the other intervenor filed a claim of appeal of the eastern district court's decision with the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit. oral arguments occurred in december 2023.
electric rate matters: rate matters are critical to consumers' electric utility business. for additional details on rate matters, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 2, regulatory matters and note 3, contingencies and commitments.
mpsc distribution system audit: in october 2022, the mpsc ordered the state's two largest electric utilities, including consumers, to report on their compliance with regulations and past mpsc orders governing the utilities' response to outages and downed lines. consumers responded to the mpsc's order in november 2022.
additionally, as directed by the mpsc, the mpsc staff has engaged a third‐party auditor to review all equipment and operations of the two utilities' distribution systems; this audit began in august 2023. the mpsc staff released a report prepared by the third-party auditor to summarize the audit's progress in december 2023, and a final report is expected in late summer 2024. consumers is committed to working with the third‐party auditor and the mpsc to continue improving electric reliability and safety in michigan.
2023 electric rate case: in may 2023, consumers filed an application with the mpsc seeking a rate increase of $216 million, made up of two components. first, consumers requested a $207 million annual rate increase, based on an authorized return on equity of 10.25 percent for the projected 12‐month period ending february 28, 2025. the filing requested authority to recover costs related to new infrastructure investment primarily in distribution system reliability and cleaner energy resources. second, consumers requested approval of a surcharge for the recovery of $9 million of distribution investments made in 2022 that exceeded the rates authorized in accordance with the december 2021 electric rate order.
table of contents in september 2023, consumers revised its requested increase to $169 million, primarily to reflect the delay of certain capital expenditures beyond the test year. presented in the following table are the components of the revised requested increase in revenue:
in millions projected 12-month period ending february 28                          2025

pscr plan: consumers submitted its 2024 pscr plan to the mpsc in september 2023 and, in accordance with its proposed plan, self-implemented the 2024 pscr charge beginning in january 2024.
retention incentive program: under its clean energy plan, consumers will retire the j.h. campbell coal-fueled generating units in 2025. consumers implemented a retention incentive program to ensure necessary staffing at the facility through retirement. the aggregate cost of the j.h. campbell program through 2025 is estimated to be $50 million; consumers expects to recognize $10 million of retention benefit costs in 2024. the mpsc has approved deferred accounting treatment for these costs; these expenses are deferred as a regulatory asset. for additional details on this program, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 19, exit activities and discontinued operations.
electric environmental outlook: consumers' electric operations are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. consumers estimates that it will incur capital expenditures of $240 million from 2024 through 2028 to continue to comply with rcra, the clean air act, and numerous other environmental regulations. consumers expects to recover these costs in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result. multiple environmental laws and regulations are subject to litigation. consumers' primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters.
air quality: multiple air quality regulations apply, or may apply, to consumers' electric utility.
in 2012, the epa published emission standards for electric generating units, known as mats, based on section 112 of the clean air act. consumers has complied, and continues to comply, with the mats regulation, and does not expect mats to materially impact its environmental strategy.
csapr requires michigan and many other states to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that, according to epa modeling, contribute to ground-level ozone in other downwind states. since its 2015 effective date, csapr has been revised several times. in june 2023, the epa published the "good neighbor plan," a revision to csapr. this regulation tightens allowance budgets for electric generating units in michigan between 2023 and 2029 and changes the mechanism for allocating such allowances on a year-over-year basis beginning in 2026. consumers' initial evaluation of this regulation indicates that it will have minimal financial and operational impact in the near term. additionally, consumers does not expect any major financial and operational impact in the long term. however, due to the dynamic nature of this regulation, it is difficult to forecast the long-term impact.
table of contents in 2015, the epa lowered the naaqs for ozone and made it more difficult to construct or modify power plants and other emission sources in areas of the country that do not meet the ozone standard. as of may 2023, three counties in western michigan have been designated as not meeting the ozone standard. none of consumers' fossil-fuel-fired generating units are located in these areas. additionally, in january 2023, the epa proposed lowering the naaqs for particulate matter. consumers will continue to monitor naaqs rulemakings and evaluate potential impacts to its generating assets.
consumers continues to evaluate these rules in conjunction with other epa and egle rulemakings, litigation, executive orders, treaties, and congressional actions. this evaluation could result in:
•a change in consumers' fuel mix
•changes in the types of generating units consumers may purchase or build in the future
•changes in how certain units are operated, including the installation of additional emission control equipment
•the retirement, mothballing, or repowering with an alternative fuel of some of consumers' generating units
•changes in consumers' environmental compliance costs
•the purchase or sale of allowances greenhouse gases: there have been numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the state, regional, national, and international levels that involve the potential regulation and reporting of greenhouse gases. consumers continues to monitor and comment on these initiatives, as appropriate.
in may 2023, the epa released its proposed rule to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units. under its clean energy plan, consumers will eliminate the use of coal-fueled generation in 2025. therefore, this proposed rule will not materially impact consumers over the remaining operating lives of these coal-fueled facilities. the proposed rule has requirements for existing natural gas-fueled facilities that could have a material impact on consumers' natural gas-fueled facilities. the epa is scheduled to finalize the rule in april 2024.
under the paris agreement, an international agreement addressing greenhouse gas emissions, the u.s. has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. under its clean energy plan, consumers plans to reduce carbon emissions from its electric business by 60 percent from 2005 levels in 2025. at this time, consumers does not expect any adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of this event, as its plans exceed the nationally committed reduction. the commitment made by the u.s. is not binding without new congressional legislation.
in 2020, michigan's governor signed an executive order creating the michigan healthy climate plan, which outlines goals for michigan to achieve economy-wide net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and to be carbon neutral by 2050. the executive order aims for a 28‐percent reduction below 2005 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. consumers has already surpassed the 28‐percent reduction milestone for its owned electric generation and previously announced a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from its electric business by 2040. the 2023 energy law codifies much of the governor's goals. for additional details on the 2023 energy law, see the planet section of the executive overview.
increased frequency or intensity of severe or extreme weather events, including those due to climate change, could materially impact consumers' facilities, energy sales, and results of operations. consumers is unable to predict these events or their financial impact; however, consumers evaluates the potential physical impacts of climate change on its operations, including increased frequency or intensity of storm activity; increased precipitation; increased temperature; and changes in lake and river levels. consumers released a report addressing the physical risks of climate change on its infrastructure in 2022. consumers is taking steps to mitigate these risks as appropriate.
table of contents while consumers cannot predict the outcome of changes in u.s. policy or of other legislative, executive, or regulatory initiatives involving the potential regulation or reporting of greenhouse gases, it intends to move forward with its clean energy plan, its present net-zero goals, and its emphasis on reliable and resilient supply. litigation, international treaties, executive orders, federal laws and regulations (including regulations by the epa), and state laws and regulations, if enacted or ratified, could ultimately impact consumers. consumers may be required to:
•replace equipment
•install additional emission control equipment
•purchase emission allowances or credits (including potential greenhouse gas offset credits)
•curtail operations
•arrange for alternative sources of supply
•purchase or build facilities that generate fewer emissions
•mothball, sell, or retire facilities that generate certain emissions
•pursue energy efficiency or demand response measures more swiftly
•take other steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases although associated capital or operating costs relating to greenhouse gas regulation or legislation could be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, consumers expects to recover these costs in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations.
ccrs: in 2015, the epa published a rule regulating ccrs under rcra. this rule adopts minimum standards for the disposal of non‐hazardous ccrs in ccr landfills and surface impoundments and criteria for the beneficial use of ccrs. the rule also sets out conditions under which some ccr units would be forced to cease receiving ccr wastewater and initiate closure. due to continued litigation, many aspects of the rule have been remanded to the epa, resulting in more proposed and final rules.
separately, congress passed legislation in 2016 allowing participating states to develop permitting programs for ccrs under rcra subtitle d. the epa was granted authority to review these permitting programs to determine if permits issued under the proposed program would be as protective as the federal rule. once approved, permits issued from an authorized state would replace the requirement to certify compliance with each aspect of the ccr rule. in 2020, egle submitted a regulatory package for michigan's permit program to the epa for its review, which is still pending.
consumers, with agreement from egle, completed the work necessary to initiate closure by excavating ccrs or placing a final cover over each of its relevant ccr units prior to the closure initiation deadline. consumers has historically been authorized to recover in electric rates costs related to coal ash disposal sites.
water: multiple water-related regulations apply, or may apply, to consumers.
the epa regulates cooling water intake systems of existing electric generating plants under section 316(b) of the clean water act. the rules seek to reduce alleged harmful impacts on aquatic organisms, such as fish. in 2018, consumers submitted to egle for approval all required studies and recommended plans to comply with section 316(b) for its coal-fueled units, but has not yet received final approval.
the epa also regulates the discharge of wastewater through its effluent limitation guidelines for steam electric generating plants. in 2020, the epa revised previous guidelines related to the discharge of certain wastewater, but allowed for extension of the compliance deadline from the end of 2023 to the end of 2025, upon approval by egle through the npdes permitting process. consumers received such an table of contents extension to 2025 for its j.h. campbell generating facility, which it plans to retire in 2025. in march 2023, the epa released a proposed rule seeking to replace its 2020 rule and corresponding effluent limitation guidelines. consumers is evaluating the proposed effluent limitation guidelines for its potential impacts on its generating facilities.
in recent years, the epa and the u.s. army corps of engineers have proposed changes to the scope of federal jurisdiction over bodies of water and to the frequency of dual jurisdiction in states with authority to regulate the same waters; michigan is one such state. a 2022 rule changed the definition of "waters of the united states," which defines the scope of waters protected under the clean water act. additionally, in may 2023, the u.s. supreme court issued a decision reducing the scope of "waters of the united states." consumers does not expect adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of the current interpretations and court decision.
many of consumers' facilities maintain npdes permits, which are vital to the facilities' operations. consumers applies for renewal of these permits every five years. failure of egle to renew any npdes permit, a successful appeal against a permit, a change in the interpretation or scope of npdes permitting, or onerous terms contained in a permit could have a significant detrimental effect on the operations of a facility.
protected wildlife: multiple regulations apply, or may apply, to consumers relating to protected species and habitats.
statutes like the federal endangered species act, the migratory bird treaty act, and the bald and golden eagle protection act of 1940 may impact operations at consumers' facilities. in 2021, the u.s. fish and wildlife service announced its intent to regulate incidental take under the migratory bird treaty act. any resulting permitting and monitoring fees and/or restrictions on operations could impact consumers' existing and future operations, including wind and solar generation facilities.
additionally, consumers is monitoring proposed changes to the listing status of several species within its operational area due to an increase in wildlife-related regulatory activity at federal and state levels. a change in species listed under the endangered species act may impact consumers' costs to mitigate its impact on protected species and habitats at certain existing facilities as well as siting choices for new facilities.
other matters: other electric environmental matters could have a material impact on consumers' outlook. for additional details on other electric environmental matters, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 3, contingencies and commitments-consumers electric utility contingencies-electric environmental matters.
consumers gas utility outlook and uncertainties gas deliveries: consumers' gas customer deliveries are seasonal. the peak demand for natural gas occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel.
over the next five years, consumers expects weather-normalized gas deliveries to remain stable relative to 2023. this outlook reflects the effects of energy waste reduction programs offset by modest growth in gas demand. actual delivery levels will depend on:
•weather fluctuations
•use by power producers
•availability and development of renewable energy sources table of contents
•gas price changes
•michigan's economic conditions, including population trends and housing activity

1consumers has proposed to share voluntarily half of the gain to be recognized on the sale of its unregulated appliance service plan program (discussed below).
gain sharing application: in february 2024, consumers signed an agreement to sell its unregulated appliance service plan program to a non-affiliated company; this sale is expected to close in the first half of 2024. also in february 2024, consumers filed an application requesting the mpsc's approval to share voluntarily with customers half of the gain, net of transaction costs, to be recognized on this sale. in consumers' 2023 gas rate case, it has proposed sharing the gain with customers over five years in the form of a surcharge credit.
gcr plan: consumers submitted its 2024‐2025 gcr plan to the mpsc in december 2023 and, in accordance with its proposed plan, expects to self-implement the 2024‐2025 gcr charge beginning in april 2024.
gas pipeline and storage integrity and safety: the u.s. department of transportation's pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration has published various rules that expand federal safety standards for gas transmission pipelines and underground storage facilities. initial expanded requirements for transmission pipelines took effect in 2020, with additional requirements released in 2023. there are also proposed rules expanding requirements for gas distribution systems pending. to comply with these rules, consumers will incur increased capital and operating and maintenance costs to install and remediate pipelines and to expand inspections, maintenance, and monitoring of its existing pipelines and storage facilities.
table of contents although associated capital or operating and maintenance costs relating to these regulations could be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, consumers expects to recover such costs in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with laws and regulations.
gas environmental outlook: consumers expects to incur response activity costs at a number of sites, including 23 former mgp sites. for additional details, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 3, contingencies and commitments-consumers gas utility contingencies-gas environmental matters.
consumers' gas operations are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. multiple environmental laws and regulations are subject to litigation. consumers' primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters.
air quality: multiple air quality regulations apply, or may apply, to consumers' gas utility.
in june 2023, the epa published the "good neighbor plan," a revision to csapr that impacts michigan. this regulation will reduce interstate air pollution transport issues that epa modeling suggests contribute to downwind states attaining or maintaining compliance with the naaqs for ozone. while prior csapr regulations focused only on electric generating units, this latest rule includes other emission sources, including some engines used at compressor stations. consumers has determined that the revised csapr regulation does not apply to consumers' natural gas compressor station engines.
in 2015, the epa lowered the naaqs for ozone and made it more difficult to construct or modify natural gas compressor stations and other emission sources in areas of the country that do not meet the ozone standard. as of may 2023, three counties in western michigan have been designated as not meeting the ozone standard. one of consumers' compressor stations is located in an ozone nonattainment area. consequently, consumers has initiated plans to retrofit equipment at this compressor station to lower nox emissions and comply with a rule proposed by the state of michigan, as required for a source located in a moderate ozone nonattainment area. additionally, in january 2023, the epa proposed lowering the naaqs for particulate matter. consumers will continue to monitor naaqs rulemakings and evaluate potential impacts to its compressor stations and other applicable natural gas storage and delivery assets.
greenhouse gases: there is increasing interest at the federal, state, and local levels in potential regulation of greenhouse gases or their sources. such regulation, if adopted, may involve requirements to reduce methane emissions from consumers' gas utility operations and carbon dioxide emissions from customer use of natural gas. no such measures apply to consumers at this time.
in 2020, michigan's governor signed an executive order creating the michigan healthy climate plan, which outlines goals for michigan to achieve economy-wide net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and to be carbon neutral by 2050. the executive order aims for a 28‐percent reduction below 2005 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. for additional details on the executive order, see consumers electric utility outlook and uncertainties-electric environmental outlook.
under the paris agreement, an international agreement addressing greenhouse gas emissions, the u.s. has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. the commitment made by the u.s. is not binding without new congressional legislation. consumers continues to monitor these initiatives and comment as appropriate. consumers cannot predict the impact of any potential future legislation or regulation on its gas utility.
consumers is making voluntary efforts to reduce its gas utility's methane emissions. under its methane reduction plan, consumers has set a goal of net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas delivery table of contents system by 2030. consumers plans to reduce methane emissions from its system by about 80 percent, from 2012 baseline levels, by accelerating the replacement of aging pipe, rehabilitating or retiring outdated infrastructure, and adopting new technologies and practices. the remaining emissions will likely be offset by purchasing and/or producing renewable natural gas. to date, consumers has reduced methane emissions by more than 25 percent.
in march 2022, consumers also announced a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target for its entire natural gas system by 2050. this includes suppliers and customers, and has an interim goal of reducing customer emissions by 20 percent by 2030. consumers' natural gas delivery plan, a rolling ten‐year investment plan to deliver safe, reliable, clean, and affordable natural gas to customers, outlines ways in which consumers can make early progress toward these goals in a cost-effective manner, including energy waste reduction, carbon offsets, and renewable natural gas supply.
consumers has already initiated work in these key areas, continuing to expand its energy waste reduction targets, launching a program allowing gas customers to purchase carbon offset credits on a voluntary basis, and announcing plans to begin development of renewable natural gas facilities that will capture methane from manure generated at michigan-based farms and convert it into renewable natural gas. consumers is evaluating and monitoring newer technologies to determine their role in achieving consumers' interim and long-term net-zero goals, including hydrogen, biofuels, and synthetic methane; carbon capture sequestration systems; and other innovative technologies.
northstar clean energy outlook and uncertainties cms energy's primary focus with respect to its northstar clean energy businesses is to maximize the value of generating assets, its share of which represents 1,658 mw of capacity, and to pursue opportunities for the development of renewable generation projects.
during 2023, northstar clean energy sold a class a membership interest in newport solar holdings to tax equity investors for $86 million. newport solar holdings wholly owns newport solar, a 180‐mw solar generation project located in jackson county, arkansas; the project began commercial operation in october 2023. all of the project's nameplate capacity has been committed under a 15‐year ppa. northstar clean energy retained a class b membership interest in newport solar holdings. earnings, tax attributes, and cash flows generated by newport solar holdings will be allocated among and distributed to the membership classes in accordance with the ratios specified in the associated limited liability company operating agreement; these ratios change over time and are not representative of the ownership interest percentages of each membership class. for additional details, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 18, variable interest entities.
northstar clean energy's operations may be subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. multiple environmental laws and regulations are subject to litigation. northstar clean energy's primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters.
csapr requires michigan and many other states to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that, according to epa modeling, contribute to ground-level ozone in other downwind states. since its 2015 effective date, csapr has been revised several times. in june 2023, the epa published the "good neighbor plan," a revision to csapr. this regulation tightens allowance budgets for electric generating units in michigan between 2023 and 2029 and changes the mechanism for allocating such allowances on a year-over-year basis beginning in 2026. northstar clean energy may incur increased costs to purchase allowances or retrofit equipment.

in may 2023, the epa released its proposed rule to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired and natural gas-fueled electric generating units. this proposed regulation could have a material financial and operational impact on northstar clean energy, if the regulation ultimately applies to its facilities. the epa is scheduled to finalize the rule in april 2024.
many of northstar clean energy's facilities maintain npdes permits, which are vital to the facilities' operations. northstar clean energy applies for renewal of these permits every five years. failure of egle to renew any npdes permit, a successful appeal against a permit, a change in the interpretation or scope of npdes permitting, or onerous terms contained in a permit could have a significant detrimental effect on the operations of a facility.
trends, uncertainties, and other matters related to northstar clean energy that could have a material impact on cms energy's consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position include:
•investment in and financial benefits received from renewable energy and energy storage projects
•changes in energy and capacity prices
•severe weather events and climate change associated with increasing levels of greenhouse gases
•changes in commodity prices on certain derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and must be marked to market through earnings
•changes in various environmental laws, regulations, principles, or practices, or in their interpretation
•indemnity obligations assumed in connection with ownership interests in facilities that involve tax equity financing
•representations, warranties, and indemnities provided by cms energy in connection with sales of assets
•delays or difficulties in obtaining environmental permits for facilities located in areas associated with environmental justice concerns for additional details regarding northstar clean energy's uncertainties, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 3, contingencies and commitments-guarantees.
other outlook and uncertainties litigation: cms energy, consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries are named as parties in various litigation matters, as well as in administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies, arising in the ordinary course of business. for additional details regarding these and other legal matters, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 2, regulatory matters and note 3, contingencies and commitments.
employee separation program: in april 2023, cms energy and consumers announced a voluntary separation program for non‐union employees. for the year ended december 31, 2023, cms energy and consumers recorded a pre-tax charge of $33 million related to the program, under which more than 400 employees were approved for and accepted early separation.
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the following information is important to understand cms energy's and consumers' results of operations and financial condition. for additional accounting policies, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 1, significant accounting policies.
in the preparation of cms energy's and consumers' consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions are used that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. cms energy and consumers use accounting estimates for asset valuations, unbilled revenue, depreciation, amortization, financial and derivative instruments, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, the effects of regulation, indemnities, contingencies, and aros. actual results may differ from estimated results due to changes in the regulatory environment, regulatory decisions, lawsuits, competition, and other factors. cms energy and consumers consider all relevant factors in making these assessments.
accounting for the effects of industry regulation: because consumers has regulated operations, it uses regulatory accounting to recognize the effects of the regulators' decisions on its financial statements. consumers continually assesses whether future recovery of its regulatory assets is probable by considering communications and experience with its regulators and changes in the regulatory environment. if consumers determined that recovery of a regulatory asset were not probable, consumers would be required to write off the asset and immediately recognize the expense in earnings. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 2, regulatory matters.
contingencies: cms energy and consumers make judgments regarding the future outcome of various matters that give rise to contingent liabilities. for such matters, they record liabilities when they are considered probable and reasonably estimable, based on all available information. in particular, cms energy and consumers are participating in various environmental remediation projects for which they have recorded liabilities. the recorded amounts represent estimates that may take into account such considerations as the number of sites, the anticipated scope, cost, and timing of remediation work, the available technology, applicable regulations, and the requirements of governmental authorities. for remediation projects in which the timing of estimated expenditures is considered reliably determinable, cms energy and consumers record the liability at its net present value, using a discount rate equal to the interest rate on monetary assets that are essentially risk-free and have maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability. the amount recorded for any contingency may differ from actual costs incurred when the contingency is resolved. for additional details, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 3, contingencies and commitments.
derivative instruments: cms energy and consumers account for certain contracts as derivative instruments. if a contract is a derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, it is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value. for the ftrs at consumers, changes in fair value are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities.
the criteria used to determine if an instrument qualifies for derivative accounting or for an exception from derivative accounting are complex and often require judgment in application. changes in business strategies or market conditions, as well as a requirement to apply different interpretations of the derivative accounting literature, could result in changes in accounting for a single contract or groups of contracts, which could have a material impact on cms energy's and consumers' financial statements. for additional details on cms energy's and consumers' derivatives and how the fair values of derivatives are table of contents determined, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 5, fair value measurements.
income taxes: the amount of income taxes paid by cms energy is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. an estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. cms energy believes adequate reserves have been provided for these exposures; however, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. additionally, cms energy's judgment as to the ability to recover its deferred tax assets may change. cms energy believes the valuation allowances related to its deferred tax assets are adequate, but future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments. as a result, cms energy's effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly over time. for additional details, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 12, income taxes.
pension and opeb: cms energy and consumers provide retirement pension benefits to certain employees under non‐contributory db pension plans, and they provide postretirement health and life benefits to qualifying retired employees under an opeb plan.
cms energy and consumers record liabilities for pension and opeb on their consolidated balance sheets at the present value of the future obligations, net of any plan assets. the calculation of the liabilities and associated expenses requires the expertise of actuaries, and requires many assumptions, including:
•life expectancies
•discount rates
•expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
•rate of compensation increases
•expected health care costs a change in these assumptions could change significantly cms energy's and consumers' recorded liabilities and associated expenses.
presented in the following table are estimates of credits and cash contributions through 2026 for the db pension plans and opeb plan. actual future costs, credits, and contributions will depend on future investment performance, discount rates, and various factors related to the participants of the db pension plans and opeb plan. cms energy and consumers will, at a minimum, contribute to the plans as needed to comply with federal funding requirements.

1consumers' pension and opeb costs are recoverable through its general ratemaking process.
table of contents lowering the expected long-term rate of return on the assets of the db pension plans by 25 basis points would increase estimated pension cost for 2024 by $8 million for both cms energy and consumers. lowering the pbo discount rates by 25 basis points would decrease estimated pension cost for 2024 by $1 million for both cms energy and consumers. pension and opeb costs above or below the amounts used to set existing rates will be deferred as a regulatory asset or liability in accordance with consumers' postretirement benefits expense deferral mechanism; for more information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 2, regulatory matters.
pension and opeb plan assets are accounted for and disclosed at fair value. fair value measurements incorporate assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. development of these assumptions may require judgment.
for additional details on postretirement benefits, including the fair value measurements for the assets of the db pension plans and opeb plan, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 10, retirement benefits.
unbilled revenues: consumers' customers are billed monthly in cycles having billing dates that do not generally coincide with the end of a calendar month. this results in customers having received electricity or natural gas that they have not been billed for as of the month-end. consumers estimates its unbilled revenues by applying an average billed rate to total unbilled deliveries for each customer class. consumers records unbilled revenues as accounts receivable and accrued revenue on its consolidated balance sheet. for additional information on unbilled revenues, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-notes to the consolidated financial statements-note 14, revenue.
new accounting standards there are no new accounting standards issued but not yet effective that are expected to have a material impact on cms energy's or consumers' consolidated financial statements.

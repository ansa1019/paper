item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following section generally discusses 2023 results compared to 2022 results. discussion of 2022 results compared to 2021 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in part ii, item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022.
business overview and 2023 highlights we are a global energy technology company. we deliver smart, easy-to-use solutions that manage solar generation, storage and communication on one platform. our intelligent microinverters work with virtually every solar panel made, and when paired with our smart technology, results in one of the industry's best-performing clean energy systems. as of december 31, 2023, we have shipped more than 73.0 million microinverters, and approximately 4.0 million enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in more than 150 countries.
we sell primarily to solar distributors who combine our products with others, including solar modules products and racking systems, and resell to installers in each target region. in addition to our solar distributors, we sell directly to select large installers, oems and strategic partners. our oem customers include solar module manufacturers who integrate our microinverters with their solar module products and resell to both distributors and installers. strategic partners include providers of solar financing solutions. we also sell certain products and services to homeowners primarily in support of our warranty services and legacy product upgrade programs, via our online store.
during the fiscal year 2023, we began shipments of microinverters from our contract manufacturers in the united states. moving manufacturing to the united states allows us to take advantage of the benefits of the ira as well as helps us better serve our customers by cutting down delivery times and diversifying our supply chain.
global events affecting our business and operations as we have a growing global footprint, we are subject to risk and exposure from the evolving macroeconomic environment, including the effects of increased global inflationary pressures and interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, potential economic slowdowns or recessions, and geopolitical pressures, including the unknown impacts of current and future trade regulations and the armed conflicts in ukraine, the gaza strip and nearby areas. we continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results.
demand for products. the demand environment for our products experienced a broad-based slowdown beginning in the second quarter of 2023 in the united states and in the third quarter of 2023 in europe that continued into the fourth quarter. this resulted in elevated inventory with distributors and installers, and as a result we sold fewer microinverters to distributors and installers during the second half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2023 as they responded to this slower demand environment. in the united states, this slowdown was primarily the result of higher interest rates and the transition from nem 2.0 to nem 3.0 in california, which has increased the payback period for our customers in california. in europe, this slowdown was primarily the result of a decrease in purchases in the second half of 2023 after the initial surge of sales related to onset of the armed conflict in ukraine in 2022, and overall channel inventory correction. in addition, there has been increased uncertainty in net energy metering policies and solar export penalties in a key european market, which resulted in lower sales in that region. we expect these trends to continue to have an adverse effect on our revenue in 2024.
in light of the slowdown in demand, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we implemented the 2023 restructuring plan to reduce our operating costs, and better align our cost structure with current market conditions, strategic priorities and our ongoing commitment to profitable growth. as part of the 2023 restructuring plan, we are reducing our global workforce by approximately 10% and plan to cease operations at our contract manufacturing locations in romania and wisconsin, united states, and resize our other contract manufacturing sites, to be closer aligned to expected demand.

table of contents also extended until 2032 to allow a qualifying homeowner to deduct 30% of the cost of installing residential solar systems from their u.s. federal income taxes, thereby returning a material portion of the purchase price of the residential solar system to homeowners. under the terms of the current extension, the itc will remain at 30% through the end of 2032, reduce to 26% for 2033, reduce to 22% for 2034, and further reduce to 0% after the end of 2034 for residential solar systems, unless it is extended before that time. we believe the enactment of the ira is favorable to our overall business.
in december 2022, the cpuc approved and voted for nem 3.0, which has been effective since april 15, 2023. the new policy reduces the compensation earned by solar customers selling extra energy to the grid by a substantial amount. the average export rate in california under nem 3.0 is approximately $0.05/kwh to $0.08/kwh compared to the prior average of $0.25/kwh to $0.35/kwh under nem 2.0. in november 2023, the cpuc also adopted changes to its virtual nem and nem aggregation programs that prohibit the netting of import energy charges at multi-meter commercial or agricultural properties with solar energy generated at or adjacent to those properties, except for residential account holders in a multi-family residential property. both of these policy changes in california reduced demand for solar pv systems in the year ended december 31, 2023 and may continue to do so for future inverter sales. however, the reduction in export compensation under nem 3.0, coupled with rising utility rates, may encourage deployment of battery energy storage with solar pv systems and mitigate some of the demand reductions components of consolidated statements of operations net revenues we generate revenue from sales of our solutions, which include microinverter and related accessories, an iq gateway and iq energy router, cloud-based monitoring services, storage solutions, ev charging solutions, design, proposal, permitting and lead generation services, as well as a platform matching cleantech asset owners to a local and on-demand workforce of service providers, distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners.
our revenue is affected by changes in the volume and asps of our solutions and related accessories, supply and demand, sales incentives and competitive product offerings. our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace by remaining cost competitive, macroeconomic conditions, favorable regulatory environment, developing and introducing new products that meet the changing technology, and performance requirements of our customers, the diversification and expansion of our revenue base, and our ability to market our products in a manner that increases awareness for microinverter technology and differentiates us in the marketplace.
cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues is comprised primarily of product costs, warranty, manufacturing support personnel and logistics costs, freight costs, inventory write-downs, hosting services costs related to our enlighten service offering, lead acquisition costs, design and proposal services, depreciation and amortization of manufacturing test equipment, amortization of capitalized software development costs related to our enlighten service offering and design and proposal services, employee-related expenses associated with proposal and permitting services and design and proposal service customer support. amptc earned under the ira for u.s. manufactured microinverters shipped to customers in the year ended december 31, 2023 are treated as a reduction to cost of revenues based on our interpretation of the most current guidance.
our product costs are impacted by technological innovations, such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions, economies of scale resulting in lower component costs, and improvements in production processes and automation. certain costs, primarily personnel and depreciation and amortization of test equipment, are not directly affected by sales volume.
we outsource our manufacturing to third-party contract manufacturers and generally negotiate product pricing with them on a quarterly basis. we believe our contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products for the foreseeable future. however, shortages in the supply of certain key raw materials could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products. we contract with third parties, including one of our contract manufacturers, to serve as our logistics providers by warehousing and delivering our products in the united states, canada, mexico, europe, australia, new zealand, india, brazil, the philippines, thailand, south africa, and certain other central american and asian markets.

table of contents gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our asps, product cost, product mix, customer mix, amptc, shipping costs, warranty costs and sales volume fluctuations resulting from seasonality.
operating expenses operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative and restructuring and asset impairment charges. personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories, other than restructuring and asset impairment charges, and include salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, sales commissions, incentive compensation, post-combination expense and stock-based compensation.
research and development expense includes personnel-related expenses, third-party design and development costs, testing and evaluation costs, depreciation expense and other indirect costs. research and development employees are primarily engaged in the design and development of power electronics, semiconductors, powerline communications, networking and software functionality, and storage. we devote substantial resources to research and development programs that focus on enhancements to, and cost efficiencies in, our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation to drive down product costs, improve functionality, and enhance reliability. we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources in our research and development efforts because we believe they are critical to maintaining our competitive position.
sales and marketing expense includes personnel-related expenses, travel, trade shows, marketing, customer support and other indirect costs. we expect to continue to make the necessary investments to enable us to execute our strategy to increase our market penetration geographically and enter into new markets by expanding our customer base of distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners. we currently offer solutions targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states, canada, mexico, europe, australia, new zealand, india, brazil, the philippines, thailand, south africa and certain other central american and asian markets. we expect to continue to expand the geographic reach of our product offerings and explore new sales channels in addressable markets in the future.
general and administrative expense includes personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, facilities costs, and fees for professional services. fees for professional services consist primarily of outside legal, accounting and information technology consulting costs.
restructuring and asset impairment charges are the net charges resulting from restructuring initiatives implemented in 2022 and 2023 to increase operational efficiencies and execution, reduce operating costs, and better align our workforce and cost structure with current market conditions, as well as reflect our business needs, strategic priorities and ongoing commitment to profitable growth. under the 2023 restructuring plan, costs included in restructuring and asset impairment charges primarily consisted of employee severance and one-time benefits, workforce reorganization charges and asset impairment charges. refer to note 12. "restructuring and asset impairment charges," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, amortization of discount or premium on purchase of cash equivalents and marketable securities, gains or losses upon conversion of foreign currency transactions into u.s. dollars, interest expense, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, non-cash interest expense related to the accretion of debt discount and amortization of deferred financing costs, non-cash charges recognized for loss on partial settlement of convertible notes, and the change in fair value of our debt securities.
income tax benefit (provision)
we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we sell our products. historically, we have primarily been subject to taxation in the united states because we have sold the majority of our products to customers in the united states. as we have expanded the sale of products to customers outside the united states, we have become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place. as sales in foreign jurisdictions increase in the future, our effective tax rate may fluctuate accordingly. we regularly assess the ability to realize deferred tax assets based on the weight of all available evidence, including such factors as the history of recent earnings and expected future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.

net revenues decreased by 2%, or $40.1 million, in the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022, driven primarily by a decrease in shipments of iq batteries to 351.6 megawatt-hour ("mwh") in the year ended december 31, 2023, from 508.5 mwh shipped in the year ended december 31, 2022. the decrease in total net revenues was partially offset by an increase in asp for microinverters, primarily the result of a favorable product mix as we sold more iq8 microinverters relative to iq7tm microinverters as well as a slight increase in the volume of microinverter units shipped. we sold approximately 15.5 million microinverter units in the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to approximately 15.4 million units in the year ended december 31, 2022. the overall decrease in net revenues is due to a broad-based slowdown beginning in the second quarter of 2023 in the united states and the third quarter of 2023 in europe that resulted in elevated inventory with distributors and installers, and as a result we sold fewer microinverters to distributors and installers during the second half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2023, as distributors and installers responded to this slower demand environment. in the united states, this slowdown was primarily the result of higher interest rates and the transition from nem 2.0 to nem 3.0 in california increasing the payback period for our customers. in europe, this slowdown was primarily the result of a decrease in purchases after the initial surge of sales related to the onset of the armed conflict in ukraine in 2022, and overall channel inventory correction. in addition, there has been increased uncertainty in net energy metering policies and solar export penalties in a key european market.

cost of revenues decreased by 9%, or $123.9 million, in the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to lower volume of shipments of iq batteries as well as the recognition of credits of $53.5 million under the amptc for u.s. manufactured microinverters shipped to customers during the year ended december 31, 2023.
gross margin increased by 4.4 percentage points in the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022. the increase was primarily due to the benefit recognized from tax credits under the amptc of approximately 2.3 percentage points, an increase in asp driven by a favorable product mix as we sold more iq8 microinverters relative to iq7 microinverters in the year ended december 31, 2023, and also due to cost management improvements, which included lower shipping costs.

general and administrative expense decreased by 2%, or $2.2 million, in the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022. the decrease was primarily due to $11.3 million of lower personnel-related expenses, primarily related to $10.4 million lower stock-based compensation due to lower estimated achievement with performance stock units granted in 2023, offset by $5.6 million of higher legal and professional services and $3.5 million higher facility costs to support scalability of our business expansion.

restructuring and asset impairment charges are the net charges resulting from restructuring initiatives implemented in 2022 and 2023. we implemented the 2023 restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2023 to increase operational efficiencies, reduce operating costs, and to better align our workforce and cost structure with current market conditions, our business needs, and strategic priorities.
restructuring charges of $15.7 million in the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily consisted of $9.7 million of asset impairment charges, $3.7 million of contract termination charges and $1.4 million of employee severance and one-time benefits. restructuring charges of $2.4 million in the year ended december 31, 2022, primarily consisted of one-time termination benefits and other employee-related expenses.

interest income of $69.7 million in the year ended december 31, 2023 increased, as compared to $13.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in interest rates earned and a higher average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance in the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022.
interest expense of $8.8 million in the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily included $8.4 million for the coupon interest, debt discount amortization with the notes due 2025 and amortization of debt issuance costs with the notes due 2023, notes due 2025, notes due 2026 and notes due 2028, and $0.4 million interest incurred with the notes due 2025 and the notes due 2023. interest expense of $9.4 million in the year ended december 31, 2022, primarily related to $9.2 million for the coupon interest expense, debt discount amortization with the notes due 2025, amortization of debt issuance costs with the notes due 2023, notes due 2025, notes due 2026 and notes due 2028, and $0.2 million accretion of interest expense on contingent consideration for an acquisition.
other income (expense), net of $6.5 million in the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily related to $8.7 million non-cash net gain related to change in the fair value of debt securities, partially offset by $2.1 million net loss due to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and $0.1 million in realized loss on investments. other income (expense), net of $0.4 million in the year ended december 31, 2022, primarily related to a $0.9 million net loss due to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and a $0.3 million impairment of a note receivable, partially offset by a $0.7 million non-cash net gain related to a change in the fair value of debt securities and $0.1 million in interest income.

the income tax provision was $74.2 million in the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to $54.7 million in the same period in 2022. the increase was primarily due to higher projected tax expense in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions that are more profitable in 2023 compared to 2022, combined with a lower tax deduction from employee stock-based compensation in 2023 compared to 2022.
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as of december 31, 2023, we had $1.9 billion in net working capital, including cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.7 billion, of which approximately $1.7 billion were held in the united states. our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily consist of u.s. treasuries, money market mutual funds, corporate notes, commercial paper and bonds and both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits, with the remainder held in various foreign subsidiaries. we consider amounts held outside the united states to be accessible and have provided for the estimated income tax liability on the repatriation of our foreign earnings.

our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $82.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to cash generated from operations, partially offset by cash used to fund investments in private companies, repurchases of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program and payments of withholding taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards.
total carrying amount of debt increased by $3.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to $8.4 million accretion of debt discount and issuance costs, partially offset by the $5.0 million for the notes due 2023 that were converted into shares of our common stock.
we expect that our principal short-term (over the next 12 months) and long-term cash needs related to our operations will be used to fund working capital, strategic investments, acquisitions, repurchases of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program and payments of withholding taxes for net share settlement of equity awards, make payments on our outstanding debt and the purchases of property and equipment. we plan to fund any cash requirements for the next 12 months and the long term from our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand, and cash generated from operations. we anticipate that access to the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years as interest rates have increased and are expected to remain high. our ability to obtain debt or any other additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing.
repurchase of common stock. in july 2023, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program (the "2023 repurchase program") pursuant to which we were authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. the repurchases could be funded from available working capital and could be executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through rule 10b5-1 plans. the program may be discontinued or amended at any time and expires on july 26, 2026. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we repurchased 3,284,368 shares for an aggregate amount of $410.0 million. refer to note 15. "stockholders' equity," in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information on our repurchase of common stock.
convertible notes. as of december 31, 2023, our aggregate principal convertible notes obligations were $1,309.7 million which primarily consisted of the notes due 2028 of $575.0 million, notes due 2026 of $632.5 million and notes due 2025 of $102.2 million. upon conversion of the notes due 2025, notes due 2026 and notes due 2028, we will pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the notes of such series to be converted, and, at our election, will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes of such series. during the annual period ended december 31, 2023, we received a request for the conversion of $2.0 thousand in the principal amount of the notes due 2025, of which we have elected to settle the aggregate principal amount of the notes due 2025 in a combination of cash and any excess in shares of our common stock in accordance with the applicable indenture. such conversion is expected to be settled in february 2024. refer to note 13. "debt," in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information on our outstanding convertible notes.
operating leases. we have entered into various non-cancelable operating leases primarily for our facilities with original lease periods expiring through the year 2033, with the most significant leases relating to our offices in petaluma, california and bengaluru, india. as of december 31, 2023, we had total operating lease obligations of $29.5 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
other material cash requirements. as of december 31, 2023, we had open purchase obligations of $184.4 million related to component inventory that our primary contract manufacturers procure on our behalf in accordance with our production forecast as well as other inventory related purchase commitments. the timing of purchases in future periods could differ materially from estimates presented above due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions.

cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the broad-based slowdown in demand for our products, new regulations and other risk factors discussed in part i, item ia, risk factors of this annual report on form 10-k.
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the continuing market acceptance of our products and macroeconomic events, such as the impacts from inflation, and increase in interest rates. we may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.
cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities consisted of our net income adjusted for certain non-cash reconciling items, such as stock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense, change in the fair value of debt securities, deferred income taxes, asset impairment, depreciation and amortization, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $48.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to higher operating expenses as we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business.
cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities of $366.4 million was primarily from the purchase of $241.0 million of marketable securities, net of sale and maturities, $110.4 million used in purchases of test and assembly equipment to expand our supply capacity, related facility improvements and information technology enhancements, including capitalized costs related to internal-use software, and $15.0 million used in the investment in a private company.

for the year ended december 31, 2022, net cash used by financing activities of approximately $17.1 million was primarily from the payment of $27.5 million in employee withholding taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by $10.4 million net proceeds from employee stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of acquired intangible assets and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. the sec has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below.
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to inflation, interest rates fluctuations and new regulations. as of the date of issuance of these financial statements, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require us to update our estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. for a description of our significant accounting policies, refer to note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we generate revenue from sales of our solutions, which include microinverter units and related accessories, an iq gateway and iq energy router, cloud-based enlighten monitoring services, storage solutions, ev charging solutions, design, proposal, permitting and lead generation services, as well as a platform matching cleantech asset owners to a local and on-demand workforce of service providers, distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners.
revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. we generate all of our revenues from contracts with our customers. a description of principal activities from which we generate revenues are follows.
•products delivered at a point in time. we sell our products and professional services to customers in accordance with the terms of the related customer contracts. we generate revenues from sales of our solutions, which include microinverter units and related accessories, storage solutions, ev charging solutions, design, proposal, permitting and lead generation services, as well as a platform matching cleantech asset owners to a local and on-demand workforce of service providers to distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners. microinverter units, microinverter accessories, storage and ev solutions, design proposal, permitting and lead generation services, as well as completed work orders on our platform matching cleantech asset owners to a local and on-demand workforce of service providers, are delivered to customers at a point in time, and we recognize revenue for these products or professional services when we transfer control of the product or professional services to the customer, which is generally upon product shipment or service delivery, respectively.
•products delivered over time. the sale of an iq gateway and iq energy router includes our enlighten cloud-based monitoring service. the full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation and is deferred at the sale date and recognized over the estimated service period of 7 years. we also sell certain communication accessories that contain a service performance obligation to be delivered over time. the revenue from these products is recognized over the related service period, which is typically 5 years. the subscription services revenue generated from each customer's subscription to our design and proposal service is recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. the subscription contracts are generally 3 to 12 months in length and billed in advance.

table of contents when we sell a product with more than one performance obligation, such as our iq combiner, which includes both hardware and the iq gateway, the total consideration is allocated to these performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices.
we record certain contra revenue promotions as variable consideration and recognize these promotions at the time the related revenue is recorded.
we record upfront contract acquisition costs, such as sales commissions, to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the asset. for contracts that have a duration of less than one year, we follow the topic 606 practical expedient and expense these costs when incurred. commissions related to the sale of monitoring hardware and services are capitalized and amortized over the period of the associated revenue.
refer to note 3. "revenue recognition," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information related to revenue recognition.
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. market is current replacement cost (by purchase or by reproduction, dependent on the type of inventory). in cases where market exceeds net realizable value (i.e., estimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal), inventories are stated at net realizable value. market is not considered to be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin. we determine cost on a first-in first-out basis. certain factors could affect the realizable value of its inventory, including customer demand and market conditions. management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis and writes down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand, anticipated sales price, effect of new product introductions, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors. inventory write-downs are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and market.
government grants government grants represent benefits provided by federal, state, or local governments that are not subject to the scope of asc 740. we recognize a grant when we have reasonable assurance that we will comply with the grant's conditions and that the grant will be received. government grants that are not related to long-lived assets are considered income-based grants, which are recognized as a reduction to the related cost of activities that generated the benefit. we recognized credits under amptc as a reduction to cost of revenues in the consolidated statement of operations for the microinverters manufactured in the united states and sold to customers in the year ended december 31, 2023. such credit is also reflected as a reduction of income tax payable on our consolidated balance sheet within accrued liabilities.
fair value of financial instruments the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. the carrying amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. equity investments with readily determinable fair value are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices or estimated based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost less impairment, and are adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.

table of contents warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. the key estimates used by us to estimate our warranty liability are: (1) the number of units expected to fail and returned for replacement over time (i.e., return rate); and (2) the per unit cost of replacement units, including outbound shipping and limited labor costs, expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time (i.e., replacement cost).
estimated return rates - our quality and reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated return rates for each generation of product. to establish initial return rate estimates for each generation of product, our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mean time between failure estimates for individual components contained in that generation of product, third-party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our product are installed, and rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the product in a short period of time. as units are deployed into operating environments, we continue to monitor product performance through our enlighten monitoring platform. it typically takes three to nine months between the date of sale and date of end-user installation. consequently, our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three to nine months. when a product fails and is returned, we perform diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanism(s) causing the failure. we then use the results of this analysis (combined with the actual, cumulative performance data collected on those units prior to failure through enlighten) to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanism(s) will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base.
as the vast majority of our microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications, we believe that warranty return rates will be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file a return than the homeowners who originally purchased the microinverters.
estimated replacement costs - three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost: (1) the estimated cost of replacement products; (2) the estimated cost to ship replacement products to end users; and (3) the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third-party installers, or estimated labor cost expected to be incurred for field service technicians, performing replacement services for the end user. because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective products over long periods of time (typically between 5 to 25 years, depending on the product and the generation of that product purchased), the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost. estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable, market-based shipping costs paid by us to third-party freight carriers. we have a separate program that allows third-party installers to claim fixed-dollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed units for a limited time from the date of original installation. included in our estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixed-dollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third-party installers over the limited offering period.
in addition to the key estimates noted above, we also compare actual warranty results to expected results and evaluate any significant differences. we may make additional adjustments to the warranty provision based on performance trends or other qualitative factors. if actual return rates, or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods, changes to these estimates may be required, resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations. such increases or decreases could be material.
fair value option for microinverters and other products sold since january 1, 2014
our warranty obligations related to products sold since january 1, 2014 provide us the right, but not the requirement, to assign our warranty obligations to a third party. under accounting standards codification 825, "financial instruments" (also referred to as the "fair value option"), an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes the eligible item. we made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with products sold since january 1, 2014 at fair value. this election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years.

table of contents we estimate the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to january 1, 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result. the expected present value technique, an income approach, converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount. in addition to the key estimates of return rates, and replacement costs, we used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on our credit-adjusted risk-free rate. refer to note 11. "fair value measurements," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
commitments and contingencies in the normal course of business, we are subject to loss contingencies and loss recoveries, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business as well as tariff refunds. an accrual for a loss contingency or loss recovery is recognized when it is probable and the amount of loss or recovery can be reasonably estimated. refer to note 14. "commitments and contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
business combinations assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired also requires us to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. accounting for business acquisitions requires us to make judgments as to whether a purchase transaction is a multiple element contract, meaning that it includes other transaction components. this judgment and determination affect the amount of consideration paid that is allocable to assets and liabilities acquired in the business purchase transaction. additional information existing as of the acquisition date but unknown to us may become known during the remainder of the measurement period, not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date, which may result in changes to the amounts and allocations recorded.
intangible assets intangible assets include patents and other purchased intangible assets. intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, with estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 9 years. indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and are also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the asset. the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value. fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. we recorded asset impairment charges of $3.8 million in the year ended december 31, 2023 associated with the customer relationship intangible asset. there were no events or changes in circumstances that may indicate the carrying amount of remaining assets is not recoverable.
income taxes we record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. in estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

table of contents additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made.
we operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. we follow accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is "more likely than not" to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments, and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.

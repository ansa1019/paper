the company's net sales decreased 1% in 2023 as compared to 2022 and increased 7% in 2022 as compared to 2021. the company's sales in 2023 were negatively impacted by a 22% reduction of sales in china due to lower customer demand for our products. the sales growth in 2022 was driven by strong customer demand across most major geographies, end markets and product categories. excluding china, the company's sales growth increased 5% and 6% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. foreign currency translation decreased sales growth by 1% and 5% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the wyatt acquisition increased sales growth by 3% in 2023.
instrument system sales decreased 7% in 2023 as compared to 2022 and increased 11% in 2022 as compared to 2021. in 2023, the decrease in instrument system sales resulted from weaker customer demand in china, which was partially offset by sales growth in the u.s. and europe. excluding china, the company's instrument system sales grew 1%. in addition, wyatt's instrument system sales added 4% to the company's instrument system sales growth. in 2022, the increase was driven by the broad-based increase in customer demand across all existing and newly introduced lc, lc-ms, and thermal analysis instrument system sales. foreign currency translation decreased instrument system sales growth by 1% and 5% in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 6% and 3% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. recurring revenues were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation in 2023 and 2022, which decreased sales by 1% and 6%, respectively.
operating income was $818 million in 2023, a decrease of 6% as compared to 2022. this decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher salary expenses related to merit compensation, $26 million in severance-related costs associated with a workforce reduction and costs related to the wyatt acquisition, including $13 million in due diligence costs, $27 million of intangible asset amortization and $19 million of costs associated with retention agreements. the negative effect of foreign currency translation lowered operating income by approximately $23 million during 2023.
in july 2023, the company made organizational changes to better align its resources with its growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction that impacted approximately 5% of the company's employees. the company incurred approximately $26 million of severance-related costs and paid approximately $19 million of severance-related costs in 2023, with the remaining costs to be paid in the first half of 2024. the company estimates that the savings from this reduction in workforce will be approximately $48 million on an annual basis.
operating income was $873 million in 2022, an increase of 6% as compared to 2021. this increase was primarily a result of the increase in sales volume and pricing increases, partially offset by higher electronic component and freight inflationary costs and the negative effect of foreign currency translation. the effect of foreign currency translation lowered operating income by approximately $71 million during 2022.
operating income as a percentage of sales was 27.7%, 29.4% and 29.5% in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
the company's effective tax rates were 12.8%, 15.5% and 14.1% for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. net income per diluted share was $10.84, $11.73 and $11.17 in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
the company generated $603 million, $612 million and $747 million of net cash flows provided by operating activities in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the decrease in 2023 operating cash flow was primarily a result of lower sales volumes, higher income tax payments and higher incentive compensation payments in 2023 as compared to 2022.
net cash used in investing activities included $1.3 billion for the wyatt acquisition in 2023 and capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $161 million, $176 million and
35
$161 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the cash flows used in investing activities in 2023, 2022 and 2021 included $16 million, $32 million, and $49 million, respectively, of capital expenditures related to the major expansion of the company's precision chemistry consumable operations in the united states.
during 2023, the company funded the wyatt acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. the company's outstanding debt on december 31, 2023 was $2.4 billion, a change of $0.8 billion from december 31, 2022, which resulted in the company's interest expense in 2023 increasing by $50 million to $99 million.
on march 3, 2023, the company entered into an agreement to amend the credit agreement governing its revolving credit facility (the "2023 amendment"). the 2023 amendment increases the borrowing capacity by $200 million to an aggregate total borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion.
in december 2023, the company's board of directors authorized the extension of the existing share repurchase program through january 21, 2025. the company's remaining authorization is $1.0 billion. during the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the company repurchased $58 million, $616 million and $640 million of the company's outstanding common stock, respectively, under the share repurchase programs. while the company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions, given current cash levels and debt borrowing capacity, it has temporarily suspended its share repurchases due to its acquisition of wyatt in the second quarter of 2023.

in 2023, sales decreased 1% as compared to 2022, primarily as a result of a 22% decrease in china sales during 2023, which was partially offset by broad-based sales growth across most other major regions. the decline in china sales was primarily driven by lower demand for our instrument systems and chemistry products resulting from increased government regulations and lower spending by our customers due to weak economic conditions in china. excluding china, the company's sales increased 5% and 6% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. foreign currency translation decreased sales growth by 1% and 5% in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
in 2023, sales increased 5% in the u.s. and 7% in europe, while decreasing 11% in asia, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing sales growth in europe by 2% and decreasing sales growth in asia by 4%,

which includes a 9% decrease in sales in japan resulting from foreign currency translation. wyatt's sales contributed 5% and 3% of sales growth to the u.s. and europe in 2023, respectively.
the sales growth in 2022 was broad-based across most major regions. foreign currency translation decreased total sales growth by 5% in 2022 as the u.s. dollar strengthened significantly against all other major currencies. the geographies that were the most negatively impacted by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar in 2022 were europe and japan, as the weakening of the euro and japanese yen lowered sales growth in europe and japan by 10% and 17%, respectively. china sales increased 8% in 2022, with foreign currency translation decreasing china sales growth by 2% in 2022. this increase in china sales was driven by strong customer demand for our products and services despite the negative impact that the covid-19 pandemic had on our business in china in 2022.

in 2023, sales to pharmaceutical customers decreased 3%, primarily driven by weakness in customer demand in china, with foreign currency translation decreasing pharmaceutical sales growth by 1% and wyatt contributing 3% to the company's pharmaceutical sales growth. combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, were flat in 2023, with foreign currency translation decreasing industrial sales growth by 1% and wyatt contributing 1% to industrial sales growth. combined sales to academic and government customers increased 13% in 2023, with foreign currency translation decreasing academic and government sales growth by 1% and wyatt contributing 4% to academic and government sales growth. sales to our academic and government customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales can vary significantly from period to period.
in 2022, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 5%, driven by strong growth in most major regions, partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation which decreased pharmaceutical sales by 5%. combined sales to industrial customers increased 10%, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 5%. combined sales to academic and government customers increased 7%, with foreign currency translation decreasing academic and government sales growth by 6%.

ta instrument system and service sales increased 3% and 10% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. foreign currency translation had minimal impact on sales growth in 2023 and decreased sales growth by 6% in 2022. in
38
2023, sales growth was broad-based across most major geographies, partially offset by weakness in china and the rest of asia. these increases were primarily driven by strong customer demand for our thermal analysis instruments and services.
cost of sales cost of sales decreased 4% in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily due to the change in sales mix and the lower material and freight costs. in 2022, cost of sales increased 8% as compared to 2021, primarily due to the increase in sales volumes during the year as well as an increase in electronic component and freight inflationary costs.
cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. at current foreign currency exchange rates, the company expects foreign currency translation to be neutral to gross profit during 2024.
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased 12% and 5% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase in 2023 is primarily driven by severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce, which increased expenses by 4%; the wyatt acquisition due diligence and integration costs, which increased expenses by 2%; and the wyatt acquisition-related retention expense, which increased expenses by 3%. these increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. the increase in selling and administrative expenses in 2022 as compared to 2021 can be attributed to higher salary merit and variable incentive compensation costs due to an increase in the number of employees. the effect of foreign currency translation had minimal impact on selling and administrative expenses in 2023 and decreased expenses by 4% in 2022.
as a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 24.9%, 22.1% and 22.5% for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased 1% and increased 5% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the decrease in research and development expenses in 2023 can be attributed to increases from merit compensation and costs associated with new products and the development of new technology initiatives, being offset by lower incentive compensation costs. the impact of foreign currency exchange decreased expenses by 1% and 3% in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
purchased intangibles amortization the increase in purchased intangible amortization of $26 million in 2023 can be attributed to the wyatt acquisition intangible assets.
acquired in-process research & development in 2022, the company completed an asset acquisition in which the cdms technology assets of megadalton were acquired for approximately $10 million in total purchase price, of which $5 million was paid at closing and the remaining $4 million will be paid in the future at various dates through 2029.
other (expense) income, net in 2022, the company sold equity an equity investment for $10 million in cash and recorded a gain on the sale of approximately $7 million in other income, net on the statement of operations. the company also incurred $6 million in losses on an equity investment within other income, net on the statement of operations.
in 2021, the company executed a settlement agreement to resolve patent infringement litigation with bruker corporation and bruker daltronik gmbh regarding their timstof product line. in connection with the
39
settlement, the company is entitled to receive $10 million in guaranteed payments, including minimum royalty payments. in 2021, the company recorded an unrealized gain of $10 million due to an observable change in the fair value of an existing investment that the company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over.
interest expense, net net interest expense in 2023 increased $44 million as compared to 2022 due to the additional borrowings by the company to fund the wyatt acquisition in 2023. net interest expense in 2022 increased $5 million as compared to 2021 due to the lower interest income benefit from the lower notional amount of interest rate cross currency swap agreements.
provision for income taxes the four principal jurisdictions in which the company manufactures are the u.s., ireland, the u.k. and singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 25% and 17%, respectively, as of december 31, 2023. the company has a new development and expansion incentive in singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period april 1, 2021 through march 31, 2026. prior to april 1, 2021, the company had a tax exemption on income arising from qualifying activities in singapore based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the company met as of december 31, 2020 and maintained through march 2021. the effect of applying the concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income arising from qualifying activities in singapore increased the company's net income by $16 million, $20 million and $20 million, and increased the company's net income per diluted share by $0.27, $0.33 and $0.32 for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
the company's effective tax rate for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was 12.8%, 15.5% and 14.1%, respectively.
the 2023 effective tax rate differed from the 21% u.s. statutory tax rate primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, an $18 million recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit as a result of the completion of a tax examination, a $15 million provision related to the global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") tax and a tax benefit of $3 million on stock-based compensation.
the 2022 effective tax rate differed from the 21% u.s. statutory tax rate primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, an $18 million provision related to the gilti tax and a tax benefit of $7 million on stock-based compensation.
the 2021 effective tax rate differed from the u.s. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, a $10 million provision related to the gilti tax and a tax benefit of $7 million on stock-based compensation.
effective starting in 2024, various foreign jurisdictions are beginning to implement aspects of the guidance issued by the organization for economic co-operation and development related to the new pillar two system of global minimum tax rules. the company does not believe these changes in tax law will have a material impact on the company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows in 2024. the company continues to monitor the adoption of the pillar two rules in additional jurisdictions.

long-term software contract commitments. for contracts the company is committed to that are not cancelable without penalties. the company's contractual obligation with these vendors was approximately $22 million as of december 31, 2023.
wyatt retention agreements. in conjunction with the wyatt acquisition, the company entered into retention agreements with certain employees, in which the company agreed to pay a total of $40 million by the end of the second anniversary of the acquisition date provided the employees remain employed over that period of time.
management believes, as of the date of this report, that the company's financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months.
critical accounting policies and estimates summary the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company's financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the company's results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period. on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its policies and

estimates. the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. there are other items within the company's consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. the company generally enters into contracts that include a combination of products and services. revenue is allocated to distinct performance obligations and is recognized net of allowances for returns and discounts.
the company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time control of the product transfers to the customer. in substantially all of the company's arrangements, title of the product transfers at shipping point and, as a result, the company determined control transfers at the point of shipment. in more limited cases, there are destination-based shipping terms and, thus, control is deemed to transfer when the products arrive at the customer site.
generally, the company's contracts for products include a performance obligation related to installation. the company has determined that the installation represents a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized separately upon the completion of installation. the company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the installation service based on the standalone selling price of the product and the service, which requires judgment. the company determines the relative standalone selling price of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours. in developing these estimates, the company considers past history, competition, billing rates of current services and other factors.
the company has sales from standalone software, which are included in product revenue. these arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which the company has determined are distinct performance obligations. the company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. the revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the company's performance in satisfying this obligation. unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis.
service revenue includes (i) service and software maintenance contracts and (ii) service calls (time and materials). instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. the amount of the service and software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the maintenance service period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the company's performance in satisfying this obligation. there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed.
the company's deferred revenue liabilities at december 31, 2023 of $324 million on the consolidated balance sheets consist of instrument service contract obligations and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. the company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts, where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period.

loss provision on inventory the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis ("fifo"). the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future demand, including in the company's current backlog of orders, and industry and market conditions. if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. the company's inventory balance at december 31, 2023 was recorded at its net realizable value of $516 million, which is net of write-downs of $41 million.
long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or on an interim basis when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows, including forecasted revenue growth and the discount rate to determine the fair value of these assets. if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined.
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment or one level below an operating segment. we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary before performing the quantitative assessment. if as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will be required. otherwise, no further testing will be required. if a quantitative impairment test is performed, we compare the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. estimating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant judgment by management. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. the company performs an annual goodwill impairment assessment for its reporting units as of december 31 each year. the company has two reporting units: waters and ta. goodwill is allocated to the reporting units at the time of acquisition.
the company's intangible assets include purchased technology; capitalized software; costs associated with acquiring company patents, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as licenses; and acquired ipr&d. purchased intangibles are recorded at their fair market values as of the acquisition date and amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to fifteen years. other intangibles are amortized over a period ranging from one to ten years. acquired ipr&d is amortized from the date of completion of the acquired program over its estimated useful life.
goodwill totaled $1.3 billion and $430 million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. net intangible assets and long-lived assets amounted to $629 million and $639 million, as of december 31, 2023, respectively, and $227 million and $582 million as of december 31, 2022, respectively.
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. this process involves the company estimating its income taxes, taking into account the amount, timing and character of taxable income, tax deductions and credits and assessing changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties. differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. in the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods, such changes could materially impact the company's financial position and results of operations.

the company continually evaluates the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods.
uncertain tax positions the company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those positions for the time value of money. the company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. at december 31, 2023, the company had unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, of $14 million, which represents a decrease of $15 million resulting, primarily, from the completion of a tax examination in 2023. this decrease reduced the income tax expense in the statement of operations and did not impact cash flows.
the company has a new development and expansion incentive in singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period april 1, 2021 through march 31, 2026. this new incentive has similar requirements for business spending targets, attaining and sustaining employment targets and performance of certain research and manufacturing activities as previous agreements. prior to april 1, 2021, the company had a tax exemption on income arising from qualifying activities in singapore, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the company met as of december 31, 2020 and maintained through march 2021. these milestones include the following types of objectives: reaching and maintaining annual revenue and business spending targets; meeting capital expenditures targets; attaining and sustaining employment targets; and establishing a local research and development and service center. the company determined that it was more likely than not to realize the tax exemption in singapore and, accordingly, did not recognize any reserves for unrecognized tax benefits on its balance sheet related to this exemption. in the event that any of the milestone targets were not met, the company would not be entitled to the tax exemption on income earned in singapore and all the tax benefits previously recognized would be reversed, resulting in the recognition of income tax expense equal to the statutory tax of 17% on income earned during that period.
the effect of applying these concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income arising from qualifying activities in singapore increased the company's net income by $16 million, $20 million and $20 million and increased the company's net income per diluted share by $0.27, $0.33 and $0.32 for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
business combinations and asset acquisitions we use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. the determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represents a significant portion of the purchase price in our recent acquisition of wyatt, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques, such as the income, cost and market approaches, as appropriate, in establishing the fair value of intangible assets. typically, key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets.
in our recent acquisition of wyatt, customer relationship intangible assets have been the most significant identifiable assets acquired. the customer relationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. our cash flow projections for the customer relationships acquired included significant judgments and assumptions related to customer attrition rate, discount rate, and forecasted revenues. the value of the client relationships acquired was $331 million in fiscal year 2023, the majority of which relates to us customer relationships.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report. the following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed under the headings "risk factors" and "forward-looking statements."
overview our mission is to improve the lives of people with diabetes. we are primarily engaged in the development, manufacture, and sale of our proprietary continuous insulin delivery system for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. the omnipod platform, includes: classic omnipod, its next generation omnipod dash, the most recent generation omnipod 5, and our latest innovation, omnipod go, which received u.s. food and drug administration ("fda") clearance in 2023, all of which eliminate the need for multiple daily injections using syringes or insulin pens or the use of pump and tubing. omnipod dash features a secure bluetooth enabled pod that is controlled by a smartphone-like pdm with a color touch screen user interface. omnipod 5, which builds on our omnipod dash mobile platform, is a tubeless automated insulin delivery system that integrates with a continuous glucose monitor ("cgm") to manage blood sugar and is fully controlled by a compatible personal smartphone or omnipod 5 controller. the cgm is sold separately by a third party. omnipod go, for which we are currently conducting a pilot program in the united states, is our basal-only pod for individuals with type 2 diabetes age 18 and older who require insulin.
our long-term financial objective is to sustain profitable growth. to achieve this goal, we launched omnipod 5 in the united states in august 2022 and in the united kingdom and germany in june and august 2023, respectively. subsequent to the launch of omnipod 5, we began to phase-out our classic omnipod in the u.s. in 2023, since the vast majority of our u.s. customer base is no longer using this product.
we are working on further building our international teams and advancing our regulatory, reimbursement, and market development efforts so we can bring omnipod 5 to additional international markets. we plan to launch omnipod 5 in more european markets in 2024 starting with the netherlands. additionally, in december 2023, we completed enrollment for our pivotal trial for omnipod 5 with the goal of expanding omnipod 5's indication to type 2 users. we expect to complete the trial and submit to the fda for an expanded indication by the end of 2024.
we have completed a randomized control trial in the u.s. and france for omnipod 5 with dexcom's g6 continuous glucose monitor ("cgm") to support our pricing and market access initiatives. we also continue to expand market access and awareness of omnipod products through our direct to consumer advertising programs and through growing our presence in the u.s. pharmacy channel, where access to omnipod 5 and omnipod dash is simpler and affordable, as no up-front investment is required.
we also continue to take steps to strengthen our global manufacturing capabilities. we recently completed construction of a new manufacturing plant in malaysia to support our international expansion strategy, further ensure product supply, and drive higher gross margins over time. we expect to begin production at this new manufacturing facility in 2024.
finally, we continue to focus on our product development efforts, including aid offerings such as choice of smartphone integration and cgm, and enhancing the customer experience through digital product and data capabilities. in february 2024, we began our limited market release of omnipod 5 with dexcom's g7 cgm in the united states and received ce mark approval for the added compatibility of libre 2 plus with omnipod 5 for individuals aged two years and older with type 1 diabetes. we expect to launch a limited market release of omnipod 5 with libre 2 plus in the u.k. and the netherlands in 2024. additionally, we received fda clearance for the omnipod 5 app for iphone in the fourth quarter of 2023 and plan to launch a limited market release in the u.s. in 2024.
results of operations the discussion of our results of operations for 2021 has been omitted from this form 10-k but can be found in item 7. management's discussion and analysis and results of operations in our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022 filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 24, 2023.
factors affecting operating results our pod is intended to be used continuously for up to three days, after which it is replaced with a new disposable pod. we recently achieved a milestone of approximately 425,000 estimated active global customers using omnipod products, including approximately 250,000 global customers using omnipod 5. our product's unique patented design allows us to provide pod therapy at a relatively low or no up-front investment in regions where reimbursement allows for it and our pay-as-you-go table of contents pricing model reduces the risk to third-party payors. as we grow our customer base, we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenues through recurring sales of our disposable pods, which provide recurring revenue.
in 2022, we issued two voluntary medical device corrections ("mdcs"), one in october for our omnipod dash pdm related to its battery and the other in november for our omnipod 5 controller related to its charging port and cable. during 2022, we initially recorded a net charge of $57.9 million related to these mdcs. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recorded $11.5 million of income associated with a change in our estimated liability for the mdcs, primarily due to lower distribution costs.
we continue to experience challenges stemming from the global supply chain disruption; however, while there is no guarantee of future performance, to date we have been able to successfully mitigate this disruption and ensure uninterrupted supply to our customers by increasing our inventory levels and taking other measures. while our mitigation efforts and inflation have and are expected to continue to negatively impact gross margins and net income in 2024, we intend to continue to work to improve productivity to help offset these costs.

(1) constant currency revenue growth is a non-gaap financial measure which should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with gaap. see "management's use of non-gaap measures."
total revenue for 2023 increased $391.8 million, or 30.0%, to $1,697.1 million, compared with $1,305.3 million in 2022. constant currency revenue growth of 29.6% was primarily driven by higher volume and, to a lesser extent, favorable sales channel mix, partially offset by decreased drug delivery revenue.
u.s.
revenue from the sale of omnipod products in the u.s. increased $366.2 million, or 41.4%, in 2023 to $1,251.0 million, compared with $884.8 million in 2022. this increase primarily resulted from higher volumes driven by growing our customer base and, to a lesser extent, growth through the pharmacy channel, where pods have a higher average selling price due in part to the fact that we offer the pdm/controller for no charge, and an increase in estimated inventory days-on-hand at distributors.
revenue from the sale of omnipod products in the u.s. includes $473.7 million of related party revenue in 2023, compared with $249.9 million in 2022. the $223.8 million increase primarily resulted from growth through the pharmacy channel. additional information regarding our related party transactions is provided in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
in 2024, we expect strong u.s. revenue growth driven by continued volume growth of omnipod 5, continued sales of omnipod dash, and the benefits of our recurring revenue model and pharmacy channel access. we expect these increases to be partially offset by lower conversions from classic omnipod and omnipod dash to omnipod 5 in the first half of the year compared to 2023 since the vast majority of conversions to omnipod 5 occurred in 2023.
international revenue from the sale of omnipod products in our international markets increased $47.1 million, or 13.0%, in 2023 to $410.1 million, compared with $363.0 million in 2022. excluding the 1.6% favorable impact of currency exchange, the remaining 11.4% increase in revenue was primarily due to higher volumes as we continue to expand awareness and access to omnipod dash and, to a lesser extent, the timing of revenue recognition related to deferrals associated with our omnipod dash mdc and a technology upgrade program, and product mix from the launch of omnipod 5 in the united kingdom. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in estimated days-on-hand at distributors and higher attrition in the countries where we have not yet launched omnipod 5 as we continue to be impacted by competition from aid systems.
in 2024, we expect higher international revenue due to continued volume growth driven by new customers and conversions to omnipod 5 in the u.k. and germany and to a lesser extent, the ongoing adoption of omnipod dash. we expect these increases to be partially offset by competition from aid systems.
table of contents drug delivery substantially all of our drug delivery revenue consists of sales of pods to amgen for use in the neulasta® onpro® kit, a delivery system for amgen's neulasta to help reduce the risk of infection after intense chemotherapy. drug delivery revenue for 2023 decreased $21.5 million, or 37.4%, to $36.0 million, compared with $57.5 million in 2022. this decrease primarily resulted from a lower forecast from our partner, partially offset by a higher selling price. in 2024, we expect drug delivery revenue to decline $18 million to $22 million due to a lower forecast from our partner.

cost of revenue cost of revenue for 2023 increased $37.5 million, or 7.5%, to $537.2 million, compared with $499.7 million in 2022. gross margin was 68.3% in 2023, compared with 61.7% in 2022. the 6.6 point increase in gross margin was primarily driven by the $57.9 million net charge associated with the voluntary mdc notices issued in 2022, which did not repeat in the current period, and an $11.5 million revision to the voluntary mdc liability in 2023, due to lower than expected distribution costs. the increase was also driven by higher average selling prices primarily due to growth in the pharmacy channel and improved manufacturing efficiencies. these increases were partially offset by higher production costs associated with omnipod 5 and u.s. manufacturing as it continues to become a larger portion of total production, and to a lesser extent, continued inflation.
we expect gross margin for 2024 to be in the range of 68% to 69%. we anticipate gross margin to be relatively level due to higher average selling prices primarily due to growth in the pharmacy channel and improved manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by $11.5 million of income associated with a reduction to our mdc liability in 2023, which will not recur, and higher costs associated with our new product launches.
research and development research and development expenses for 2023 increased $24.8 million, or 13.8%, to $205.0 million, compared with $180.2 million in 2022. this increase was primarily due to year-over-year headcount additions to support our continued investment in the development of omnipod products and third-party costs to support clinical trials. research and development expenses as a percent of revenue declined to 12.1% in 2023, compared with 13.8% in 2022 primarily due to an increase in sustaining costs following the launch of omnipod 5 in the united states, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. we expect research and development spending in 2024 to increase compared with 2023 as we continue to invest in advancing our innovation and clinical pipeline.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses for 2023 increased $147.1 million, or 25.0%, to $734.9 million, compared with $587.8 million in 2022. this increase was primarily attributable to year-over-year headcount additions, mainly to support international growth and costs associated with our new leadership structure that is designed to accelerate innovation and commercialization. in addition, we had higher direct-to-consumer advertising spend and third-party customer service costs to support omnipod 5 adoption, and an increase in software license fees driven by investments in new systems due to our growing business and increased headcount. to a lesser extent, the increase was due to higher amortization of cloud computing implementation costs and higher third-party training costs. these increases were partially offset by $27.3 million of legal costs incurred in the prior year related to the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit, associated legal fees, and an estimated liability to settle a contract dispute.
we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2024 compared with 2023 due to investments in our operating structure, primarily headcount additions, to facilitate continued growth, including customer support. additionally, we plan to make additional investments to support our omnipod platform, including market acceptance and access, and the phased launch of omnipod 5 in our international markets.
table of contents non-operating items interest expense and income interest expense of $36.2 million in 2023 was level with interest expense of $36.0 million in 2022. interest income for 2023 increased $19.3 million to $28.6 million, compared with $9.3 million in 2022. this increase was primarily driven by higher interest rates.
other income (expense), net other income of $2.2 million for 2023 consists primarily of $2.6 million of gains related to fair value adjustments associated with our strategic debt and equity investments. other expense of $1.1 million for 2022 consists primarily of net unrealized and realized foreign currency losses.
income tax expense income tax expense was $8.3 million on pre-tax income of $214.6 million for 2023 and $5.2 million on pre-tax income of $9.8 million for 2022. our effective tax rate was 3.9% and 53.4% for 2023 and 2022, respectively. the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax income in the u.s. where we have net operating loss carryforwards to reduce taxable profits and a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. accordingly, we have not reported any tax benefit relating to the remaining net operating loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards that are available for utilization in future periods.
we maintain a $202.9 million valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets at december 31, 2023. given our current earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that within the next 12 months, sufficient positive evidence may become available to allow us to reach a conclusion that a significant portion of our valuation allowance will no longer be needed. a release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense in the period the release is recorded. however, the timing and amount of the valuation allowance release, if any, are unknown as this is subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve in future periods and other evidence that will be considered at the time of the assessment. refer to note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our income tax expense.
in 2021, the organization for economic co-operation and development ("oecd") and g20 international forum released the model global anti-base erosion (globe) rules ("model rules") under pillar two. these model rules set forth the common approach for a global minimum tax at 15% for multinational enterprises with revenue greater than €750 million and is expected to be applicable to insulet. in december 2022, pillar two was adopted by the council of the european union for implementation by european union member states by december 31, 2023, with effect for tax years beginning in calendar year 2024. similar directives under pillar two are already adopted or expected to be adopted by taxing authorities in other countries where insulet has business operations, with widespread implementation of the global minimum tax in calendar years 2024 and 2025. we are continuing to evaluate the model rules for pillar two and related legislation, and their potential impact on future periods.

non-gaap financial measures management uses the following non-gaap financial measures:
constant currency revenue growth represents the change in revenue between current and prior year periods using the exchange rate in effect during the applicable prior year period. we present constant currency revenue growth because we believe it provides meaningful information regarding our results on a consistent and comparable basis. management uses this non-gaap financial measure, in addition to financial measures in accordance with gaap, to evaluate our operating results. it is also one of the performance metrics that determines management incentive compensation.
adjusted ebitda represents net income plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and other significant transactions or events, such as legal settlements, medical device corrections, gains (losses) on investments, and loss on extinguishment of debt, which affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performances, as applicable. we present adjusted ebitda because management uses it as a supplemental measure in assessing our operating performance, and we believe that it is helpful to investors, and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period. adjusted ebitda is a commonly used measure in determining business value and we use it internally to report results.
these non-gaap financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, the above definitions may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. non-gaap financial measures exclude the effect of items that increase or decrease our reported results of operations; accordingly, we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety.

in connection with the issuance of the 0.375% convertible senior notes ("0.375% notes"), we purchased capped call options ("capped calls") on our common stock. by entering into the capped calls, we expect to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock (or, in the event the conversion is settled in cash, to provide a source of cash to settle a portion of our cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion our stock price exceeds the conversion price under the 0.375% notes. the capped calls have an initial strike price of $335.90 per share and cover 3.5 million shares of our common stock.
credit agreement we have a $300 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility"), which expires in 2028. at december 31, 2023, no amount was outstanding under the revolving credit facility. the revolving credit facility contains a covenant to maintain a specified leverage ratio under certain conditions when there are amounts outstanding under the facility. it also contains other customary covenants, none of which are considered restrictive to our operations. additionally, we have a seven year term loan, which matures in 2028, that contains covenants restricting or limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make asset dispositions, create or permit liens, sell, transfer or exchange assets, guarantee certain indebtedness, and make acquisitions and other investments.
additional information regarding our debt is provided in notes 16 and 26 to the consolidated financial statements.
we believe that our current liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected operating, investing, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months.

table of contents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of $145.7 million in 2023 was primarily attributable to net income, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense, which was more than offset by a $190.6 million working capital cash outflow. the working capital outflow was driven by a $154.2 million increase in accounts receivable, a $53.6 million increase in inventories and a $42.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by a $70.3 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in sales in the u.s. pharmacy channel, which has longer payment terms. the increase in inventories was primarily driven by a planned inventory build to mitigate supply chain risk and satisfy demand. the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was driven by an increase in prepaid cloud computing implementation and upgrade costs, subscription renewal costs, and other receivables. finally, the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in accrued rebates mainly due to revenue growth in the pharmacy channel and an increase in compensation costs due to higher incentive compensation achievement and headcount additions, partially offset by warranty fulfillment associated with the voluntary mdcs issued in 2022.
net cash provided by operating activities of $119.0 million in 2022 was primarily attributable to net income, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a $2.5 million working capital cash outflow. the working capital outflow was driven by a $36.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, a $51.8 million increase in accounts receivable, and a $49.1 million increase in inventories, partially offset by a $137.6 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily driven by an increase in cloud computing implementation costs. the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in sales in the u.s. pharmacy channel, which has longer payment terms, partially offset by a decrease in unbilled accounts receivable related to lower production volumes of our drug delivery product. the increase in inventories was primarily driven by a planned inventory build to satisfy demand. finally, the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily driven by the voluntary mdcs issued for our omnipod dash pdms and omnipod 5 controllers, an increase in rebates due to growth in the pharmacy channel and an increase in compensation costs due to higher incentive compensation achievement and head count additions.

off-balance sheet arrangements in 2022, the company entered into a $20 million uncommitted letter of credit facility, and concurrently with the execution of an agreement to acquire real estate in malaysia, a letter of credit of $16.5 million was issued under the facility to backstop a bank guarantee for the same amount. the bank guarantee serves as security for the building until the company purchases the property. in 2023, additional letters of credit totaling $3.5 million were issued under this facility. in aggregate, we had letters of credit totaling $20.9 million and $18.6 million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. additional information regarding our letters of credit is provided in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. the following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of the promised products in an amount that reflects the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled. we sell products both through distributors, who resell the products to consumers, and directly to consumers. transaction price is typically based on contracted rates less any estimates of claim denials and historical reimbursement experience, guidelines and payor mix, and less estimated variable consideration adjustments, including rebates. recognizing revenue requires us to exercise judgment and use estimates that can have a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue we report. we exercise significant judgment when we determine variable consideration adjustments. the amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is included in revenue only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. we estimate reductions to our revenues for rebates paid to distributors in the united states and canada and pharmacy benefit managers ("pbm") in the united states. rebates are based on contractual arrangements, which may vary. our estimates are based on products sold, historical experience, trends, specific known market events and, as available, channel inventory data. rebates charged against gross sales amounted to $465.5 million, $247.1 million and $143.3 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. provisions for rebates, sales discounts, and returns are accounted for as a reduction of sales when revenue is recognized and are included within accounts receivable trade or accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, based upon the recipient of the rebate. if the actual amounts of consideration that we receive differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates, which affects reported revenue in the period that such variances become known.
table of contents our drug delivery product line includes sales of a modified version of the pod to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who use our technology as a delivery method for their drugs. revenue from the drug delivery product was $36.0 million for 2023. revenue for this product line is recognized as the product is produced. accounting for drug delivery revenue requires us to select a method to measure progress towards the satisfaction of the performance obligation. this election of the most meaningful measure of progress by which to recognize drug delivery revenue requires the application of judgment. we elected the input method and selected a blend of cost and time to produce as the measure of progress. accordingly, revenue is recognized over time using a blend of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion and time incurred to date relative to total production time to measure progress toward the satisfaction of our performance obligations. we believe that both incurred cost and elapsed time reflect the value generated, which best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. contract costs include third-party costs as well as an allocation of manufacturing overhead. changes from quarter to quarter in quantity and stage of production of in-process inventory could have a significant quarterly impact on revenue.
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
significant judgement is required in determining whether it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which a deferred tax asset can be utilized. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including cumulative income in recent fiscal years, our forecast of future taxable income exclusive of certain reversing temporary differences and significant risks and uncertainties related to our business. in determining future taxable income, we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state, federal and international pre-tax operating income, the reversal of certain temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income in applicable tax jurisdictions, which are based on our commercial experience to date and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage our underlying business.
as of december 31, 2023, we recorded a full valuation allowance of $202.9 million on our net deferred tax assets because realizability is not more likely than not. if we determine that the deferred tax assets are realizable in a future period, it would result in material changes to income tax expense in that period.
product warranty we provide a four-year warranty on our pdms and controllers sold in the united states and europe and a five-year warranty on pdms sold in canada. in addition, we may replace pods that do not function in accordance with product specifications. we estimate our warranty obligation at the time the product is shipped based on historical experience and the estimated cost to service the claims, which include the current product cost, reclaim costs, shipping and handling costs and direct and incremental distribution and customer service support costs. since we continue to introduce new products and versions, the anticipated performance of the product over the warranty period is also considered in estimating warranty reserves. changes to the actual replacement rates, which are evaluated quarterly, could have a material impact on our estimated warranty reserve.
inventory reserves we reduce the carrying value of inventories for items that are potentially excess, obsolete, or slow-moving based on changes in customer demand, technology developments, or other economic factors in order to state inventories at net realizable value. factors influencing these adjustments include inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. during 2023, we charged $3.7 million to the consolidated statement of operations for excess and obsolete inventory. the determination of this charge involved assumptions regarding the number of pdms expected to be utilized to satisfy warranty claims during the phase-out period and the length of time we will continue to offer classic omnipod outside the united states.

overview business ebay inc. is a global commerce leader that connects people and builds communities to create economic opportunity for all. our technology empowers millions of buyers and sellers in more than 190 markets around the world, providing everyone the opportunity to grow and thrive. our marketplace platforms, including our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com and its localized counterparts, our off-platform businesses in japan and the united states, and our suite of mobile apps, together, create one of the world's largest and most vibrant marketplaces for discovering great value and unique selection.
throughout most of 2023, we experienced reduced traffic in most markets resulting from geopolitical events, inflationary pressure, foreign exchange rate volatility, elevated interest rates and lower consumer confidence. these factors negatively impacted discretionary consumer spending, are uncertain in duration and we expect them to continue into 2024.
presentation in addition to the corresponding measures under generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), management uses non-gaap measures in reviewing our financial results. the foreign exchange neutral ("fx-neutral"), or constant currency, net revenue amounts discussed below are non-gaap financial measures and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with gaap. accordingly, the fx-neutral information appearing in the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information provided below in "non-gaap measures of financial performance," which includes reconciliations of fx-neutral financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures. we calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates, excluding hedging activity, applied to current year transactional currency amounts.
table of contents fiscal year highlights net revenues increased 3% to $10.1 billion during 2023 compared to $9.8 billion in 2022. fx-neutral net revenues (as defined above) increased 4% compared to 2022. operating margin decreased to 19.2% in 2023 compared to 24.0% in 2022.
we generated cash flow from continuing operating activities of $2.4 billion in 2023 compared to $2.6 billion in 2022.
we recorded $1.8 billion of aggregate gains on equity investments and warrant in our consolidated statement of income during 2023 compared to $3.8 billion of aggregate losses recorded during 2022.
in 2023, we repurchased $1.4 billion of common stock and paid $528 million in cash dividends.
in 2023, we repaid debt of $1.2 billion consisting of the floating rate and 2.750% senior notes due 2023.
in 2023, we announced our support for the voluntary tender offer led by permira and blackstone to acquire all the publicly traded shares of adevinta (the "adevinta transaction"). as part of the adevinta transaction, ebay agreed to sell 50% of its shares for an estimated $2.2 billion and to exchange the remaining shares for an equity stake of approximately 20% in the newly privatized company. the adevinta transaction remains subject to closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2024.
in february 2024, our board authorized an additional $2.0 billion stock repurchase program with no expiration from the date of authorization.
in february 2024, we declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of 2024 of $0.27 per share of common stock to be paid on march 25, 2024 to stockholders of record as of march 11, 2024.
table of contents results of operations we have one reportable segment to reflect the way management and our chief operating decision maker ("codm") review and assess performance of the business. our reportable segment is marketplace, which includes our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the ebay suite of mobile apps. the accounting policies of our segment are the same as those described in "note 1 - the company and summary of significant accounting policies" in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
net revenues net revenues primarily include final value fees, feature fees, fees to promote listings, payment service fees, listing fees, and store subscription fees from sellers on our platforms. our net revenues also include revenues from the sale of advertisements, revenue sharing arrangements and shipping fees. our net revenues are reduced by incentives, including discounts, coupons and rewards, provided to our customers.

seasonality we expect transaction activity patterns on our platforms to trend with general consumer buying patterns and expect that these trends will continue. seasonal trends in net revenues may be influenced as we introduce and scale new products throughout the year. in addition, macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of covid-19, have in the past disrupted seasonal patterns in net revenues, particularly in the first quarter of 2021. the following table presents our total net revenues and the sequential quarterly movements of these net revenues for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):

(1)net revenues were net of $56 million and $140 million of hedging gains and $65 million of hedging losses during the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
(2)foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar had a favorable impact of $52 million, an unfavorable impact of $320 million and a favorable impact of $188 million during the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily attributable to the weakening of the u.s. dollar against the british pound and other major currencies.
our commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the british pound and euro. year-over-year appreciation or depreciation of the u.s. dollar may have a material impact to our financial results, and we have seen and could continue to see elevated foreign currency volatility in the future. through our hedging programs, we actively monitor foreign currency volatility and attempt to mitigate significant risk. as shown in the table above, we generate approximately half of our net revenues internationally. therefore, we are subject to the risks related to conducting business in foreign countries as discussed under "item 1a: risk factors" in part i of this report.
key operating metrics gross merchandise volume ("gmv") and take rate are significant factors that we believe affect our net revenues.
gmv consists of the total value of all paid transactions between users on our platforms during the applicable period inclusive of shipping fees and taxes. despite gmv's divergence from revenue, we still believe that gmv provides a useful measure of the overall volume of paid transactions that flow through our platforms in a given period.
take rate is defined as net revenues divided by gmv and represents net revenue as a percentage of overall volume on our platforms. we believe that take rate provides a useful measure of our ability to monetize volume through marketplace services on our platforms in a given period. we use take rate to identify key revenue drivers on our marketplace.

(3)take rate is defined as net revenues divided by gmv, as discussed above.
net revenues increased primarily due to the investment in focus categories and a higher take rate driven by the expansion of promoted listings and payment services and the launch of ebay international shipping. the increase in net revenues was partially offset by a reduction in traffic in most markets resulting from geopolitical events, inflationary pressure, foreign exchange rate volatility, elevated interest rates and lower consumer confidence, which negatively impacted discretionary consumer spending during 2023 compared to 2022.
net revenues continued to outpace gmv during 2023 primarily due to the benefit of a higher take rate. while we expect this trend to continue to a lesser extent into 2024, we still believe gmv provides a useful measure of overall volume of paid transactions that flow through the platform in a given period.
cost of net revenues cost of net revenues represents costs associated with customer support, site operations and payment processing. significant components of these costs primarily consist of employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment and amortization expense, bank transaction fees, credit card interchange and assessment fees, authentication costs, shipping costs and digital services tax. the following table presents cost of net revenues for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):

the increase in cost of net revenues during 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by a $96 million increase related to the launch of ebay international shipping, a $39 million increase related to the expansion of authentication services, and a $24 million increase in customer support costs, partially offset by a $17 million decrease in payment processing costs incurred.

**     not meaningful sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and marketing program costs (both online and offline), employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), certain user coupons and rewards, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. online marketing expenses represent traffic acquisition costs in various channels such as paid search, affiliates marketing and display advertising. offline advertising primarily includes brand campaigns and buyer/seller communications.
the increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a $91 million increase in employee related costs and a $13 million increase in advertising and marketing program costs (both online and offline), partially offset by a $26 million decrease in user coupons and rewards.
product development product development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. product development expenses are net of required capitalization of major platform and other product development efforts, including the development and maintenance of our technology platform. our top technology priorities include the implementation of our strategic plan including payment intermediation capabilities, improved seller tools and buyer experiences.
the increase in product development expenses during 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs as we continued to innovate and modernize the shopping experience across our platforms powered by intelligent computing at scale.
capitalized internal use and platform development costs were $115 million and $130 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. these costs are primarily reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment, legal expenses, restructuring, insurance premiums and professional fees. our legal expenses, including those related to various ongoing legal proceedings, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.
table of contents the increase in general and administrative expenses during 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to $141 million of restructuring costs that did not occur in 2022, an $84 million increase in employee related costs, and an incremental $18 million accrual for probable losses related to legal matters. for additional details related to our legal matters, please see "note 13 - commitments and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
provision for transaction losses provision for transaction losses primarily consists of transaction loss expense associated with our buyer protection programs, losses from our managed payments services, fraud and bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balance. we expect our provision for transaction losses to fluctuate depending on many factors, including changes to our protection programs and the impact of regulatory changes.
the increase in provision for transaction losses during 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to $17 million higher transaction loss expense related to the launch of ebay international shipping.
gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net primarily consists of gains and losses related to our various types of equity investments, including our equity investments in adevinta, kakaobank and gmarket, and gains and losses due to changes in fair value of the warrant received from adyen. the following table presents gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):

(1)gain (loss) on sale of shares in adevinta included: (i) in 2022, a $2 million gain on the change in fair value of shares sold; (ii) in 2021, an $88 million gain recognized on the sale of the shares offset by a $79 million loss on the change in fair value of the shares sold.
(2)gain (loss) on other investments primarily included: (i) in 2022, primarily downward adjustments of $13 million recorded on equity investments under the fair value option and $7 million recorded on equity investments without readily determinable fair values; (ii) in 2021, primarily a $41 million upward adjustment and a $10 million impairment recorded on equity investments without readily determinable fair values.
**     not meaningful the change in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net during 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by the change in the fair value of our equity investments in adevinta, gmarket and kakaobank and the warrant.

interest expense increased primarily due to higher rates offset by lower average notional on outstanding debt during 2023. in 2023, we repaid two tranches of senior notes at substantially lower interest rates than the senior notes that were issued during the fourth quarter of 2022. as a result, we expect continued upward pressure on interest expense into 2024.
interest income increased primarily due to higher yields on corporate debt and government and agency securities in a higher interest rate environment. we expect this trend to continue into 2024.

the increase in our effective tax rate for 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets related to a tax rate reduction and an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions partially offset by a benefit from the release of a valuation allowance.
we are regularly under examination by tax authorities both domestically and internationally. we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations, although there are inherent uncertainties in these examinations. due to the ongoing tax examinations, it is generally impractical to determine the amount and timing of these adjustments. however, we expect several tax examinations to close within the next twelve months. see "note 16 - income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on estimated settlements within the next twelve months.
table of contents non-gaap measures of financial performance to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we use fx-neutral net revenues, which are non-gaap financial measures. management uses the foregoing non-gaap measures in reviewing our financial results. we define fx-neutral net revenues as net revenues minus the exchange rate effect. we define exchange rate effect as the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts, excluding hedging activity.
these non-gaap measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. in addition, these non-gaap measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. non-gaap measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap. these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures.
these non-gaap measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future. specifically, we believe these non-gaap measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. in addition, because we have historically reported certain non-gaap results to investors, we believe that the inclusion of these non-gaap measures provide consistency in our financial reporting.

continuing operating activities our operating cash flows arise primarily from cash received from our customers on our platforms offset by cash payments for sales and marketing, employee compensation and payment processing expenses.
cash provided by continuing operating activities of $2.4 billion in 2023 compared to $2.6 billion in 2022 was primarily attributable to a $409 million decrease in operating income as well as working capital movements and changes in non-cash items.
continuing investing activities cash provided by continuing investing activities of $240 million in 2023 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $14.5 billion from the maturities and sales of investments, partially offset by cash paid for investments of $13.9 billion and property and equipment of $456 million.
cash provided by investing activities of $2.5 billion in 2022 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $20.6 billion from the maturities and sales of investments and proceeds of $1.1 billion in the aggregate from the sales of shares in adevinta, adyen and kakaobank, partially offset by cash paid for investments of $18.5 billion, property and equipment of $449 million and cash paid for the acquisition of tcgplayer of $208 million.
the largely offsetting effects of purchases of investments and maturities and sale of investments results from the management of our investments. as our immediate cash needs change, purchase and sale activity will fluctuate.
continuing financing activities cash used in continuing financing activities of $2.5 billion in 2023 was primarily driven by common stock repurchases of $1.4 billion, debt repayments of $1.2 billion related to the redemption of our floating rate and 2.750% senior notes due 2023, and $528 million of cash dividends paid, partially offset by net funds receivable and payable activity of $717 million driven by changes in payment processors.
cash used in financing activities of $3.8 billion in 2022 was primarily driven by common stock repurchases of $3.1 billion, debt repayments of $1.4 billion, which was comprised of $750 million related to our 3.800% senior fixed rate notes due 2022 and $605 million related to our 2.600% senior fixed rate notes due 2022, and $489 million of cash dividends paid, partially offset by proceeds from debt issuances of $1.2 billion.
the positive and negative effects of exchange rate movements on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were due to the weakening and strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other currencies, primarily the british pound and euro, during 2023 and 2022, respectively.
table of contents liquidity and capital resource requirements as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-term non-equity investments from continuing operations, in an aggregate amount of $5.1 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively. we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, borrowings available under our credit agreement and commercial paper program, and our access to capital markets, will be sufficient to satisfy our material cash requirements over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.
however, geopolitical events, inflationary pressure, foreign exchange volatility, elevated interest rates and global economic uncertainty have caused material disruptions in both u.s. and international financial markets and economies and are uncertain in duration. the impact of these events has increased, and may continue to increase, our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. the future impact of these events cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot assure that we will have access to external financing at times and on terms we consider acceptable, or at all, or that we will not experience other liquidity issues going forward.
we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. the following sections summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments.
senior notes in january 2023, we redeemed the $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of our floating rate and 2.750% senior notes due 2023. total cash consideration paid was $1.2 billion, as the redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount.
as of december 31, 2023, we had fixed-rate senior notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of $7.8 billion, with $750 million aggregate principal amount payable within 12 months. future interest payments associated with the senior notes totaled an aggregate of $2.4 billion, with an aggregate of $0.3 billion payable within 12 months. the net proceeds from the issuances of these senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, capital expenditures, share repurchases, repayment of indebtedness and acquisitions.
commercial paper we have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at maturity of up to $1.5 billion outstanding at any time with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. as of december 31, 2023, there were no commercial paper notes outstanding.
credit agreement in march 2020, we entered into a credit agreement that provided for an unsecured $2.0 billion five-year credit facility (the "prior credit agreement"). as of december 31, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under the prior credit agreement.
in january 2024, we terminated the prior credit agreement and entered into a new credit agreement (the "credit agreement") that provides for an unsecured $2.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility. we may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $1.0 billion. funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and will bear interest at either (i) a customary forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate published by cme group for the relevant interest period plus an adjustment of 0.1% or (ii) a customary base rate formula, plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from 0% to 0.375%. the covenants of the credit agreement are consistent with the covenants of the prior credit agreement.
table of contents leases we have operating leases for office space, data centers, as well as other corporate assets that we utilize under lease arrangements. as of december 31, 2023, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $638 million, with $136 million payable within 12 months. for additional details related to our leases, please see "note 12 - leases" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
purchase obligations purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, software applications, engineering development services, construction contracts) and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. as of december 31, 2023, we had purchase obligations of $100 million, with $30 million payable within 12 months.
income taxes we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $457 million included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2023. the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. however, given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.
as of december 31, 2023, our assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term non-equity investments from continuing operations included assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $1.9 billion. as we repatriate these funds to the united states, we will be required to pay income taxes in certain u.s. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs. we have accrued deferred taxes for the tax effect of repatriating the funds to the united states.
see "note 16 - income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on unrecognized tax benefits and deferred taxes.
stock repurchases our stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.
we expect, subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, to continue making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock. however, our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management's determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.
in february 2022 our board authorized an additional $4.0 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization. during 2023, we repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. as of december 31, 2023, a total of approximately $1.4 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. in february 2024, our board authorized an additional $2.0 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization. see "note 14 - stockholders' equity" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information about our stock repurchase programs.
dividends we paid a total of $528 million and $489 million in cash dividends in 2023 and 2022, respectively. in february 2024, we declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of 2024 of $0.27 per share of common stock to be paid on march 25, 2024 to stockholders of record as of march 11, 2024.
table of contents other capital resource requirements we actively monitor all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments, focusing primarily on the safety of principal and secondarily on improving yield on these assets. we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various counterparties in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these counterparties fail or encounter difficulties. to date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets, including, without limitation, as a result of the impact of geopolitical events, inflationary pressure and foreign exchange rate volatility. at any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and customer accounts that are deposited and invested with third party financial institutions.
we have entered into various indemnification agreements and, in the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we have commercial relations. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these various indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. to date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant, either individually or collectively. see "note 13 - commitments and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information about our indemnification provisions.
table of contents critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates general the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. our senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other disclosures included in this report.
revenue recognition we may enter into certain revenue contracts that include promises to transfer multiple goods or services, including discounts on future services. we also may enter into arrangements to purchase services from certain customers. as a result, significant interpretation and judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions, including: (1) whether services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct performance obligation; (3) whether revenue should be reported gross (as ebay is acting as a principal), or net (as ebay is acting as an agent); (4) evaluating whether a promotion or incentive is a payment to a customer; and (5) whether the arrangement would be characterized as revenue or reimbursement of costs incurred. changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition.
income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties and the complexity of taxes on foreign earnings. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. tax positions are evaluated for potential reserves for uncertainty based on the estimated probability of sustaining the position under examination. our income tax rate is affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings including u.s. minimum taxes on foreign earnings. the deferred tax benefit derived from the amortization of our intellectual property is based on the fair value, which has been agreed with foreign tax authorities. the deferred tax benefit may from time to time change based on changes in tax rates. management has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at the balance sheet date.
deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and long-range business forecasts. as of december 31, 2023, we had a valuation allowance on certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
table of contents we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states, or gaap, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. we recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. we adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service, as well as various state and foreign tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
based on our results for the year ended december 31, 2023, a one-percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately $37 million, resulting in an approximate $0.07 change in diluted earnings per share.
goodwill the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill.
as of december 31, 2023, our goodwill totaled $4.3 billion. we assess the impairment of goodwill of our reporting unit annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit's carrying value is compared to its fair value. the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using market and discounted cash flow approaches. goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. the discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. the market approach uses comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples to value our reporting unit. failure to achieve these expected results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of august 31, 2023 and 2022. as of december 31, 2023, we determined that no impairment of the carrying value of goodwill was required. see "note 5 - goodwill and intangible assets" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss, net of expected recoveries, and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statements of income. these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events.
table of contents from time to time, we are involved in disputes and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. we are currently involved in legal proceedings, some of which are discussed in "note 13 - commitments and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. however, even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could require significant amounts of management's time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims, we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business. any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
recent accounting pronouncements see "note 1 - the company and summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.

overview of fiscal year 2023
during fiscal year 2023, we delivered differentiated performance despite market headwinds, demonstrating the strength of our product portfolio, continued innovation, and investments in our people. our overall revenue in fiscal year 2023 decreased by $561.3 million, or 17%, as compared to fiscal year 2022, reflecting a decrease of $560.7 million, or 28%, in diagnostics segment revenue and a decrease of $0.6 million, or less than 1%, in life sciences segment revenue. the decrease in diagnostics segment revenue was primarily driven by decreased demand for covid-19 product offerings, partially offset by growth in the core immunodiagnostics business. the decrease in life sciences segment revenue was driven by a decrease in instruments revenue due to pharmaceutical and biotechnology market headwinds and a decrease in software revenue from the timing of contract renewals, partially offset by an increase in reagents revenue.
our consolidated gross margins decreased 411 basis points in fiscal year 2023, as compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to lower revenue from covid-19 product offerings, and an unfavorable shift in product mix, partially offset by pricing actions. our consolidated operating margin decreased 1,150 basis points in fiscal year 2023, as compared to fiscal year 2022, also due to lower revenue from covid-19 product offerings and unfavorable shift in product mix, partially offset by operating expense reductions.
overall, we believe that our range of product offerings, leading market positions, global scale and financial strength provides us with a foundation for continued long-term growth, margin expansion and robust cash flow generation.
consolidated results of operations fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022
revenue revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $2,750.6 million, as compared to $3,311.8 million for fiscal year 2022, a decrease of $561.3 million, or 17%. the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. diagnostics segment revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $1,459.1 million, as compared to $2,019.7 million for fiscal year 2022, a decrease of $560.7 million, or 28%, due to a decrease of $380.3 million in immunodiagnostics revenue, a decrease of $165.2 million in applied genomics revenue and a decrease of $15.3 million in reproductive health revenue. life sciences segment revenue was $1,292.3 million for fiscal year 2023, as compared to $1,292.9 million for fiscal year 2022, a decrease of $0.6 million, or less than 1%, driven by a decrease of $24.3 million in instruments revenue and a decrease of $17.7 million in software revenue, partially offset by an increase of $41.4 million in reagents revenue.
cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $1,210.9 million, as compared to $1,322.0 million for fiscal year 2022, a decrease of approximately $111.1 million, or 8%. as a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue increased to 44% in fiscal year
2023 from 40% in fiscal year 2022, resulting in a decrease in gross margin of approximately 411 basis points to 56% in fiscal year 2023 from 60% in fiscal year 2022 due to lower covid-19 revenue and an unfavorable shift in product mix, partially offset by pricing actions. the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions added an incremental expense of $45.3 million for fiscal year 2022. stock compensation expense related to awards given to biolegend employees post-acquisition added an incremental expense of $2.8 million for fiscal year 2023, as compared to $5.6 million for fiscal year 2022. the above decreases were partially offset by an increase in amortization of intangible assets which was $147.6 million for fiscal year 2023, as compared to $141.6 million for fiscal year 2022.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2023 were $1,022.6 million, as compared to $1,025.5 million for fiscal year 2022, a decrease of approximately $3.0 million, or 0.3%. as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 37% in fiscal year 2023 from 31% in fiscal year 2022. amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $217.5 million for fiscal year 2023, as compared to $229.1 million for fiscal year 2022. purchase accounting adjustments added an incremental expense of $4.3 million for fiscal year 2023, which primarily consisted of a change in contingent consideration, as compared to decreasing expenses by $1.2 million for fiscal year 2022. legal costs for significant litigation matters and settlements, net of reversals, were minimal for fiscal year 2023, as compared to decreasing expenses by $0.6 million for fiscal year 2022. acquisition and divestiture-related expenses, which primarily consisted of rebranding, legal and integration costs and stock compensation expense related to the awards given to biolegend employees post-acquisition, added an incremental expense of $62.0 million for fiscal year 2023, as compared to $28.9 million for fiscal year 2022. costs for significant environmental matters also added an incremental expense of $2.5 million for fiscal year 2023. restructuring and other, net, increased and was $26.6 million for fiscal year 2023, as compared to $13.6 million for fiscal year 2022. excluding the factors above, the net decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was the result of cost containment and productivity initiatives.
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal year 2023 were $216.6 million, as compared to $221.6 million for fiscal year 2022, a decrease of $5.0 million, or 2%. as a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses increased to 8% in fiscal year 2023 from 7% in fiscal year 2022. the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily driven by a cost containment and productivity initiatives, as well as a decrease in stock compensation expense related to awards given to biolegend employees post-acquisition, which was an expense of $4.3 million in fiscal year 2023, as compared to $5.4 million for fiscal year 2022. the decreased expenses were partially offset by our investments in new product development.
interest and other expense, net interest and other expense, net, consisted of the following for the fiscal years ended:

the increase of $26.7 million in interest and other expense, net, in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to an increase in other components of net periodic pension cost of $52.2 million, an increase in foreign exchange losses and other expense, net of $30.1 million and an increase in the change in fair value of financial securities of $18.2 million. other components of net periodic pension cost increased due to the decreases in the applicable discount rates. foreign exchange losses and other expense, net, increased primarily due to a foreign exchange loss of $24.0 million for the fiscal year 2023 related to the cash proceeds from the sale of the business that were held offshore. these increases in interest and other expense, net, were partially offset by an increase in interest income of $68.5 million and a decrease of $5.1 million in interest expense. interest income increased due to an increase in investments and higher interest rates. interest expense decreased due to $3.7 million of debt extinguishment income for the fiscal year 2023, as compared to $2.9 million of debt extinguishment income for the fiscal year 2022, as well as a result of an overall decrease in debt. a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading "liquidity and capital resources."
provision for income taxes the effective tax rates on continuing operations were 1.9% and 21.3% for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. the lower than expected 2023 tax rate will not repeat in 2024. a reconciliation of income tax expense at the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate to the recorded tax provision is as follows for the fiscal years ended:

certain countries in which we have operations have adopted legislation or are expected to adopt legislation influenced by the oecd pillar two rules, which imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% among other requirements. we will continue to evaluate the potential consequences of pillar two legislation on our effective tax rate as the legislation and related interpretations of oecd guidance continues to evolve.

discontinued operations on march 13, 2023, we completed the previously announced sale (the "closing") of certain assets and the equity interests of certain entities constituting our applied, food and enterprise services businesses (the "business") to perkinelmer topco, l.p. (formerly known as polaris purchaser, l.p.) (the "purchaser"), a delaware limited partnership owned by funds managed by affiliates of new mountain capital l.l.c. (the "sponsor"), for an aggregate purchase price of up to $2.45 billion. we received approximately $2.13 billion in cash proceeds, before transaction costs and subject to post-closing adjustments. we are entitled to an additional $75.0 million in proceeds as consideration for our ceasing the use of the perkinelmer brand and related trademarks and transferring them to the purchaser. this consideration is expected to be received in installments through the first half of 2025. the discounted value of the $75.0 million was measured as $65.2 million and was included in the proceeds. in addition, we are entitled to additional consideration of up to $150.0 million that is contingent on the exit valuation the sponsor and its affiliated funds receive on a sale or other capital events related to the business. the fair value of this element of consideration was determined to be $15.9 million and was included in the proceeds at closing. we also recorded a receivable of approximately $160.2 million as of december 31, 2023 for post-closing adjustments that are expected to be settled with the purchaser during fiscal year 2024. the final amount of the receivable related to the post-closing adjustments is subject to change.

the results of discontinued operations during fiscal year 2023 include the results of the business through march 13, 2023. during fiscal year 2023, we recognized an increase in provision for income taxes of $242.8 million, primarily related to the taxes on the gain on sale of the business. during fiscal year 2023, we recognized divestiture-related costs in gain on sale of $37.1 million. during fiscal year 2023, we recognized $36.0 million of divestiture-related costs in selling, general and administrative expenses in discontinued operations, as compared to $69.4 million during fiscal year 2022.
for a discussion of our discontinued operations for fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021, see item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 1, 2023 filed with the securities and exchange commission on march 1, 2023.
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. our principal sources of funds are cash flows from our operations, borrowing capacity available under our senior unsecured credit facility and access to the debt markets. we anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, smaller acquisitions, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. however, we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due, any larger acquisitions and other long-term liabilities, such as contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. the sale of the business generated approximately $2.13 billion in cash proceeds. we have used and expect to continue to use these proceeds for a combination of satisfying upcoming debt maturities, opportunistic share repurchases and continued strategic and value creating acquisitions.
we and our subsidiaries and affiliates may from time to time, in our sole discretion, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities (including any publicly issued debt securities), in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, or extend or refinance any of our outstanding indebtedness. additionally, we purchased u.s. treasury securities whose proceeds upon maturity are intended to be utilized to repay outstanding debt securities, including our 0.850% senior unsecured notes due in september 2024 (the "2024 notes"), which had $711.5 million in outstanding principal as of december 31, 2023.
principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:
•changes in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and
•changes in our working capital requirements.
principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:
•financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,
•increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,
•a ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,
•increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis,
•a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and
•volatility in the public debt and equity markets.

operating activities. net cash provided by continuing operations was $279.4 million for fiscal year 2023, as compared to $672.5 million for fiscal year 2022, a decrease of $393.1 million, primarily due to lower profitability from a decreased demand in covid-19 product offerings and more cash used in working capital during fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022. the cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2023 was principally a result of income from continuing operations of $179.5 million, adjustments for non-cash charges aggregating to $491.2 million, including depreciation and amortization of $431.8 million, and a net cash decrease in working capital of $391.3 million, primarily due to trailing divestiture-related liabilities with expected recovery from the post-closing adjustments related to the sale of the business. during fiscal year 2023, we contributed $10.0 million to our pension plan in the united states and $7.6 million, in the aggregate, to pension plans outside of the united states.

financing activities. net cash used in the financing activities of our continuing operations was $947.1 million for fiscal year 2023, as compared to $661.8 million for fiscal year 2022, an increase of $285.3 million. during fiscal year 2023, we made net payments of $517.5 million on debts, as compared to $559.2 million during fiscal year 2022. the changes in both periods reflect our intentions to pay down debt, which we expect to continue throughout fiscal year 2024. during fiscal year 2023, we repurchased shares of our common stock for a total cost of $388.9 million, as compared to $80.6 million in fiscal year 2022. we paid $35.0 million in dividends for fiscal year 2023, as compared to $35.3 million in fiscal year 2022. we paid $10.1 million for acquisition-related contingent consideration during fiscal year 2023. we paid $0.8 million in settlement of hedges in fiscal year 2022. the cash used in financing activities during fiscal year 2023 was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans of $4.3 million during fiscal year 2023, as compared to $14.1 million in fiscal year 2022.
fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021
for a discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021, see item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 1, 2023 filed with the securities and exchange commission on march 1, 2023.
borrowing arrangements during fiscal year 2023, we paid in full $467.1 million of outstanding 0.550% senior unsecured notes that became due in september 2023. since the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we have repurchased $88.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 notes. at december 31, 2023, we had investments in u.s. treasury securities with a carrying amount of $689.9 million whose proceeds upon maturity are intended to be utilized to repay the outstanding 2024 notes. see note 13, debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our borrowing arrangements.
dividends our board of directors (our "board") declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, resulting in an annual dividend rate of $0.28 per share. at december 31, 2023, we had accrued $8.6 million for a dividend declared in october 2023 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 that was paid in february 2024. on january 25, 2024, we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 that will be payable in may 2024. in the future, our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.
capital expenditures during fiscal year 2024, we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2023, primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, and to develop information technology. we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures.
other potential liquidity considerations at december 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $913.2 million, of which $429.0 million was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, and we had $1.49 billion of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. we had no other liquid investments at december 31, 2023. at december 31, 2023, we had investments in u.s. treasury securities with a carrying amount of $689.9 million whose proceeds upon maturity are intended to be utilized to repay our outstanding 2024 notes.
in connection with the sale of the business, we are entitled to an additional $75.0 million in proceeds as consideration for our ceasing the use of the perkinelmer brand and related trademarks and transferring them to the purchaser. this consideration is expected to be received in installments through the first half of 2025. in addition, we have also recorded a receivable of approximately $160.2 million as of december 31, 2023 for post-closing adjustments related to the sale of the business that is expected to be received during fiscal year 2024.
we use a variety of cash redeployment and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2023, we repatriated approximately $1.6 billion of foreign cash to the united states.
on july 22, 2022, our board authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to $300.0 million under a stock repurchase program (the "repurchase program"). on april 27, 2023, the repurchase program was terminated by the board and the board authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to $600.0 million under a new stock repurchase program (the "new repurchase program"). the new repurchase program will expire on april 26, 2025, unless terminated earlier by the board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. during fiscal year 2023, we repurchased 1,004,544 shares of common stock under the repurchase program for an aggregate cost of $131.3 million. during fiscal year 2023, we repurchased 2,159,985 shares of common stock under the new repurchase program for an aggregate cost of $244.6 million. as of december 31, 2023, $355.4 million remained available for aggregate repurchases of shares under the new repurchase program. if we continue to repurchase shares, the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
as of december 31, 2023, we may have to pay contingent consideration, related to acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to $98.0 million. as of december 31, 2023, we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of $40.0 million, of which $11.0 million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $29.0 million was recorded in long-term liabilities. the expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods is 7.9 years from december 31, 2023, and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at december 31, 2023 was 5.0 years.
distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability, creating increased volatility in security prices, widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments. the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold. increases in credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable, could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. in difficult global financial markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities.
our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets. with respect to plans outside of the united states, we expect to contribute $6.9 million in the aggregate during fiscal year 2024. during fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we contributed $7.6 million and $6.6 million in the aggregate, respectively, to pension plans outside of the united states. during fiscal year 2023, we contributed $10.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states for the plan year 2022. we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans. we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans.
effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements see note 1, nature of operations and accounting policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements. we did not adopt any new accounting pronouncements during fiscal year 2023. we are in the process of determining the impact of the recently issued accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted in our consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to accounting for business combinations, long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles and employee compensation and benefits. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
business combinations. business combinations are accounted for at fair value. acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense. measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings. the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. for intangible assets, we normally utilize the "income method" which incorporates the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows attributable to the subject intangible asset, adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. depending on the asset valued, the key assumptions included one or more of the following: (1) future revenue growth rates, (2) future gross margin, (3) future selling, general and administrative expenses, (4) royalty rates, (5) customer attrition rates, and (6) discount rates. if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed. the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period.
divestitures: as part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, we have discontinued certain businesses. in accounting for such transactions, we apply the applicable accounting guidance under u.s. gaap pertaining to discontinued operations and disposals of components of an entity. when the discontinued operations represented a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements, we accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. we recognize divestiture-related costs that are not part of divestiture consideration as general and administrative expense as they are incurred. these costs typically include transaction and disposal costs, such as legal, accounting, and other professional fees. the accounting for divestiture requires estimates and judgment as to the determination of the gain or loss on sale and the fair value of the different elements of consideration received. we received cash proceeds of $2.13 billion and we are entitled to two elements of additional consideration that become payable upon the resolution of certain events. first, we are entitled to proceeds of $75.0 million as consideration for our ceasing the use of the perkinelmer brand and related trademarks and transferring them to the purchaser ("brand sale"). this consideration is expected to be received in installments through the first half of 2025. we are also entitled to proceeds of up to $150.0 million that is contingent on the proceeds that the purchaser and its affiliates receive on a subsequent sale or other capital event related to the business ("contingent gain").
the recognition of the future payment related to the brand sale and contingent gain to the gain on sale and the fair value assigned to the contingent gain, are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. in deriving the fair value of the contingent gain, we utilized a lattice model, which incorporates one or more of the following key assumptions: (1) simulated equity value from the valuation date through the expected liquidity event, (2) volatility based on guideline public companies, (3) expected term to a liquidity event, and (4) risk-free rates. if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in the recognition of additional consideration which would increase the gain on sale or impairment of the receivable from the purchaser. the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results from continuing operations for the period.
we also recorded a receivable of approximately $160.2 million as of december 31, 2023 for post-closing adjustments related to the sale of the business that is expected to be received during fiscal year 2024. the final amount of the receivable related to the post-closing adjustments is subject to change and could result in an adjustment to the gain when settled.
value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles. we carry a variety of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment, operating lease right of use assets, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimates of fair values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. we undertake this review (i) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill, and (ii) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished. any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings.
for goodwill, the test consists of the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of goodwill. we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. we completed the annual goodwill impairment test using a measurement date of january 2, 2023, and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment. we consistently employ the income approach to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of goodwill. a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the income approach to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rates and working capital changes. cash flow forecasts are based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years' cash flows and historical relationships in later years. the income approach is sensitive to changes in long-term terminal growth rates and the discount rates. the long-term terminal growth rates are consistent with our historical long-term terminal growth rates, as the current short-term economic trends are not expected to affect our long-term terminal growth rates. we corroborate the income approach with a market approach. while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve, impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future. at january 2, 2023, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 20.0% for each reporting unit, except for the tulip and euroimmun reporting units, which had fair values that exceeded their carrying values by less than 20%. the range of the long-term terminal growth rates for the reporting units was 2.0% to 6.0% for the fiscal year 2023 impairment analysis. the range for the discount rates for the reporting units was 8.5% to 14.5%. keeping all other variables constant, a 10.0% change in any one of these input assumptions for the various reporting units, except for our tulip and euroimmun reporting units, would still allow us to conclude that there was no impairment of goodwill. at december 31, 2023, the operating performance of euroimmun reporting unit exceeded the original forecast and the forecast for this reporting unit no longer indicates any sensitivity that would lead to a material impairment charge.
in connection with the fiscal year 2024 impairment test performed as of january 1, 2024, the tulip and life sciences reporting units, which had goodwill balances of $75.0 million and $4.4 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2023, had fair values that exceeded their carrying values by less than 20%. these reporting units are at increased risk of an impairment charge given the higher discount rates, competition and, to some extent, the macro-environment in which these reporting units operate. despite the increased impairment risk associated with these reporting units, we do not believe there will be a significant change in the key estimates or assumptions driving the fair value of these reporting units that would lead to a material impairment charge.
employee compensation and benefits. we sponsor both funded and unfunded u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business, and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future, and therefore are subject to estimation. retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statements of operations. we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar month-end that is closest to our fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter, unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement.
we recognized a loss of $20.2 million in fiscal year 2023 and a gain of $28.3 million in fiscal year 2022, for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, which include the charge or benefit for the mark-to-market adjustment for the benefit plans, which were recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the loss or income related to the mark-to-market adjustment on benefit plans was a pre-tax loss of $5.7 million in fiscal year 2023 and a pre-tax gain of $28.9 million fiscal year 2022. we expect a loss of approximately $10.0 million in fiscal year 2024 for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, excluding the charge for or benefit from the mark-to-market adjustment. it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a mark-to-market adjustment in fiscal year 2024. mark-to-market adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control, including changes in interest rates, the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions. to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease, mark-to market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2024. conversely, to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected, mark-to market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2024. pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee's approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year. we use discount rates for each individual plan based upon the expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from a yield curve over the projected cash flow period.
if any of our assumptions were to change as of december 31, 2023, our pension plan expenses would also change as follows:
increase (decrease) at december 31, 2023

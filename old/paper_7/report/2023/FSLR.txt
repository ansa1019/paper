"risk factors," and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion and analysis does not address certain items in respect of the year ended december 31, 2021. see item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022 for comparative discussions of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021.
executive overview we are a leading american solar technology company and global provider of pv solar energy solutions. developed at our r&d labs in california and ohio, we manufacture and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology that provide a high-performance, lower-carbon alternative to conventional crystalline silicon pv solar modules. from raw material sourcing through end-of-life module recycling, we are committed to reducing the environmental impacts and enhancing the social and economic benefits of our products across their life cycle. we are the world's largest thin film pv solar module manufacturer and the largest pv solar module manufacturer in the western hemisphere.
certain of our financial results and other key operational developments for the year ended december 31, 2023 include the following:
•net sales for 2023 increased by 27% to $3.3 billion compared to $2.6 billion in 2022. the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of modules sold to third parties and an increase in the average selling price per watt sold, partially offset by the sale of our luz del norte pv solar power plant in the prior year.
•gross profit increased 36.5 percentage points to 39.2% in 2023 from 2.7% in 2022 primarily due to the recognition of the advanced manufacturing production credit under section 45x of the irc, reductions to sales freight costs, an increase in the average selling price per watt of our modules, continued module cost reductions, and the prior period sale and related impairment of the luz del norte pv solar power plant.
•during 2023, we commenced production of series 7 modules at our third manufacturing facility in ohio and our first manufacturing facility in india, bringing our total installed nameplate production capacity across all our facilities to approximately 16.6 gw. during 2023, we produced 12.1 gw and sold 11.4 gw of solar modules. during 2024, we expect to produce between 15.6 gw and 16.0 gw and sell between 15.6 gw and 16.3 gw.
•in june 2023, we entered into a credit agreement with several financial institutions, which provides us with a senior secured revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility") with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $1.0 billion. the facility, which is undrawn as of december 31, 2023, matures in 2028. see note 13. "debt" to our consolidated financial statements for more information about the revolving credit facility.
•in july 2023, we announced plans to expand our manufacturing capacity by an additional 3.5 gw by constructing our fifth manufacturing facility in the united states. this facility, which will be located in iberia parish, louisiana, is expected to commence operations in late 2025. such expansion plans, in combination with our previously announced expansion plans, are expected to increase our manufacturing capacity by approximately 8 gw by 2026.
•in october 2023, we began commercial production of our bifacial series 6 plus modules at certain manufacturing facilities in the u.s. our bifacial module features an innovative transparent back contact which, in addition to converting both front and rear side irradiance, allows infrared light to pass through rather than be absorbed as heat. this design lowers the operational temperature of the module, resulting in a higher energy yield.
•in december 2023, we entered into an agreement with fiserv, inc. ("fiserv") for the sale of $687.2 million of section 45x tax credits we generated during 2023 for aggregate cash proceeds of $659.7 million. we received initial cash proceeds of $336.0 million in january 2024 and expect to receive the remaining cash proceeds during the first half of 2024.
market overview solar energy is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to and/or substitute for traditional forms of energy generation. in recent years, the cost of producing electricity from pv solar power systems has decreased to levels that are competitive with or below the wholesale price of electricity in many markets. this price decline has opened new possibilities to develop systems in many locations with limited or no financial incentives, thereby promoting the widespread adoption of solar energy. other technological developments in the industry, such as the advancement of energy storage capabilities, have further enhanced the prospects of solar energy as an alternative to traditional forms of energy generation. in addition to these economic benefits, solar energy has substantial environmental benefits. for example, pv solar power systems generate no greenhouse gas or other emissions and use minimal amounts of water compared to traditional energy generation assets. as a result of these and other factors, worldwide solar markets continue to develop and expand. recently enacted government support programs, such as the ira discussed previously, have contributed and are expected to continue to contribute to this momentum by providing solar module manufacturers, project developers, and project owners with various incentives to accelerate the ongoing transition to clean energy. for more information about these support programs, see item 1. "business - support programs."
supply and demand. as a result of the market opportunities and increased demand described above, we are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity by approximately 8 gw, including the construction of our fourth manufacturing facility in the united states, which is expected to commence operations in the second half of 2024; our fifth manufacturing facility in the united states, which is expected to commence operations in late 2025; and the expansion of our manufacturing footprint at our existing facilities in ohio, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024. we continue to evaluate opportunities for future expansion worldwide. in the aggregate, we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules, particularly those in china, have significant installed production capacity, relative to global demand, and the ability for additional capacity expansion. accordingly, we believe the solar industry may experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand, which could lead to periods of pricing volatility. in light of such market realities, we continue to focus on our strategies and points of differentiation, which include our advanced module technology, our manufacturing process and distributed manufacturing presence, our r&d capabilities, the sustainability advantage of our modules, and our financial stability. as a result of this focus, we recently commenced production of series 7 modules at our third manufacturing facility in ohio and our first manufacturing facility in india.
pricing competition. the solar industry has been characterized by intense pricing competition, both at the module and system levels. this competition may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly, which could potentially increase demand for solar energy solutions but constrain the ability for project developers and module manufacturers to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability. our results of operations could be adversely affected if competitors reduce pricing below their costs, bid aggressively low prices for module sale agreements, or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time. for certain of our competitors, including many in china, these practices may be enabled by their direct or indirect access to sovereign capital or other forms of state support. although module average selling prices in many global markets have generally declined for several years, near-term module pricing in the united states, our primary market, remains strong primarily due to the rising demand for domestically manufactured modules as a result of the ira.
diverse offerings. we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other emerging technologies. solar module manufacturers compete with one another on sales price per watt, which may be influenced by several module value attributes, including energy yield, wattage (through a larger form factor or an improved conversion efficiency), degradation, sustainability, and reliability. sales price per watt may also be influenced by warranty terms, customer payment terms, and/or module content attributes. we believe that utility-scale solar will continue to be a compelling offering and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix. however, this focus on utility-scale module offerings exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar, which may influence our future offerings.
we continue to devote significant resources to support the implementation of our technology roadmap and improve the energy output of our modules. in the course of our r&d activities, we explore various technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation of our modules. such technologies include the development of bifacial modules, the implementation of our cure program, and ongoing research and development of multi-junction solar modules.
•bifacial. while conventional solar modules are monofacial, meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side, most module manufacturers offer bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module. bifaciality compromises nameplate efficiency, but by converting both front and rear side irradiance, such technology may improve the overall energy production of a module relative to nameplate efficiency when applied in certain applications, which could potentially lower the overall lcoe of a system when compared to systems using monofacial solar modules. we recently began commercial production of bifacial solar modules at certain of our manufacturing facilities in ohio. our bifacial module features an innovative transparent back contact which, in addition to converting both front and rear side irradiance, allows infrared light to pass through rather than be absorbed as heat. this design lowers the operational temperature of the module, resulting in a higher energy yield.
•cure. our cure program is intended to improve our current semiconductor structure by replacing copper with certain other elements that are expected to enhance module performance by improving its bifaciality characteristics, improving its temperature coefficient, and improving its warranted degradation. as a result of these performance improvements, our pv solar modules are expected to produce more energy in real world operating conditions over their estimated useful lives than crystalline silicon modules with the same nameplate capacity. in september 2023 and january 2024, we established new world record cdte research cell conversion efficiencies of 22.4% and 22.6%, respectively, which were based on our cure program and certified by the u.s. department of energy's national renewable energy laboratory. we currently expect to complete our lead line implementation of cure in the fourth quarter of 2024.
•multi-junction. we continue to evaluate opportunities to develop and leverage other solar cell technologies in multi-junction applications that combine our thin film pv technology with another high efficiency pv semiconductor, with each layer optimized for a different range of the solar spectrum. we believe such applications, which are expected to utilize at least one thin-film semiconductor, have the potential to significantly increase the efficiency of pv modules beyond the limits of traditional single-junction devices. our recent acquisition of evolar is expected to accelerate the development of high efficiency multi-junction devices by integrating evolar's know-how with first solar's existing r&d capabilities.
product efficiencies. we believe we are among the lowest cost module manufacturers in the solar industry on a module cost per watt basis, based on publicly available information. this cost competitiveness allows us to compete favorably in markets where pricing for modules and systems is highly competitive. our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our advanced thin film semiconductor technology, module wattage (or conversion efficiency), proprietary manufacturing process (which enables us to produce a cdte module in a matter of hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process, as opposed to a batch process), and our focus on operational excellence. in addition, our cdte modules use approximately 2% to 3% of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture conventional crystalline silicon solar modules. the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules, and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels. in recent years, polysilicon consumption per cell has been reduced through various initiatives, which have contributed to declines in our relative manufacturing cost competitiveness over conventional crystalline silicon module manufacturers.
energy performance. in many climates our solar modules provide certain energy production advantages relative to competing crystalline silicon solar modules. as a result, our solar modules can produce more annual energy in real world operating conditions than conventional crystalline silicon modules with the same nameplate capacity. for more information about these advantages, see item 1. "business - business strategy." additionally, we warrant that our solar modules will produce at least 98% of their labeled power output rating during the first year, with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor between 0.3% and 0.5%, depending on the module series, every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years.
while our modules are generally competitive in cost, reliability, and performance attributes, there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all. any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in further declines in the average selling prices of our modules and additional margin compression. we continue to focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our solar modules through our module technology and cost reduction roadmaps.
certain trends and uncertainties we believe that our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties. see item 1a. "risk factors" and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for discussions of other risks that may affect us.
our business is evolving worldwide and is shaped by the varying ways in which our offerings can be compelling and economically viable solutions to energy needs in various markets. in addressing electricity demands, we are focused on providing utility-scale module offerings in key geographic markets that we believe have a significant need for mass-scale pv solar electricity, including markets throughout the united states, india, and europe. we closely evaluate and monitor the appropriate level of resources required to support such markets and their associated sales opportunities. when deployed in utility-scale applications, our modules provide energy at a lower lcoe compared to traditional forms of energy generation, making them an attractive alternative to or replacement for aging fossil fuel-based generation resources. accordingly, future retirements of aging energy generation resources represent a significant increase in the potential market for solar energy.
demand for our pv solar module offerings depends, in part, on market factors outside our control. for example, many governments have proposed or enacted policies or support programs intended to encourage renewable energy investments to achieve decarbonization objectives and/or establish greater energy independence. while we compete in markets that do not require solar-specific government subsidies or support programs, our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives. adverse changes in these factors could increase the cost of utility-scale systems, which could reduce demand for our solar modules. recent developments to government support programs include the following:
•united states. in august 2022, the u.s. president signed the ira into law, which is intended to accelerate the country's ongoing transition to clean energy. among other things, the financial incentives provided by the ira have significantly increased demand for modules manufactured in the united states. accordingly, the demand for these solar modules is expected to increase domestic manufacturing in the near term, which may result in localized supply chain constraints and periods of inflationary pricing for certain of our key raw materials, including substrate glass and cover glass. the financial incentives provided by the ira have also increased demand for solar modules in general due to the incremental tax credit available for the qualified production of clean hydrogen that is powered by renewable resources. several aspects of the ira are pending technical guidance and regulations from the irs and u.s. treasury department, which earlier this year released a notice of intent to issue proposed regulations for the domestic content bonus tax credit and notices of proposed rulemaking and temporary regulations for the direct payment election and the tax credit transfer election. this initial guidance is subject to revision prior to the publishing of final regulations by the irs and u.s. treasury department. given the complexities of the ira, we continue to evaluate the extent of benefits available to us, which we expect will favorably impact our results of operations in future periods. for example, we currently expect to qualify for the advanced manufacturing production credit under section 45x of the irc, which provides certain specified benefits for solar modules and solar module components manufactured in the united states and sold to third parties. for more information about certain risks associated with the benefits available to us under the ira, see item 1a. "risk factors - we expect certain financial benefits as a result of tax incentives provided by the inflation reduction act of 2022. if these expected financial benefits vary significantly from our assumptions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected."
•india. in march 2023, the government of india allocated financial incentives under its pli scheme to certain pv module manufacturers, including first solar. the pli scheme is expected to provide aggregate funding of inr 185 billion ($2.3 billion), of which inr 11.8 billion ($143 million) was allocated to first solar, to promote the manufacturing of high efficiency solar modules in india and to reduce india's dependency on foreign imports of solar modules. under the pli scheme, manufacturers were selected through a competitive bid process and may be entitled to receive certain cash incentives over a five-year period following the commissioning of their manufacturing facilities. among other things, such incentives are subject to attaining certain minimum thresholds for module efficiency and temperature coefficient and require that a certain proportion of raw materials be sourced from the domestic market. such conditions will be evaluated on a quarterly basis from 2026 through 2031. at this time, it is uncertain to what extent we may qualify for such incentives.
demand for our solar energy solutions also depends on domestic or international trade policies and government regulations, which may be proposed, revised, and/or enacted across short- and long-term time horizons with varying degrees of impact to our net sales, profit, and manufacturing operations. changes in these policies and regulations could adversely impact the competitive landscape of solar markets, which could reduce demand for our solar modules. recent revisions or proposed changes to trade policy and government regulations include the following:
•united states. in june 2022, the u.s. president authorized the u.s. secretary of commerce to provide a 24-month antidumping and countervailing duty tariff exemption for imported solar panels from certain southeast asian countries. for more information about this development, see item 1a. "risk factors - the modification, reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies, economic incentives, tax incentives, renewable energy targets, and other support for on-grid solar electricity applications, or the impact of other public policies, such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules or related raw materials, could negatively impact demand and/or price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales or increase our costs, thereby adversely impacting our operating results."
•united states. in october 2023, a coalition of u.s. aluminum extruders and a labor union filed ad/cvd petitions with the usdoc related to aluminum extrusions from 15 countries. the usdoc has initiated investigations based on the petitions. first solar imports certain items that appear to be within the scope of the investigations. our operating results could be adversely impacted if the usdoc imposes duties on such imports.
•india. the almm was introduced in 2021 as a non-tariff barrier to incentivize domestic manufacturing of pv modules by approving the list of models and manufacturers who can participate in certain solar development projects. the almm is approved by the mnre, and any modifications to the almm and its application may affect future investments in solar module manufacturing in india. for more information about the almm, see item 1a. "risk factors - the modification, reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies, economic incentives, tax incentives, renewable energy targets, and other support for on-grid solar electricity applications, or the impact of other public policies, such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules or related raw materials, could negatively impact demand and/or price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales or increase our costs, thereby adversely impacting our operating results."
our ability to provide solar modules on economically attractive terms is also affected by the availability and cost of logistics services associated with the procurement of raw materials or equipment used in our manufacturing process and the shipping, handling, storage, and distribution of our modules. to mitigate certain logistics costs, we employ module contract structures that provide additional consideration to us if the cost of logistics services, excluding demurrage and detention, exceeds a defined threshold. we may also adjust our shipping plans to include additional lead times for module deliveries and/or utilize our network of u.s. distribution centers. additionally, our manufacturing capacity expansions in the u.s. and india are expected to bring manufacturing activities closer to customer demand, further mitigating our exposure to the cost of ocean freight.
we generally price and sell our solar modules on a per watt basis. as of december 31, 2023, we had entered into contracts with customers for the future sale of 78.3 gw of solar modules for an aggregate transaction price of $23.3 billion, which we expect to recognize as revenue through 2030 as we transfer control of the modules to the customers. such volume includes contracts for the sale of 39.1 gw of solar modules that include transaction price adjustments associated with future module technology improvements, including enhancements to certain energy related attributes. based on these potential technology improvements, the contracted module volumes as of december 31, 2023, the expected timing such technology improvements are incorporated into our manufacturing process, and the expected timing of module deliveries, such adjustments, if realized, could result in additional revenue of up to $0.5 billion, the majority of which would be recognized in 2025, 2026, and 2027. in addition to these price adjustments, certain of our contracts with customers may include favorable price adjustments associated with sales freight in excess of a defined threshold. certain of our contracts with customers may also include favorable or unfavorable price adjustments associated with changes to certain commodity prices and/or the module wattage committed for delivery. as a result, the revenue recognized from such contracts may increase or decrease in future periods relative to the original transaction price.
we continue to increase the nameplate production capacity of our existing manufacturing facilities by improving our production throughput, increasing module wattage (or conversion efficiency), and reducing manufacturing yield losses. additionally, we recently commenced production of series 7 modules at our third manufacturing facility in ohio and our first manufacturing facility in india, and we are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity by approximately 8 gw, including the construction of our fourth manufacturing facility in the united states, which is expected to commence operations in the second half of 2024; our fifth manufacturing facility in the united states, which is expected to commence operations in late 2025; and the expansion of our manufacturing footprint at our existing facilities in ohio, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024. this additional capacity, and any other potential investments to add to or otherwise modify our existing manufacturing capacity in response to market demand and competition, may require significant internal and possibly external sources of capital, and may be subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in item 1a. "risk factors," including those described under the headings "our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand, effectively manage our cost per watt, and, when necessary, continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to market demand, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties" and "if any future production lines are not built in line with committed schedules, it may adversely affect our future growth plans. if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines, our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers."

segment overview our primary segment is our modules business, which involves the design, manufacture, and sale of cdte solar modules, which convert sunlight into electricity. third-party customers of our modules segment include system developers, independent power producers, utilities, commercial and industrial companies, and other system owners and operators. our residual business operations include certain project development activities, operations and maintenance ("o&m") services, the results of operations from pv solar power systems we owned and operated in certain international regions, and the sale of such systems to third-party customers.
net sales we generally price and sell our solar modules on a per watt basis. during 2023, lightsource bp was the only customer that accounted for 10% or more of our modules business net sales, and the majority of our solar modules were sold to developers and operators of systems in the united states. substantially all of our modules business net sales during 2023 were denominated in u.s. dollars. we recognize revenue for module sales at a point in time following the transfer of control of the modules to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts. the revenue recognition policies for module sales are further described in note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements. net sales from our residual business operations primarily consists of revenue recognized for sales of development projects or completed systems, including any modules installed in such systems and any revenue from energy generated by such systems. in certain prior periods, our residual business operations also included o&m services we provided to third parties.

cost of sales decreased $531.5 million, or 21%, and decreased 36.5 percentage points as a percent of net sales when comparing 2023 with 2022. the decrease in cost of sales was driven by a $293.5 million decrease in our modules segment cost of sales primarily as a result of the following:
•the recognition of the advanced manufacturing production credit under section 45x of the irc, which decreased cost of sales by $659.7 million;
•lower sales freight, demurrage, and detention charges of $306.2 million; and
•continued module cost reductions, which decreased cost of sales by $85.3 million; partially offset by
•higher costs of $626.2 million from an increase in the volume of modules sold; and
•higher under-utilization charges of $81.5 million associated with the initial ramp of our first series 7 manufacturing facilities in ohio and india.
the decrease in cost of sales was also driven by a $238.0 million decrease in our residual business operations cost of sales primarily due to the sale of our luz del norte pv solar power plant in 2022 and the associated impairment loss in the same period. see note 8. "consolidated balance sheet details" to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of the impairment of our luz del norte project.
gross profit gross profit may be affected by numerous factors, including the selling prices of our modules and the selling prices of projects and services included in our residual business operations, our manufacturing costs, the capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities, and foreign exchange rates. gross profit may also be affected by the mix of net sales from our modules business and residual business operations.

our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions. the rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period. income tax expense increased by $7.7 million during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to higher pretax income in the current year, partially offset by the beneficial effect of tax law changes associated with the ira and higher prior period losses in certain jurisdictions for which no tax benefit could be recorded.
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2023, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flows from operating activities, and contracts with customers for the future sale of solar modules will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. in addition, we have availability under our revolving credit facility, under which we have made no borrowings as of december 31, 2023. as necessary, we also believe we will have adequate access to the capital markets. we monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity, both domestically and internationally. we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations, our overall cost of capital, and expected cash requirements for operations, including near-term construction activities and purchases of manufacturing equipment for our newest manufacturing and r&d facilities in the united states. however, our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to company-specific, industry-wide, or broader market concerns. any incremental debt financings could result in increased debt service expenses and/or restrictive covenants, which could limit our ability to pursue our strategic plans.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $2.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to $2.6 billion as of december 31, 2022. this decrease was primarily driven by purchases of property, plant and equipment for our u.s. and indian facilities, various operating expenditures, and certain advance payments of raw materials, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings under debt agreements and cash receipts from module sales, including advance payments for future sales. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, $1.2 billion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was primarily based in u.s. dollar denominated holdings. our investment policy seeks to preserve our investment principal and maintain adequate liquidity to meet our cash flow requirements, while at the same time optimizing the return on our investments. such policy applies to all invested funds, whether managed internally or externally. pursuant to such policy, we place our investments with a diversified group of high-quality financial institutions and limit the concentration of such investments with any one counterparty. we place significant emphasis on the creditworthiness of financial institutions and assess the credit ratings and financial health of our counterparty financial institutions when making investment decisions.
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. if certain international funds were needed for our operations in the united states, we may be required to accrue and pay certain u.s. and foreign taxes to repatriate such funds. we maintain the intent and ability to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings outside the united states, with the exception of certain subsidiaries for which applicable income taxes have been recorded as of december 31, 2023. in addition, changes to foreign government banking regulations may restrict our ability to move funds among various jurisdictions under certain circumstances, which could negatively impact our access to capital, resulting in an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.
although we compete in markets that do not require solar-specific government subsidies or support programs, such incentives continue to influence the demand for pv solar energy around the world. for example, the financial incentives provided by the ira are expected to increase both the demand for, and the domestic manufacturing of, solar modules in the united states. we continue to evaluate the extent of benefits available to us by the ira, which are expected to favorably impact our liquidity and capital resources in future periods. for example, we currently expect to qualify for the advanced manufacturing production credit under section 45x of the irc, which provides certain specified benefits for solar modules and solar module components manufactured in the united states and sold to third parties. such credit may be refundable by the irs or transferable to a third party and is available from 2023 to 2032, subject to phase down beginning in 2030. based on the current form factor of our modules, we expect to qualify for a credit of approximately 17 cents per watt for each module produced in the united states and sold to a third party. accordingly, we expect the advanced manufacturing production credit will provide us with a significant source of funding throughout its 10-year period. in december 2023, we entered into an agreement with fiserv for the sale of $687.2 million of section 45x tax credits we generated during 2023, for aggregate cash proceeds of $659.7 million. we received initial cash proceeds of $336.0 million in january 2024, and expect to receive the remaining cash proceeds during the first half of 2024. for more information about certain risks associated with the benefits available to us under the ira, see item 1a. "risk factors - "we expect certain financial benefits as a result of tax incentives provided by the inflation reduction act of 2022. if these expected financial benefits vary significantly from our assumptions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected." see note 9. "government grants" to our consolidated financial statements for further information about government grants.
as a result of various market opportunities and increased demand for our products, we commenced production of series 7 modules at our third manufacturing facility in ohio and our first manufacturing facility in india during 2023. we are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity by approximately 8 gw, including the construction of our fourth manufacturing facility in the united states, which is expected to commence operations in the second half of 2024; our fifth manufacturing facility in the united states, which is expected to commence operations in late 2025; and the expansion of our manufacturing footprint at our existing facilities in ohio, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024. in aggregate, we currently expect our remaining investment in these facilities and upgrades to be approximately $1.7 billion, which we expect to incur throughout 2024 and 2025. the capital expenditures necessary to expand our capacity may be financed, in part, by advance payments from customers for module sales in future periods, the advanced manufacturing production credit described above, and/or near-term bridge financing instruments.
in addition to the expansion plans described above, we continue to increase the nameplate production capacity of our existing manufacturing facilities by improving our production throughput, increasing module wattage (or conversion efficiency), and reducing manufacturing yield losses. we have a demonstrated history of innovation, continuous improvement, and manufacturing success driven by our significant investments in various r&d initiatives. we continue to invest significant financial resources in such initiatives, including approximately $0.2 billion of remaining investment for a dedicated r&d facility in the united states to support the implementation of our technology roadmap. we expect such r&d facility to feature a high-tech pilot manufacturing line, allowing for the production of full-sized prototypes of thin film and multi-junction pv modules. such r&d facility is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024. during 2024, we expect to spend between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, including the new facilities mentioned above, and upgrades to machinery and equipment that we believe will further increase our module wattage and expand capacity and throughput at our manufacturing facilities. these capital investments, and any other potential investments to implement our technology roadmap, may require significant internal and possibly external sources of capital and may be subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in item 1a. "risk factors," including those described under the headings "our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand, effectively manage our cost per watt, and, when necessary, continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to market demand, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties" and "if any future production lines are not built in line with committed schedules, it may adversely affect our future growth plans. if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines, our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers."
we have also committed and expect to continue committing significant working capital to purchase various raw materials used in our module manufacturing process. our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality, quantity, and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing costs. accordingly, we may enter into long-term supply agreements to mitigate potential risks related to the procurement of key raw materials and components, and such agreements may be noncancelable or cancelable with a significant penalty. for example, we have entered into long-term supply agreements for the purchase of certain specified minimum volumes of substrate glass and cover glass for our pv solar modules. we have the right to terminate certain of these agreements upon payment of specified termination penalties (which, in aggregate, are up to $595 million as of december 31, 2023 and decline over the remaining supply periods). additionally, for certain strategic suppliers, we have made, and may in the future be required to make, certain advance payments to secure the raw materials necessary for our module manufacturing.
we have also committed certain financial resources to fulfill our solar module collection and recycling obligations and have established a trust under which these funds are put into custodial accounts with an established and reputable bank. as of december 31, 2023, such funds were comprised of restricted marketable securities of $198.3 million and restricted cash and cash equivalents balances of $6.2 million. as of december 31, 2023, our module collection and recycling liability was $135.1 million. trust funds may be disbursed for qualified module collection and recycling costs (including capital and facility related recycling costs), payments to customers for assuming collection and recycling obligations, and reimbursements of any overfunded amounts. investments in the trust must meet certain investment quality criteria comparable to highly rated government or agency bonds. as necessary, we adjust the funded amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules, estimated rates of return on our restricted marketable securities, and an estimated solar module life of 25 years, less amounts already funded in prior years.
as of december 31, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other than financial assurance related instruments, which are not classified as debt. we do not guarantee any third-party debt. see note 14. "commitments and contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our financial assurance related instruments.
cash flows the following table summarizes key cash flow activity for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 (in thousands):

net increase in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents                                      $471,607                     $37,625                  $182,243
operating activities the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during 2023 was primarily driven by higher operating expenditures in support of our ongoing manufacturing expansion and lower advance payments received for future module sales, partially offset by higher cash receipts from modules sold in the current year.
investing activities the decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2023 was primarily due to higher maturities of marketable securities in the current year, partially offset by higher purchases of property, plant and equipment in the current year and proceeds from the sale of our japan project development business in the prior year.
financing activities the increase in net cash provided by financing activities during 2023 was primarily due to higher borrowings under the india credit facility in the current year compared to net borrowings under various debt arrangements in the prior year.
recent accounting pronouncements in december 2023, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2023-09, income taxes (topic 740) - improvements to income tax disclosures, which requires greater disaggregation of an entity's income tax disclosures. among other things, asu 2023-09 requires entities to disclose (i) specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation, (ii) pretax income or loss from continuing operations, separated between domestic and foreign jurisdictions, (iii) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations, separated by federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions, and (iv) income taxes paid to federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions. asu 2023-09 is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact asu 2023-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and associated disclosures.
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("u.s. gaap"), we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates. by their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience, our forecasts, and other available information as appropriate. the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements. the accounting policies that require the most significant judgment and estimates include the following:
accrued solar module collection and recycling liability. we previously established a module collection and recycling program, which has since been discontinued, to collect and recycle modules sold and covered under such program once the modules reach the end of their service lives. for legacy customer sales contracts that were covered under this program, we recognized expense at the time of sale for the estimated cost of our obligations to collect and recycle such modules. we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules, which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials; the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center; material, labor, and capital costs; and by-product credits for certain materials recovered during the recycling process. we base these estimates on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules and on certain assumptions regarding the estimated useful lives of modules covered by the program and the number of modules expected to be recycled. in the periods between the time of sale and the related settlement of the collection and recycling obligation, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability and classify the corresponding expense within "selling, general and administrative" expense on our consolidated statements of operations. we periodically review our estimates of expected future recycling costs and may adjust our liability accordingly. such adjustments are presented within "cost of sales" on our consolidated statements of operations. as of december 31, 2023, a 10% increase in the expected future recycling costs would increase the liability by $15.3 million.
product warranties. we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for up to 12.5 years. we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreed-upon specifications will produce at least 98% of their labeled power output rating during the first year, with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years. among other things, our solar module warranty also covers the resulting power output loss from cell cracking.
as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty, we have also offered an aggregated or system-level limited module performance warranty. this system-level limited module performance warranty is designed for utility-scale systems and provides 25-year system-level energy degradation protection. this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying, from the potential millions of modules installed in a utility-scale system, individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules. the system-level limited module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system's expected energy production, adjusted for certain actual site conditions, with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion, but never falling below 80% during the term of the warranty.
when we recognize revenue for sales of modules or projects, we accrue liabilities for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations. we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations, our historical experience with and projections of warranty claims, and our estimated per-module replacement costs. we also monitor our expected future module performance through certain quality and reliability testing and actual performance in certain field installation sites. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we revised this estimate based on updated information regarding our warranty claims, which reduced our product warranty liability by $5.4 million. this updated information reflected lower-than-expected warranty claims for our older series of module technology and revisions to projected settlements, resulting in reductions to our projected module return rate. in general, we expect the return rates for our series 6 and series 7 modules to be lower than our older series, and we estimate that the return rate for such newer series of module technology will be less than 1%. as of december 31, 2023, a 1% increase in the return rate across all series of module technology would increase our product warranty liability by $164.4 million.
government grants. we continue to evaluate the extent of benefits available to us pursuant to the ira, which we expect will favorably impact our results of operations in future periods. for example, we currently expect to qualify for the advanced manufacturing production credit under section 45x of the irc, which provides certain specified benefits for solar modules and certain solar module components manufactured in the united states and sold to third parties. for eligible components, the credit is equal to (i) $12 per square meter for a pv wafer, (ii) 4 cents multiplied by the capacity of a pv cell, and (iii) 7 cents multiplied by the capacity of a pv module. based on the current form factor of our modules, we expect to qualify for a credit of approximately 17 cents per watt for each module produced in the united states and sold to a third party. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recognized $687.2 million of section 45x credits as a reduction to "cost of sales."
there are currently several critical and complex aspects of the ira pending technical guidance and regulations from the irs and u.s. treasury department that could affect the estimated benefits we have recognized and expect to recognize from the advanced manufacturing production credit. for further information about the critical aspects of the ira that are pending technical guidance, see item 1a. "risk factors - we expect certain financial benefits as a result of tax incentives provided by the inflation reduction act of 2022. if these expected financial benefits vary significantly from our assumptions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected." any modifications to the law or its effects arising, for example, through (i) technical guidance and regulations from the irs and u.s. treasury department, (ii) subsequent amendments to or interpretations of the law, and/or (iii) future laws or regulations rendering certain provisions of the ira less effective or ineffective, in whole or in part, could result in material adverse changes to the benefits we have recognized and expect to recognize.
we recognize grants expected to be received directly from a government entity at their stated value. when we expect to transfer grants to a third party, we recognize the grants at, or adjust their carrying value to, the amount expected to be received from the transaction. accordingly, changes in the expected realization of the grants could affect our results of operations. additionally, the amount expected to be received from transfers to third parties may fluctuate based on market conditions or other factors that impact whether, and for how much, buyers are willing to purchase such credits.

item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our company is comprised of two reporting segments: north america and rest of world. our rest of world segment is primarily comprised of china, europe and india. both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas, heat pump and electric water heaters, boilers, tanks, and water treatment products. both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective region of the world.
we saw improvement in our supply chain during 2022, particularly in the second half of the year, which continued through 2023. we remain in close contact with our suppliers and logistics providers to resolve supply chain constraints as they arise.
we continue to seek acquisitions that enable geographic growth, expand our core business, and establish adjacencies. we will also continue to look for opportunities to add to our existing operations in high growth regions demonstrated by our previous introductions of water treatment products in india and kitchen products including our recently introduced dishwashers and steam ovens, in china. we also launched our internally designed and manufactured gas tankless water heaters in early 2024. in addition we are expanding our commercial water heater capacity in preparation for the 2026 commercial regulatory change.
in our north america segment, we saw resilient demand in the residential water heater industry in 2023 after three years of uneven growth, primarily related to the impacts of covid-19-related supply chain constraints. proactive replacement remained above historical levels in 2023 and we project that will continue in 2024. we believe that new home construction remains in a deficit and we expect it will be flat in 2024 compared to 2023. considering these factors, we project 2024 industry residential unit volumes will be approximately flat after approximately six percent growth in 2023. we believe that commercial water heater industry volumes will grow low single digits in 2024 compared to 2023 as demand for commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallon continues a positive trend toward pre-2022 levels. sales of our boilers and water treatment products were negatively impacted by elevated channel inventories in 2023. we believe that channel inventories were at near normal levels at the end of 2023 for both product categories. we expect to see an eight to ten percent increase in our sales of boilers in 2024 compared to 2023 as we continue to benefit from the transition to higher efficiency boilers. we anticipate sales of our north america water treatment products will increase approximately ten to 12 percent in 2024, compared to 2023, as we expect our sales to grow at approximately two times the market.
in our rest of world segment, we saw a return to growth in china as our sales increased four percent in local currency in 2023. we project our sales in china will grow three to five percent in 2024 in local currency compared to 2023 driven by innovative new products and resilient demand for our core products. our guidance assumes that the currency translation impact on sales will be minimal in 2024.
combining all of these factors, we expect our 2024 consolidated sales to increase between three and five percent compared to 2023. our guidance excludes the impacts from potential future acquisitions.
results of operations in this section, we discuss the results of our operations for 2023 compared with 2022. we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under "liquidity and capital resources." for a discussion related to 2022 compared with 2021, please refer to item 7 of part ii, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, which was filed with the united states securities and exchange commission (sec) on february 14, 2023, and is available on the sec's website at www.sec.gov.

our sales in 2023 were $3,852.8 million, or 2.6 percent higher than 2022 sales of $3,753.9 million. higher sales in 2023 were driven by higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters, which more than offset unfavorable foreign currency impacts of approximately $56 million, lower boiler sales and unfavorable pricing in our north america segment.
our gross profit margin in 2023 of 38.5 percent increased compared to 35.4 percent in 2022. the higher gross profit margin in 2023 was primarily due to lower material costs.
selling, general, and administrative (sg&a) expenses were $727.4 million in 2023, or $56.5 million higher than in 2022. the increase in sg&a expenses was primarily due to higher employee costs, which includes management incentive expenses related to higher earnings, and compensation increases. in 2022 sg&a included the recognition of an $11.5 million favorable judgment against a competitor related to its infringement of one of our patents, which reduced sg&a expenses, and was partially offset by a $4.3 million expense associated with a terminated acquisition.
restructuring and impairment expenses in 2023 were $18.8 million, of which $15.6 million related to the sale of our business in turkey which was included in our rest of world segment. of the $18.8 million restructuring and impairment expenses, $15.7 million was recorded in the rest of world segment and $3.1 million in corporate expense.
interest expense was $12.0 million in 2023, compared to $9.4 million in 2022. the increase in interest expense in 2023 was primarily due to higher debt levels and interest rates.
other (income) expense, net was income of $6.9 million in 2023 compared to expense of $425.6 million in 2022. the change in other (income) expense, net was primarily due to a reduction in pension expenses and pension settlement expense associated with the termination of our defined benefit pension plan (the plan). in 2022, we recorded a $417.3 million pension settlement expense related to the termination of the plan which represented over 95 percent of our pension plan liability. the service cost component of our pension expense is reflected in cost of products sold and sg&a expenses. all other components of our pension expense (income) are reflected in other (income) expense-net.
our effective income tax rate in 2023 was higher than our effective income tax rate in 2022 primarily due to the tax effects of the pension settlement expense associated with the termination of the plan and a change in geographic earnings mix. we estimate that our annual effective income tax rate for the full year of 2024 will be approximately 24 to 24.5 percent.
we are providing non-u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) measures (adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share (eps), total segment earnings, adjusted segment earnings, and adjusted corporate expense) that exclude the impact of restructuring and impairment expenses, pension settlement income and expenses, non-operating pension expenses, income from a legal judgment and expenses associated with a terminated acquisition. reconciliations from gaap measures to non-gaap measures are provided in the non-gaap measures section below. we believe that the measures of adjusted earnings, adjusted eps, total segment earnings, adjusted segment earnings, and adjusted corporate expense provide useful information to investors about our performance and allow management and our investors to better understand our performance between periods without regard to items that we do not consider to be a component of our core operating performance or recurring in nature.

sales in our north america segment were $2,922.9 million in 2023, or $103.8 million higher than sales of $2,819.1 million in 2022. the increased sales in 2023 compared to the prior year were primarily driven by higher residential and commercial water heater volumes, partially offset by lower volumes of boilers and unfavorable pricing.
north america segment earnings were $726.7 million in 2023, or $460.7 million higher than segment earnings of $266.0 million in 2022. segment margins were 24.9 percent and 9.4 percent in 2023 and 2022, respectively. higher segment earnings and margins in 2023 were primarily due to higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters and lower material costs that were partially offset by higher sg&a expenses. additionally in 2022, we realized pre-tax pension settlement expense of $346.8 million.
adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2023 were $726.0 million and 24.8 percent, respectively which exclude $0.7 million of pension settlement income. adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2022 were $611.0 million and 21.7 percent, respectively and exclude pension settlement expense of $346.8 million, pension expense of $9.7 million and the recognition of the $11.5 million patent infringement judgment. we estimate our 2024 north america segment margin will be approximately 24.5 to 25 percent.

sales in our rest of world segment were $956.9 million in 2023, or $8.9 million lower than sales of $965.8 million in 2022. the decrease in sales in 2023 was primarily driven by the approximately $44 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by favorable volumes in china, particularly in our water treatment and kitchen products.
rest of world segment earnings in 2023 were $83.4 million compared to $96.3 million in 2022. segment margins were 8.7 percent and 10.0 percent in 2023 and 2022, respectively. lower segment earnings and segment margin in 2023 were primarily driven by restructuring and impairment expenses of $15.7 million, of which $12.5 million was associated with the sale of our business in turkey.
adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2023 were $99.1 million and 10.4 percent, respectively. adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2023 exclude restructuring and impairment expenses. we estimate our 2024 rest of world segment margin will be approximately 10 percent.
liquidity and capital resources our working capital was $555.0 million at december 31, 2023 compared with $699.5 million at december 31, 2022. movements in working capital consisted of lower cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities due to the paydown of our long-term debt and trade payables. in addition, as of december 31, 2023, cash balances were negatively impacted by $12.8 million due to changes in foreign currency. cash and cash equivalents used to fund our operations are primarily generated through operating activities and provided by our existing credit facilities. we believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. we use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany borrowing, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate capital resources among various entities. we have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the united states from certain foreign subsidiaries. in 2023, we repatriated approximately $100 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries through dividends and approximately $200 million through our global cash pooling arrangement. we used the proceeds to pay down outstanding debt balances.

cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was $670.3 million compared with $391.4 million during 2022. the increase in operating cash flows in 2023 compared with the prior year is due to increased earnings and a more favorable working capital contribution primarily related to lower inventory levels and incentive payments. our free cash flow in 2023 and 2022 was $597.7 million and $321.1 million, respectively. we expect cash provided by operating activities to be between $640 million and $690 million in 2024. we expect free cash flow to be between $525 million to $575 million in 2024. free cash flow is a non-gaap measure and is described in more detail in the non-gaap measures section below.
our capital expenditures were $72.6 million in 2023 and $70.3 million in 2022. we project our 2024 capital expenditures will be between $105 and $115 million and expect depreciation and amortization will be approximately $70 million.
in 2021, we renewed and amended our $500 million revolving credit facility, which now expires on april 1, 2026. the renewed and amended facility, with a group of nine banks, has an accordion provision that allows it to be increased up to $850 million if certain conditions (including lender approval) are satisfied. borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio. the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants, a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test, and we were in compliance with the covenants as of december 31, 2023, and expect to be in compliance for the foreseeable future. the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings. at december 31, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the facility and an available borrowing capacity of $500 million. we believe the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flows will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future.
our total debt decreased by $217.2 million in 2023 primarily due to the use of operating cash flows to pay down debt. our leverage, as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization, was 6.5 percent at december 31, 2023, compared with 16.5 percent at december 31, 2022.
our remaining u.s. pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations. we were not required to make a contribution to our pension plan in 2023. we forecast that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2024, and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions in 2024. for further information on our pension plans, see note 13, "pension and other post-retirement benefits" of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
in 2023, our board of directors approved adding 7,500,000 shares of common stock to our existing discretionary share repurchase authority. under our share repurchase program, we may purchase our common stock through a combination of a rule 10b5-1 automatic trading plan and discretionary purchases in accordance with applicable securities laws. the stock repurchase authorization remains effective until terminated by our board of directors, which may occur at any time, subject to the parameters of any rule 10b5-1 automatic trading plan that we may then have in effect. during 2023, we repurchased 4,377,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $306.5 million. as of december 31, 2023, we had 3,501,462 shares remaining on the share repurchase authority. on january 26, 2024, the board of directors approved adding 2,000,000 shares of common stock to the existing discretionary share repurchase authority. including the additional shares, we have 5,202,462 shares available for repurchase as of the date of the board of directors' approval. we intend to repurchase approximately $300 million of our common stock in 2024 through a combination of 10b5-1 plans and open-market purchases.
we paid dividends of $1.22 per share in 2023 compared with $1.14 per share in 2022. we increased our dividend by seven percent in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the five-year compound annual growth rate of our dividend payment is approximately 10 percent. we have paid dividends for 84 consecutive years with annual amounts increasing each of the last 32 years.
recent accounting pronouncements refer to recent accounting pronouncements in note 1, "organization and significant accounting policies" of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note 1, "organization and significant accounting policies" of notes to the consolidated financial statements. also as disclosed in note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements.
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and significant estimates used in the determination of the liability related to product warranties. various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates. the process of determining significant estimates is fact-specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends, and in some cases, actuarial techniques. we monitor these significant factors and adjustments are made as facts and circumstances dictate. historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in conformity with gaap, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fair-value method based on management's judgments and assumptions. the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms-length basis. the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including recorded goodwill. we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets become impaired. any impairment review is, by its nature, highly judgmental as estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values. however, we believe that we conduct a thorough and competent annual quantitative analysis of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. based on the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined there was no impairment of our goodwill as of december 31, 2023. the fair value of each of our reporting units significantly exceeded its carrying value and a 20 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would not have resulted in a different conclusion. based on the annual indefinite-lived assets impairment test, we determined there was no impairment of our indefinite-lived assets as of december 31, 2023.
product warranty our products carry warranties that generally range from one to 12 years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market. we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale. the product warranty provision is estimated based on warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement. the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed at least annually. at times, warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience. we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable. while our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates, it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates. the allocation of the warranty liability between current and long-term is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, our reserve for product warranties was $188.1 million and $182.5 million, respectively.
non-gaap measures we are providing non-u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) measures (adjusted earnings, adjusted eps, total segment earnings, adjusted segment earnings, and adjusted corporate expense) that exclude the impact of restructuring and impairment expenses, pension settlement income and expenses, non-operating pension expenses, income from a legal judgment and expenses associated with a terminated acquisition. reconciliations from gaap measures to non-gaap measures are provided below.
we believe that the measures of adjusted earnings, adjusted eps, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expense provide useful information to investors about our performance and allow management and our investors to better understand our performance between periods without regard to items that we do not consider to be a component of our core operating performance or recurring in nature.

adjusted eps (non-gaap)                                     $3.90 - 4.15                        $3.81
(1) includes pre-tax restructuring and impairment expenses of $15.7 million and $3.1 million, within the rest of world segment and corporate expenses, respectively.
outlook as we begin 2024, we expect our consolidated sales to increase between three and five percent. our sales projection is driven by continued end-market demand in water heating and a rebound in boiler and water treatment volumes after 2023 corrections in end-market inventories. in our rest of the world segment, we see overall growth with stability in china as the economy continues to work through its challenges. we expect to achieve full-year earnings of between $3.90 and $4.15 per share. our guidance excludes the impacts from potential future acquisitions.
other matters environmental our operations are governed by a number of federal, foreign, state, local and environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials, the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties. we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws. expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2023 and we do not expect them to be material in any single year. we have reserves associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves together with available insurance coverage are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs. although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance, there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future. however, since the same laws govern our competitors, we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage.
risk management we evaluate risk to our business in a number of ways, primarily through our enterprise risk management (erm) process, which we conduct enterprise-wise on a periodic basis, and seeks to identify and address significant and material risks. our erm process assesses, manages, and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in the enterprise risk management-integrated framework (2017) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). we believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our strategy. our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoid risks. we can mitigate risks and their impact on our company only to a limited extent.
a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks, including decarbonization, new technologies and cyber threats among others, and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks. our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks. the audit committee of the board of directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them. our other board committees also play a role in risk management, as set forth in their respective charters.
our goal is to proactively manage risks using a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareholder value. however, the risks set forth in item 1a - risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k and other risks and uncertainties could adversely affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
market risk we are exposed to various types of market risks, primarily currency. we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward contracts to minimize such exposures. we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies. further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1, "organization and significant accounting policies" of notes to consolidated financial statements.
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies. at december 31, 2023, we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding with notional values of $118.8 million. assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies, the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in exchange rates would amount to $11.9 million. however, gains and losses from our forward contracts will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged.

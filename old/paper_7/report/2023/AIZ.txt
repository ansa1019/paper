item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. it contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under the headings "item 1a - risk factors" and "forward-looking statements."
general segment information as of december 31, 2023, we had two reportable operating segments which are defined based on the manner in which the company's chief operating decision maker, our ceo, reviews the business to assess performance and allocate resources, and which align to the nature of the products and services offered:
•global lifestyle: includes mobile device solutions (including extended service contracts, insurance policies and related services), extended service contracts and related services for consumer electronics and appliances, and credit and other insurance products (referred to as "connected living"); and vehicle protection services, commercial equipment services and other related services (referred to as "global automotive"); and
•global housing: includes lender-placed homeowners, manufactured housing and flood insurance, as well as voluntary manufactured housing, condominium and homeowners insurance (referred to as "homeowners"); and renters insurance and other products (referred to as "renters and other").
in addition, we report the corporate and other segment, which includes corporate employee-related expenses and activities of the holding company.
we define adjusted ebitda, our segment measure of profitability, as net income from continuing operations, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and fair value changes to equity securities, non-core operations (which consists of certain businesses which we have fully exited or expect to fully exit, including the long-tail commercial liability businesses (sharing economy and small commercial businesses), as well as certain legacy long-duration insurance policies and our operations in mainland china), restructuring costs related to strategic exit activities (outside of normal periodic restructuring and cost management activities), assurant health runoff operations, interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, as well as other highly variable or unusual items.
the following discussion covers the year ended december 31, 2023 ("twelve months 2023") and the year ended december 31, 2022 ("twelve months 2022"). please see the discussion that follows, for each of these segments, for a more detailed comparative analysis. our comparative analysis of twelve months 2022 and the year ended december 31, 2021 is included under the heading "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022 filed with the sec on february 17, 2023.
executive summary summary of financial results consolidated net income increased $365.9 million, or 132%, to $642.5 million for twelve months 2023 from $276.6 million for twelve months 2022, primarily due to higher global housing segment earnings, including lower reportable catastrophes (defined as individual catastrophic events that generate losses in excess of $5.0 million pre-tax, net of reinsurance and client profit sharing adjustments, and including reinstatement and other premiums), and lower net unrealized losses from changes in the fair value of equity securities.
global lifestyle adjusted ebitda decreased $17.1 million, or 2%, to $792.3 million for twelve months 2023 from $809.4 million for twelve months 2022. the decline was driven by global automotive as elevated claims costs were partially offset by higher investment income. connected living results were up modestly, as stronger mobile device protection results in north america and higher investment income were partially offset by lower mobile results in asia pacific.
global lifestyle net earned premiums, fees and other income increased $499.5 million, or 6%, to $8.56 billion for the twelve months 2023 from $8.06 billion for twelve months 2022, primarily due to prior period sales within global automotive.
global housing adjusted ebitda increased $328.2 million, or 133%, to $574.2 million for twelve months 2023 from $246.0 million for twelve months 2022, primarily driven by the factors noted below, including $60.4 million of lower pre-tax reportable catastrophes. excluding reportable catastrophes, adjusted ebitda increased $267.8 million, or 64%, mainly due to lower non-catastrophe loss experience, including $54.1 million of favorable prior year reserve development in 2023 compared to $15.5 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2022. strong top-line growth in homeowners and expense leverage from scale and operational efficiencies also drove performance.
global housing net earned premiums, fees and other income increased $258.3 million, or 14%, to $2.14 billion for twelve months 2023 from $1.88 billion for twelve months 2022, largely driven by homeowners top-line growth, which was driven by higher average premiums and growth in policies-in-force within lender-placed insurance.
corporate and other adjusted ebitda was $(109.0) million for twelve months 2023 compared to $(99.2) million for twelve months 2022, primarily driven by lower investment income and higher employee-related expenses.
critical factors affecting results our results depend on, among other things, the appropriateness of our product pricing, underwriting, the accuracy of our reserving methodology for future policyholder benefits and claims, the frequency and severity of reportable and non-reportable catastrophes, returns on and values of invested assets, our investment income, and our ability to realize greater operational efficiencies and manage our expenses. our results also depend on our ability to profitably grow our businesses, including our connected living and global automotive businesses, and the performance of our homeowners business. factors affecting these items, including conditions in the financial markets, the global economy, political conditions and the markets in which we operate, fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and inflation, including the current period of inflationary pressures which have impacted claims costs primarily in the homeowners and the global automotive businesses, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. for more information on these and other factors that could affect our results, see "item 1a - risk factors."
our results may also be impacted by our ability to continue to grow in the markets in which we operate, including in our connected living and global automotive businesses, which will be impacted by our ability to provide a superior digital-first customer experience, including from our investments in technology and digital initiatives, capitalize on the connected home opportunity and investments to onboard and ramp-up new business. our mobile business is subject to volatility in mobile device trade-in volumes and margins based on the actual and anticipated timing of the release of new devices, carrier promotional programs and sales prices for used devices, as well as to changes in consumer preferences. our homeowners revenue is impacted by changes in the housing market. in addition, across many of our businesses, we must respond to competitive pressures, including the threat of disruption and competition for talent, which has increased due to labor shortages and wage inflation. see "item 1a - risk factors - business, strategic and operational risks - significant competitive pressures, changes in customer preferences and disruption could adversely affect our results of operations," " - our mobile business is subject to the risk of declines in the value and availability of mobile devices, and to regulatory compliance and other risks" and " - the success of our business depends on the execution of our strategy, including through the continuing service of key executives, senior leaders, highly-skilled personnel and a high-performing workforce."
for twelve months 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.14 billion; net cash used in investing activities was $637.7 million; and net cash used in financing activities was $403.9 million. we had $1.63 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2023. please see " - liquidity and capital resources" below for further details.
revenues we generate revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance policies, service contracts and related products and services, and from income earned on our investments. sales of insurance policies are recognized in revenue as earned premiums while sales of administrative services are recognized as fee income.
our premium and fee income is supplemented by income earned from our investment portfolio. we recognize revenue from interest payments, dividends, change in market value of equity securities and sales of investments. currently, our investment portfolio is primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. both investment income and changes in market value on these investments can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
interest rate volatility can increase or reduce unrealized gains or losses in our investment portfolios. interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, inflation and other factors beyond our control. fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on, and the market value of, fixed maturity and short-term investments.
the fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. the fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities generally increases or decreases with fluctuations in interest rates. we also have investments that are subject to pre-payment risk, such as mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. interest rate fluctuations may cause actual net investment income and/or timing of cash flows from such investments to differ from estimates made at the time of investment. in periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage obligations and bonds are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates. therefore, in these circumstances we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest-earning investments.
please see "item 7a - quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" below for further details.
expenses our expenses are primarily policyholder benefits, underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses and interest expense.
policyholder benefits are affected by our claims management programs, reinsurance coverage, contractual terms and conditions, regulatory requirements, economic conditions including inflation, and numerous other factors. benefits paid or reserves required for future benefits could substantially exceed our expectations, causing a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees, amortization of deferred costs, general operating expenses and income taxes. in addition to the restructuring plan announced in december 2022 and amended in 2023, we continue to undertake various expense savings initiatives while also making investments in talent, capabilities and technology, among other things, which will impact our expenses.
we also incur interest expense related to our debt.
critical accounting policies and estimates certain items in our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and judgment. differences between actual results and these estimates and judgments could in some cases have material impacts on our consolidated financial statements. the following critical accounting policies require significant estimates and judgment:
•reserves, net of reinsurance
•valuation of investments
•valuation and recoverability of goodwill reserves, net of reinsurance reserves are established using generally accepted actuarial methods and reflect significant judgment and estimates about expected future claim payments. factors used in their calculation include experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions. calculations incorporate assumptions about the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported, reporting lags, expenses, inflation rates, future investment earnings, internal claims processing costs and other relevant factors. while the methods of making such estimates and establishing the related liabilities are periodically reviewed and updated, the estimation of reserves includes an element of uncertainty given that management is using historical information and methods to project future events and reserve outcomes.
the recorded reserves represent our best estimate at a point in time of the ultimate costs of settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims, based upon actuarial assumptions and projections using facts and circumstances known at the time of calculation. the adequacy of reserves may be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. these variables are affected by both external and internal events, including: changes in the economic cycle, inflation, changes in repair costs, natural or human-made catastrophes, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handling procedures.
many of these items are not directly quantifiable and not all future events can be anticipated when reserves are established. reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such estimates are updated.
because establishment of reserves is an inherently complex process involving significant judgment and estimates, there can be no certainty that future settlement amounts for claims incurred through the financial reporting date will not vary from reported claims reserves. future loss development could require reserves to be increased or decreased, which could have a material effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases or decreases are made. however, based on information currently available, we believe our reserve estimates are adequate. see "item 1a - risk factors - financial risks - our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, requiring us to establish additional reserves or to incur additional expense for settling unreserved liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, profitability and capital" and " - financial risks - actual results may differ materially from the analytical models we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management" for more detail on this risk.
reinsurance recoverables we utilize reinsurance for loss protection and capital management, business dispositions and client risk and profit sharing. reinsurance premiums paid are amortized as reductions to premium over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies. amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. reinsurance recoverables include amounts we are owed by reinsurers for claims paid as well as those included in reserve estimates that are subject to the reinsurance.
we use a probability of default and loss given default methodology in estimating an expected credit loss allowance, whereby the credit ratings of reinsurers are used in determining the probability of default. the allowance is established for reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid future policy benefits and claims and benefits. prior to applying default factors, the net exposure to credit risk is reduced for any collateral for which the right of offset exists, such as funds withheld, assets held in trust and letters of credit, which are part of the reinsurance arrangements, with adjustments to include consideration of credit exposure on the collateral. our methodology incorporates historical default factors for each reinsurer based on their credit rating using comparably rated bonds as published by a major ratings service. the allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing and other relevant factors.
in the ordinary course of business, we are involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with non-affiliated companies. the following table provides details of the reinsurance recoverables balance as of december 31, 2023 and 2022:

for additional information regarding our reserves and reinsurance recoverables, see notes 2, 5, 17 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
short duration contracts claims and benefits payable reserves for short duration contracts include (1) case reserves for known claims which are unpaid as of the balance sheet date; (2) ibnr reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. periodically, we review emerging experience and make adjustments to our reserves and assumptions where necessary.
ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses are estimated utilizing generally accepted actuarial loss reserving methods. both paid claims development as well as case incurred development are typically analyzed at the product or product grouping level, considering product size and data credibility. the reserving methods widely employed by us include the chain ladder, munich chain ladder and bornhuetter-ferguson methods. for global housing, reportable catastrophes are analyzed and reserved for separately using a frequency and severity approach.
the methods all involve aggregating paid and case-incurred loss data by accident quarter (or accident year) and accident age for each product grouping. as the data ages, development factors are calculated that measure emerging claim development patterns between reporting periods. by selecting loss development factors indicative of remaining development, known losses are projected to an ultimate incurred basis for each accident period. the underlying premise of the chain ladder method is that future claims development is best estimated using past claims development, whereas the bornhuetter-ferguson method employs a combination of past claims development and prior estimates of ultimate losses based on an expected loss ratio. the munich chain ladder method incorporates the correlations between paid and incurred development in projecting future development factors, and is typically more applicable to products experiencing variability in incurred to paid ratios.
each of these methods applied to the data groupings produces an estimate of the loss reserves for the product grouping. the best estimate is generally selected from a blend of the different methods. the ibnr associated with the best estimate is then allocated to accident year based on a weighting of the underlying actuarial methods. the determination of the best estimate is based on many factors, including:
•the nature and extent of the underlying assumptions;
•the quality and applicability of historical data - whether internal or industry data;
•current and expected future economic and market conditions;
•regulatory, legislative, and judicial considerations;
•the extent of data segmentation - data should be homogeneous yet credible enough for loss development methods to apply;
•trends in loss frequency and severity for various causes of loss;
•consideration of the distribution of loss reserves, management's selection of the best estimate that may exceed an estimate based on median values, suggesting that favorable development may be more likely than unfavorable development; and
•hindsight testing of prior loss estimates - the loss estimates on some product lines will vary from actual loss experience more than others.
when employing the reserving methods, consideration is given to contractual requirements, historical utilization trends and payment patterns, coverage changes, seasonality, product mix, the legislative and regulatory environment, economic factors, natural catastrophes and other relevant factors. we consistently apply reserving principles and methodologies from year to year, while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors.
while management has used judgment in establishing its best estimate of required reserves, different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates. two key measures of loss activity are loss frequency, which is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure, and loss severity, which is a measure of the average size of claims. factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls, changes in economic activity and weather patterns. factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits, retentions, rate of inflation and judicial interpretations.
if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected, the ultimate reserves required will be different than management's estimate. the effect of higher and lower levels of loss frequency and severity on our ultimate costs for claims occurring in 2023 would be as follows:
change in both loss frequency and severityfor all global lifestyle and global housing        ultimate cost of claimsoccurring in 2023   change in cost of claimsoccurring in 2023

(1)represents the sum of the case reserves and incurred but not reported reserves as of december 31, 2023 for global lifestyle and global housing.
non-core operations short duration contracts in non-core operations primarily consist of the sharing economy and small commercial products previously reported within global housing. while the contracts are classified as short duration, the coverages were predominantly commercial liability and have a long reporting and settlement tail compared to property coverages which make up most of our core operations.
the reserving methodology described for other short duration contacts is applicable for non-core operations. given the nature of commercial liability coverages and its relatively long claim runoff duration, additional emphasis is placed on elevated loss activity from increasing attorney involvement and analysis of individual case reserve adequacy on known claims. this is done through use of average cost per claim methods that include an allowance for future inflation impacts, detailed open claim inventory analysis, and leveraging industry development patterns to supplement our own historical claims experience.
long duration contracts, including disposed and runoff long duration lines reserves for future policy benefits represent the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. reserve assumptions reflect best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality, morbidity, expenses and withdrawal rates. these assumptions are based on our experience to the extent it is credible, modified where appropriate to reflect current trends, industry experience and provisions for possible unfavorable deviation. we also record an unearned revenue reserve which represents premiums received which have not yet been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.
risks related to the reserves recorded for certain discontinued individual life, annuity and long-term care insurance policies have been fully ceded via reinsurance. while we have not been released from our contractual obligation to the policyholders, changes in and deviations from economic, mortality, morbidity, and withdrawal assumptions used in the calculation of these reserves will not directly affect our results of operations unless there is a default by the assuming reinsurer.
valuation of investments in determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are primarily based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. when such unadjusted quoted prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs. if these observable inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of investments. the methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. our ability to sell investments and the price ultimately realized for investments depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market.
see also notes 2, 8 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, "item 1a - risk factors - financial risks - our investment portfolio is subject to credit, liquidity and other risks that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition" and " - investments" contained in this item 7.
valuation and recoverability of goodwill our goodwill related to acquisitions of businesses was $2.61 billion and $2.60 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we review our goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. such indicators include: a significant adverse change in legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel or a significant decline in our expected future cash flows due to changes in company-specific factors or the broader business climate. the evaluation of such factors requires considerable management judgment. any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is either at the operating segment or one level below, if that component is a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews such information. components within an operating segment can be aggregated into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. a goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value, including goodwill, of the reporting unit over its fair value. an impairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
our global lifestyle operating segment is disaggregated into two reporting units: connected living and global automotive. our reporting unit for goodwill testing was at the same level as the operating segment for global housing.
the following table illustrates the amount of goodwill carried by operating segment as of the dates indicated:

total                         $2,608.8                      $2,603.0
(1)as of december 31, 2023, $785.2 million and $1,506.9 million of goodwill was assigned to the connected living and global automotive reporting units, respectively. as of december 31, 2022, $761.0 million and $1,432.9 million of goodwill was assigned to the connected living (including global financial services which was aggregated with connected living in 2023) and global automotive reporting units, respectively.
quantitative impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative assessment for the global lifestyle and global housing reporting units given the uncertainty in macro-economic conditions and inflation concerns. based on this quantitative assessment, the company determined that it was more likely than not that the reporting units' fair values were more than their carrying amounts and that there was no impairment for the global lifestyle and global housing reporting units as of october 1, 2023.
the determination of fair value of the reporting units requires many estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions include earnings and required capital projections discussed above, discount rates, terminal growth rates, operating income and dividend forecasts for each reporting unit and the weighting assigned to the results of each valuation method included in the fair value calculation. changes in certain assumptions could have a significant impact on the goodwill impairment assessment.
should the operating results of these reporting units decline substantially compared to projected results, or should further interest rate declines increase the net unrealized investment portfolio gain position, we could determine that we need to perform an updated impairment test due to the potential impairment indicators, which may require the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in any of the reporting units.
for the fourth quarter of 2023 quantitative assessment, had the net book value for the reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value, the company would have recognized a goodwill impairment loss for the difference up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022
net income consolidated net income increased $365.9 million, or 132%, to $642.5 million for twelve months 2023 from $276.6 million for twelve months 2022, primarily driven by higher lender-placed net earned premiums and lower non-catastrophe loss experience in our homeowners business within global housing, a $104.3 million decrease in after-tax net unrealized losses from changes in the fair value of equity securities and $47.6 million of lower after-tax reportable catastrophes. also contributing to the increase was a $24.7 million after-tax decline in losses related to our non-core operations and a $14.7 million reduction in after-tax restructuring costs related to our previously announced restructuring plan. the increase in net income was partially offset by higher after-tax depreciation expenses of $18.2 million, mainly due to higher software assets placed into service, lower earnings from global lifestyle, mainly due to ongoing elevated claims in global automotive, and $12.7 million of higher losses from foreign exchange from the remeasurement of net monetary assets in argentina, due to the country's classification as a highly inflationary economy.

adjusted ebitda decreased $17.1 million, or 2%, to $792.3 million for twelve months 2023 from $809.4 million for twelve months 2022, primarily due to ongoing elevated claims costs in global automotive, including higher labor and parts costs due to inflation and unfavorable loss experience in select ancillary products, lower mobile results in asia pacific, including the impact of foreign exchange, and lower profitability in extended service contracts. the decline was partially offset by higher net investment income across global lifestyle and stronger mobile device protection results in north america.
total revenues increased $593.4 million, or 7%, to $8.91 billion for twelve months 2023 from $8.32 billion for twelve months 2022. net earned premiums increased $410.3 million, or 6%, primarily driven by continued domestic organic growth from prior period sales in our global automotive business across all distribution channels. net earned premium from connected living increased modestly, mainly from organic growth across all products, partially offset by the impact of a previously disclosed mobile program contract change that resulted in lower retention of premiums net of reinsurance, as well as the run-off of certain global mobile programs. net investment income increased $93.9 million, or 37%, primarily due to higher yields on cash, short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. fees and other income increased $89.2 million, or 8%, mainly driven by higher average selling prices on mobile trade-in programs, as well as contributions from new programs, partially offset by a mobile program contract change related to our in-store mobile service and repair business.

adjusted ebitda increased $328.2 million, or 133%, to $574.2 million for twelve months 2023 from $246.0 million for twelve months 2022, mainly due to growth in homeowners from higher lender-placed average insured values, policies in force and premium rates; a $60.4 million decrease in reportable catastrophes; lower non-catastrophe loss experience, including $54.1 million of favorable reserve development in twelve months 2023 compared to $15.5 million of adverse reserve development in twelve months 2022; and higher net investment income. the increase was partially offset by exits from certain international markets and higher catastrophe reinsurance costs primarily from restructuring the program.

total benefits, losses and expenses decreased $36.0 million, or 2%, to $1.68 billion for twelve months 2023 from $1.71 billion for twelve months 2022. policyholder benefits decreased $22.1 million, or 2%, primarily due to lower reportable catastrophe losses and favorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve development, partially offset by higher current year non-catastrophe loss experience from business growth and higher severity. underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $13.9 million, or 2%, primarily due to exits from certain international markets, higher reimbursements related to the national flood insurance program for processing flood claims for hurricane ian and a discretionary benefit from the federal emergency management agency.

adjusted ebitda was $(109.0) million for twelve months 2023 compared to $(99.2) million for twelve months 2022. the increase in the loss was primarily due to lower net investment income, mostly due to lower invested assets from the use of the global preneed sale proceeds in twelve months 2022 for share repurchases, and higher employee-related expenses.
total revenues decreased $5.8 million, or 21%, to $21.6 million for twelve months 2023 from $27.4 million for twelve months 2022, primarily driven by a decrease in net investment income of $5.5 million, or 20%, mostly due to lower invested assets from the use of the global preneed sale proceeds in twelve months 2022 for share repurchases, partially offset by higher cash yields.
total benefits, losses and expenses increased $4.0 million, or 3%, to $130.6 million for twelve months 2023 from $126.6 million for twelve months 2022, primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses of $4.4 million, or 3%, primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, partially offset by the reduction of expenses from a subsidiary that was sold in second quarter 2022.
investments we had total investments of $8.22 billion and $7.52 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. net unrealized losses on our fixed maturity securities portfolio decreased $256.8 million during twelve months 2023, from a $637.1 million unrealized loss at december 31, 2022 to a $380.3 million unrealized loss at december 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in treasury yields.

net investment income increased $125.0 million, or 34%, to $489.1 million for twelve months 2023 from $364.1 million for twelve months 2022. the increase was primarily driven by higher yields and assets in fixed maturity securities, short term investments and cash and cash equivalents.
net realized losses on investments and fair value changes to equity securities were $68.7 million for twelve months 2023 compared to net realized losses on investments and fair value changes to equity securities of $179.7 million for twelve months 2022. the change in twelve months 2023 was primarily driven by changes in the fair value of equity securities and lower sales of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by a decrease in realized gains on sales of equity securities.
as of december 31, 2023, we owned $17.8 million of securities guaranteed by financial guarantee insurance companies. included in this amount was $16.0 million of municipal securities, whose credit rating was a+ with the guarantee, but would have had a rating of aa- without the guarantee.

liquidity and capital resources the following section discusses our ability to generate cash flows from each of our subsidiaries, borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet our operating and growth needs. management believes that we will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our needs over the next twelve months, including the ability to pay interest on our debt and dividends on our common stock.
during third quarter 2023, we submitted an agreement to sell our miami, florida office (the "agreement") to a potential acquiror, which is subject to review, approval, execution and other conditions. if the transaction is consummated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we expect to record a gain in 2024 above the current carrying value of $46.0 million as of december 31, 2023. we do not anticipate that the gain will impact our capital deployment priorities. the entry into a definitive agreement and the consummation of the transaction are subject to significant uncertainty. there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be executed or that any transaction will be approved or consummated.
regulatory requirements assurant, inc. is a holding company and, as such, has limited direct operations of its own. our assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. accordingly, our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as payments under our tax allocation agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries. our subsidiaries' ability to pay such dividends and make such other payments is regulated by the states and territories in which our subsidiaries are domiciled. these dividend regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary, but generally require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends they can pay to the holding company. see "item 1a - risk factors - legal and regulatory risks - changes in insurance regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth." along with solvency regulations, the primary driver in determining the amount of capital used for dividends from insurance subsidiaries is the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from a.m. best. for the year ending december 31, 2024, the maximum amount of dividends our regulated u.s. domiciled insurance subsidiaries could pay us, under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval, is approximately $592.4 million. our international and non-insurance subsidiaries provide additional sources of dividends.
regulators or rating agencies could become more conservative in their methodology and criteria, increasing capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries or the enterprise.
in september 2023, the following actions were taken by a.m. best:
•upgraded the insurance financial strength ratings on our insurance operating subsidiaries, american bankers insurance company of florida, american security insurance company, caribbean american property insurance company, voyager indemnity insurance company, virginia surety company, inc, and reliable lloyds insurance company, to a+ from a with a stable outlook.
•upgraded our short-term issuer credit ratings on commercial paper to amb-1+ from amb-1 with a stable outlook.
•upgraded our long-term issuer credit ratings on senior unsecured debt to a- from bbb+ with a stable outlook.
•upgraded our long-term issuer credit ratings on subordinated debt to bbb+ from bbb with a stable outlook.
for further information on our ratings and the risks of ratings downgrades, see "item 1 - business - ratings" and "item 1a - risk factors - financial risks - a decline in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition."
holding company as of december 31, 2023, we had approximately $606.1 million in holding company liquidity, $381.1 million above our targeted minimum level of $225.0 million. the target minimum level of holding company liquidity, which can be used for unforeseen capital needs at our subsidiaries or liquidity needs at the holding company, is calibrated based on approximately one year of pre-tax corporate operating losses and interest expenses. we use the term "holding company liquidity" to represent the portion of cash and other liquid marketable securities held at assurant, inc. (out of a total of $690.0 million as of december 31, 2023) which we are not otherwise holding for a specific purpose as of the balance sheet date. we can use such assets for stock repurchases, stockholder dividends, acquisitions and other corporate purposes.
dividends or returns of capital paid by our subsidiaries, net of infusions of liquid assets and excluding amounts used for or as a result of acquisitions or received from dispositions, were $772.6 million and $549.5 million for twelve months 2023 and twelve months 2022, respectively. we use these cash inflows primarily to pay holding company operating expenses, to make interest payments on indebtedness, to make dividend payments to our common stockholders, to fund investments and acquisitions, and to repurchase our common stock. from time to time, we may also seek to purchase outstanding debt in open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions.
dividends and repurchases during twelve months 2023 and twelve months 2022, we made common stock repurchases and paid dividends to our common stockholders of $352.3 million and $717.8 million, respectively.
on january 18, 2024, the board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.72 per common share payable on march 25, 2024 to stockholders of record as of february 5, 2024. we paid dividends of $0.72 per common share on december 18, 2023 to stockholders of record as of november 27, 2023. this represented a 3% increase to the quarterly dividend of $0.70 per common share paid on september 18, june 20, and march 20, 2023.
any determination to pay future dividends will be at the discretion of the board and will be dependent upon various factors, including: our subsidiaries' payments of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments to us; our results of operations and cash flows; our financial condition and capital requirements; general business conditions and growth prospects; any legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends; and any other factors the board deems relevant. the credit facility (as defined below) also contains limitations on our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and repurchase capital stock if we are in default, or such dividend payments or repurchases would cause us to be in default, of our obligations thereunder. in addition, if we elect to defer the payment of interest on our 7.00% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due march 2048 or our 5.25% subordinated notes due january 2061 (refer to "- senior and subordinated notes" below), we generally may not make payments on or repurchase any shares of our capital stock.
during twelve months 2023, we repurchased 1,319,204 shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $200.0 million, exclusive of commissions. in may 2021, the board authorized a share repurchase program for up to $900.0 million of our outstanding common stock. in november 2023, the board authorized an additional share repurchase program for up to $600.0 million of our outstanding common stock. as of december 31, 2023, $674.5 million aggregate cost at purchase remained unused under the repurchase authorizations. the timing and the amount of future repurchases will depend on various factors, including those listed above.
assurant subsidiaries the primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of premiums and fees collected, proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and net investment income. cash is primarily used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating expenses and taxes. we generally invest our subsidiaries' funds in order to generate investment income.
we conduct periodic asset liability studies to measure the duration of our insurance liabilities, to develop optimal asset portfolio maturity structures for our significant lines of business and ultimately to assess that cash flows are sufficient to meet the timing of cash needs. these studies are conducted in accordance with formal company-wide asset liability management guidelines.
to complete a study for a particular line of business, models are developed to project asset and liability cash flows and balance sheet items under a varied set of plausible economic scenarios. these models consider many factors including the current investment portfolio, the required capital for the related assets and liabilities, our tax position and projected cash flows from both existing and projected new business. for risks related to modeling, see "item 1a - risk factors - financial risks -actual results may differ materially from the analytical models we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management."
alternative asset portfolio asset allocations are analyzed for significant lines of business. an investment portfolio maturity structure is then selected from these profiles given our return hurdle and risk appetite. scenario testing of significant liability assumptions and new business projections is also performed.
our liabilities generally do not include policyholder optionality, which means that the timing of payments is generally insensitive to the interest rate environment. in addition, our investment portfolio is largely comprised of highly liquid public fixed maturity securities with a sufficient component of such securities invested that are near maturity which may be sold with minimal risk of loss to meet cash needs.
generally, our subsidiaries' premiums, fees and investment income, along with planned asset sales and maturities, provide sufficient cash to pay claims and expenses. however, there may be instances when unexpected cash needs arise in excess of that available from usual operating sources. in such instances, we have several options to raise needed funds, including selling assets from the subsidiaries' investment portfolios, using holding company cash (if available), issuing commercial paper, or drawing funds from the credit facility.

2026 senior notes: in february 2023, we issued senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $175.0 million, which bear interest at a rate of 6.10% per year, mature in february 2026 and were issued at a 0.035% discount to the public (the "2026 senior notes"). interest on the 2026 senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on february 27 and august 27 of each year, beginning on august 27, 2023. prior to january 27, 2026, we may redeem all or part of the 2026 senior notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the 2026 senior notes to be redeemed, plus a make-whole premium as described in the 2026 senior notes and accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date. on or after that date, we may redeem all or part of the 2026 senior notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the 2026 senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date.
in march 2023, we used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2026 senior notes (and available cash on hand) to redeem $175.0 million of the $225.0 million then outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 4.20% senior notes due september 2023 (the "2023 senior notes") plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date. in connection with the redemption, we recognized a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.1 million. the net gain resulted from the recognition of a previously deferred gain from the termination of a hedge of the interest rate risk associated with the redeemed notes, partially offset by the immediate recognition of the remaining deferred debt issuance costs relating to the redeemed notes.
in september 2023, the remaining $50.0 million outstanding principal amount of the 2023 senior notes was paid upon maturity.
in the next five years, we have two debt maturities in february 2026 and march 2028 when the 2026 senior notes and the 2028 senior notes, respectively, become due and payable.
credit facility and commercial paper program we have a $500.0 million five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") with a syndicate of banks arranged by jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and wells fargo bank, national association. the credit facility provides for revolving loans and the issuance of multi-bank, syndicated letters of credit and letters of credit from a sole issuing bank in an aggregate amount of $500.0 million, which may be increased up to $700.0 million. the credit facility is available until december 2026, provided we are in compliance with all covenants. the credit facility has a sublimit for letters of credit issued thereunder of $50.0 million. the proceeds from these loans may be used for our commercial paper program or for general corporate purposes.
we made no borrowings using the credit facility during twelve months 2023 and no loans were outstanding as of december 31, 2023.
our commercial paper program requires us to maintain liquidity facilities either in an available amount equal to any outstanding notes from the program or in an amount sufficient to maintain the ratings assigned to the notes issued from the program. our commercial paper is rated amb-1+ by a.m. best, p-2 by moody's and a-2 by s&p. our subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities. this program is currently backed up by the credit facility, of which $500.0 million was available as of december 31, 2023.
we did not use the commercial paper program during twelve months 2023 and there were no amounts relating to the commercial paper program outstanding as of december 31, 2023.
for additional information, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
letters of credit letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business. these letters of credit are supported by commitments under which we are required to indemnify the financial institution issuing the letter of credit if the letter of credit is drawn. we had $2.9 million and $2.7 million of letters of credit outstanding as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
cash flows we monitor cash flows at the consolidated, holding company and subsidiary levels. cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and subsidiary levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs making adjustments to the forecasts when needed.

cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022
operating activities we typically generate operating cash inflows from premiums collected from our insurance products, fees received for services and income received from our investments while outflows consist of policy acquisition costs, benefits paid and operating expenses. these net cash flows are then invested to support the obligations of our insurance products and required capital supporting these products. our cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums, fees, and investment income received and expenses paid.
net cash provided by operating activities was $1.14 billion and $596.9 million for twelve months 2023 and twelve months 2022, respectively. the change in net operating cash flows was largely attributable to our mobile business operations, primarily from higher collections of premiums and fees due to timing, and a decrease in payments to vendors for acquisition of mobile devices used to meet insurance claims or generate profits through sales to third parties. the increase was partially offset by higher net paid claims for twelve months 2023 and a receipt of a tax refund that was in excess of tax payments during twelve months 2022.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $637.7 million and $262.1 million for twelve months 2023 and twelve months 2022, respectively. the change in net investing cash flows was primarily driven by the investment of net cash provided by operating activities and reinvestment of proceeds from the sales of maturities of investments in higher yielding fixed maturity securities during the period. also contributing to the change was an increase in purchases of short-term investments due to the timing of working capital needs.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $403.9 million and $818.4 million for twelve months 2023 and twelve months 2022, respectively. the change in net financing cash flows was primarily due to lower share repurchases during twelve months 2023.

(1)insurance liabilities reflect undiscounted estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders, net of expected future premium cash receipts on in-force policies and excluding fully reinsured runoff operations. the total gross reserve for fully reinsured runoff operations that was excluded was $597.9 million which, if the reinsurers defaulted, would be payable over a 30+ year period with the majority of the payments occurring after 5 years. additional information on the reinsurance arrangements can be found in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. these liabilities also do not include recoverable amounts related to certain high deductible policies in our sharing economy business, included in our non-core operations, for which we are responsible for paying the entirety of the claim and are subsequently reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim. as of december 31, 2023, we had exposure to $369.5 million of reserves below the deductible that we would be responsible for if the clients were to default on their contractual obligation to pay us the deductible. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on our evaluation of the credit risk exposure from these recoverables. as a result, the amounts presented in this table do not agree to the future policy benefits and expenses and claims and benefits payable in the consolidated balance sheets.
(2)our pension obligations and postretirement benefits include an assurant pension plan, various non-qualified pension plans (including an executive pension plan) and certain life and health care benefits for retired employees and their dependents ("retirement health benefits"), all of which were frozen in 2016. in february 2020, we amended the retirement health benefits to terminate such plan benefits to retirees effective december 31, 2024. due to the assurant pension plan's current overfunded status, no contributions were made during 2023 and none are expected to be made in 2024. see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information.
liabilities for future policy benefits and expenses have been included in the commitments and contingencies table. significant uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency, investment returns, inflation, contract terms and the timing of payments.

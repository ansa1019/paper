item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
introduction the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report. in addition, please see "information regarding non-gaap measures and other" beginning on page 38 for a reconciliation of the non-gaap measures for adjusted total revenues, organic commission, fee and supplemental revenues and adjusted ebitdac to the comparable gaap measures, as well as other important information regarding these measures.
we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage, reinsurance brokerage, consulting services, and third-party property/casualty claims settlement and administration services to entities and individuals around the world. we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients. our brokers, agents and administrators act as intermediaries between underwriting enterprises and our clients and we do not assume net underwriting risks. we are headquartered in rolling meadows, illinois, and provide brokerage, risk management and consulting services in approximately 130 countries around the world through our owned operations and a network of correspondent brokers and consultants. in 2023, we expanded, and expect to continue to expand, our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth. we generate approximately 64% of our revenues for the combined brokerage and risk management segments domestically, with the remaining 36% generated internationally, primarily in the australia, canada, new zealand and the u.k. (based on 2023 revenues). we have three reportable segments: brokerage, risk management and corporate. brokerage and risk management contributed approximately 86% and 14%, respectively, to 2023 revenues. the corporate segment generated revenues from our clean energy investments until 2022, during which we ran-off existing chemical supplies as part of the wind down of such investments' operations, after our ability to generate additional tax credits from qualified refined coal pursuant to irc section 45 ended in december 2021. our major sources of operating revenues are commissions, fees and supplemental and contingent revenues from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations. investment income is generated from invested cash and fiduciary funds, clean energy investments (prior to 2022), and revenue from premium financing.

insurance market overview fluctuations in premiums charged by property/casualty underwriting enterprises have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry. commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels. insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. various factors, including competition for market share among underwriting enterprises, increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations, can result in flat or reduced property/casualty premium rates (a "soft" market). a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues. various countervailing factors, such as greater than anticipated loss experience, unexpected loss exposure and capital shortages, can result in increasing property/casualty premium rates (a "hard" market). a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues. hard and soft markets may be broad-based or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas. as markets harden, buyers of insurance (such as our brokerage clients), have historically tried to mitigate premium increases and the higher commissions these premiums generate, including by raising their deductibles and/or reducing the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase. as the market softens, or costs decrease, these trends have historically reversed. during a hard market, buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks, or may consider the alternative insurance market, which includes self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk. our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well. while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us, such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management, claims management, captive insurance and self-insurance services and related growth in fee revenue. inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures, resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions. however, the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates, and therefore on our revenues, than inflationary pressures.
we use the council of insurance agents & brokers (which we refer to as the ciab) insurance pricing quarterly survey as an indicator of the insurance rate environment. the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers, who write approximately 85% of the commercial property/casualty premiums in the u.s. the fourth quarter 2023 survey had not been published as of the filing date of this report. the first three 2023 quarterly surveys indicated that u.s. commercial property/casualty rates increased by 8.8%, 8.9%, and 8.1% on average, for the first, second and third quarters of 2023, respectively. we expect a similar trend to be noted when the ciab fourth quarter 2023 survey report is issued, which would indicate overall continued price firming and hardening in most lines of business.
we believe increases in property/casualty rates will continue throughout 2024 due to rising loss costs, a hard reinsurance market, increased frequency of catastrophe losses and social inflation. if loss trends deteriorate over the coming quarters, including due to the impact of natural catastrophes, it could lead to a more difficult rate and conditions environment in certain lines. the combination of increasing insurable values (due in large part to inflation, including wage inflation), a tight labor market and lower unemployment is likely contributing to increases in client insured exposures. additionally, we expect that our history of strong new business generation, solid retentions and enhanced value-added services for our carrier partners should all result in further organic growth opportunities around the world. overall, we believe that in a positive rate environment with increasing exposures, our professionals can demonstrate their expertise and high-quality, value-added capabilities by strengthening our clients' insurance portfolios and delivering insurance and risk management solutions within our clients' budget. based on our experience, there is currently adequate capacity in the insurance and reinsurance market for most lines of coverage.
clean energy investments - we have investments in limited liability companies that own or have owned 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and six clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party. all 35 plants produced refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chem-mod. we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants prior to 2022 was qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45. the plants which were placed in service prior to december 31, 2009 (which we refer to as the 2009 era plants) received tax credits through 2019 and the 21 plants which were placed in service prior to december 31, 2011 (which we refer to as the 2011 era plants) received tax credits through 2021. all twenty-one of the 2011 era plants were under long‐term production contracts with several utilities. those agreements ended december 31, 2021 due to the expiration of the irc section 45 program.
we also own a 46.5% controlling interest in chem-mod, which prior to 2022 marketed the chem‐mod solution proprietary technologies principally to refined fuel plants that sell refined fuel to coal-fired power plants owned by utility companies, including those plants in which we hold interests. chem-mod has not generated after-tax earnings since 2021.
business combinations and dispositions see note 3 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our 2023 business combinations.
results of operations information regarding non-gaap measures and other in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows, in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap, we provide information regarding ebitdac, ebitdac margin, adjusted ebitdac, adjusted ebitdac margin, diluted net earnings per share, as adjusted (adjusted eps), adjusted revenue, adjusted compensation and operating expenses, adjusted compensation expense ratio, adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue. these measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, the gaap information provided in this report. we believe that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition or because they provide investors with measures that our chief operating decision maker uses when reviewing the company's performance. see further below for definitions and additional reasons each of these measures is useful to investors. our industry peers may provide similar supplemental non-gaap information with respect to one or more of these measures, although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments. for example, our organic revenue is calculated differently than some of our industry peers. the non-gaap information we provide should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the gaap information provided. we make determinations regarding certain elements of executive officer incentive compensation, performance share awards and annual cash incentive awards, partly on the basis of measures related to adjusted ebitdac.
adjusted non-gaap presentation - we believe that the adjusted non-gaap presentation of our 2023 and 2022 information, presented on the following pages, provides stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics that may assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us. the after-tax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period.
•adjusted measures - we define these measures as revenues (for the brokerage segment), revenues before reimbursements (for the risk management segment), net earnings, compensation expense and operating expense, respectively, each adjusted to exclude the following, as applicable:
onet gains on divestitures, which are primarily net proceeds received related to sales of books of business and other divestiture transactions, such as the disposal of a business through sale or closure.
oacquisition integration costs, which include costs related to certain large acquisitions (including willis re, the acquisition of buck and the acquisitions of cadence insurance, eastern insurance and my plan manager), outside the scope of our usual tuck-in strategy, not expected to occur on an ongoing basis in the future once we fully assimilate the applicable acquisition. these costs are typically associated with redundant workforce, compensation expense related to amortization of certain retention bonus arrangements, extra lease space, duplicate services and external costs incurred to assimilate the acquisition into our it related systems.
otransaction-related costs, which primarily are associated with the acquisition of willis re (primarily related to deferred closings in certain jurisdictions in 2022), the acquisition of buck and the acquisitions of cadence insurance, eastern insurance and my plan manager. these include costs related to regulatory filings, legal and accounting services, insurance and incentive compensation.
oworkforce related charges, which primarily include severance costs (either accrued or paid) related to employee terminations and other costs associated with redundant workforce.
olease termination related charges, which primarily include costs related to terminations of real estate leases and abandonment of leased space.
oacquisition related adjustments, which include the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables adjustments and acquisition related compensation charges.
oamortization of intangible assets which reflects the amortization of customer/expiration lists, non-compete agreements, trade names and other intangible assets acquired through our merger and acquisition strategy, the impact to amortization expense of acquisition valuation adjustments to these assets as well as non-cash impairment charges.
othe impact of foreign currency translation, as applicable. the amounts excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by applying current year foreign exchange rates to the same period in the prior year.
oeffective income tax rate impact, which levelizes the prior year for the change in current year tax rates.
oclean energy related, which represents the resolution of various partnership matters related to our clean energy investments.
olegal and tax related, which represents the impact of (a) adjustments in fourth quarter 2023 related to costs associated with legal and tax matters as well as the impact of tax items associated with 2022 tax returns filed in october 2023, (b) adjustments in second quarter of 2023 related to additional u.k. income tax expense related to the non‐deductibility of acquisition-related adjustments made in the quarter and costs associated with legal and tax matters, (c) adjustments in second quarter 2022 related to a one-time u.s. state tax benefit that resulted from legal entity restructuring and a favorable u.k. tax impact related to earnout liability adjustments, and (d) adjustments in first quarter 2022 related to a one-time benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets associated with increasing our u.s. state effective income tax rate.
•adjusted ratios - adjusted compensation expense and adjusted operating expense, respectively, each divided by adjusted revenues.
non-gaap earnings measures we believe that the presentation of ebitdac, ebitdac margin, adjusted ebitdac, adjusted ebitdac margin, adjusted eps and adjusted net earnings for the brokerage and risk management segment, each as defined below, provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance. adjusted eps is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of our liquidity. we also consider ebitdac and ebitdac margin as ways to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis. in addition, adjusted ebitdac, adjusted ebitdac margin and adjusted eps for the brokerage and risk management segments are presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability.
•ebitdac and ebitdac margin - ebitdac is net earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables and ebitdac margin is ebitdac divided by total revenues (for the brokerage segment) and revenues before reimbursements (for the risk management segment). these measures for the brokerage and risk management segments provide a meaningful representation of our operating performance for the overall business and provide a meaningful way to measure our financial performance on an ongoing basis.
•adjusted ebitdac and adjusted ebitdac margin - adjusted ebitdac is ebitdac adjusted to exclude net gains on divestitures, acquisition integration costs, workforce related charges, lease termination related charges, acquisition related adjustments, transaction related costs, legal and tax related costs, and the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation, as applicable and adjusted ebitdac margin is adjusted ebitdac divided by total adjusted revenues (defined above). these measures for the brokerage and risk management segments provide a meaningful representation of our operating performance, and are also presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability.
•adjusted eps and adjusted net earnings - adjusted net earnings have been adjusted to exclude the after-tax impact of net gains on divestitures, acquisition integration costs, the impact of foreign currency translation, workforce related charges, lease termination related charges, acquisition related adjustments, transaction related costs, amortization of intangible assets, legal and tax related costs and effective income tax rate impact, as applicable. adjusted eps is adjusted net earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. this measure provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance (and as such should not be used as a measure of our liquidity), and for the overall business is also presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability.
organic revenues (a non-gaap measure) - for the brokerage segment, organic change in base commission and fee revenues, supplemental revenues and contingent revenues excludes the first twelve months of such revenues generated from acquisitions and such revenues related to divested operations in each year presented. these revenues are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year. in addition, organic change in base commission and fee revenues, supplemental revenues and contingent revenues exclude the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods. for the risk management segment, organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of such revenues generated from acquisitions and such revenues related to divested operations in each year presented. in addition, change in organic growth in fee revenues excludes the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods.
these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable, but non-gaap, measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in the current year and beyond as well as eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability. we have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments. we also believe that using this non-gaap measure allows readers of our financial statements to measure, analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner.
reconciliation of non-gaap information presented to gaap measures - this report includes tabular reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures, as follows: for ebitdac (on pages 42 and 48), for adjusted revenues, adjusted ebitdac and adjusted diluted net earnings per share (on page 35), for organic revenue measures (on pages 43 and 48), respectively, for the brokerage and risk management segments, for adjusted compensation and operating expenses and adjusted ebitdac margin (on page 45), respectively, for the brokerage segment and (on page 49) for the risk management segment.
brokerage the brokerage segment accounted for 86% of our revenue in 2023. our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail, wholesale and gallagher re. our brokerage segment generates revenues by:
(i)identifying, negotiating and placing all forms of insurance or coverage, as well as providing data analytics, risk-shifting, risk-sharing and risk-mitigation consulting services, principally related to property/casualty, life, health, welfare and disability insurance. we also provide these services through, or in conjunction with, other unrelated agents and brokers, consultants and management advisors;
(ii)identifying, negotiating and placing all forms of reinsurance coverage, as well as providing capital markets services, including acting as underwriter, with respect to insurance linked securities, weather derivatives, capital raising and selected merger and acquisition advisory activities;
(iii)acting as an agent or broker for multiple underwriting enterprises by providing services such as sales, marketing, selecting, negotiating, underwriting, servicing and placing insurance coverage on their behalf;
40
(iv)providing consulting services related to health and welfare benefits, voluntary benefits, executive benefits, compensation, retirement planning, institutional investment and fiduciary, actuarial, compliance, private insurance exchange, human resource technology, communications and benefits administration; and
(v)providing management and administrative services to captives, pools, risk-retention groups, healthcare exchanges, small underwriting enterprises, such as accounting, claims and loss processing assistance, feasibility studies, actuarial studies, data analytics and other administrative services.
the primary source of revenues for our brokerage services is commissions from underwriting enterprises, based on a percentage of premiums paid by our clients, or fees received from clients based on an agreed level of service usually in lieu of commissions. commissions are fixed at the contract effective date and generally are based on a percentage of premiums for insurance coverage or employee headcount for employer sponsored benefit plans. commissions depend upon a large number of factors, including the type of risk being placed, the particular underwriting enterprise's demand, the expected loss experience of the particular risk of coverage, and historical benchmarks surrounding the level of effort necessary for us to place and service the insurance contract. rather than being tied to the amount of premiums, fees are most often based on an expected level of effort to provide our services. in addition, under certain circumstances, both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent revenues. supplemental revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise that is above the base commission paid, is determined by the underwriting enterprise and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria. contingent revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise based on the overall profit and/or volume of the business placed with that underwriting enterprise during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period.

commissions and fees - the aggregate increase in base commissions and fees for 2023 was due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2023 and 2022 ($531.8 million) and organic revenue growth. commission revenues increased 13% and fee revenues increased 28% in 2023 compared to 2022, respectively. the organic change in base commission and fee revenues was 9% in 2023 and 2022.
in our property/casualty brokerage operations, during the twelve-month period ended december 31, 2023, we saw continued strong customer retention and new business generation and increasing renewal premiums (premium rates and exposures). we believe these favorable trends should continue in 2024; however, if economic conditions worsen or premium rate increases slow, we could see our revenue growth soften.

the $232.4 million increase in operating expense in 2023 compared to 2022, was primarily due to expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in the twelve-month period ended december 31, 2023 - $91.2 million, acquisition integration costs - $36.6 million, and an increase of $104.6 million in the aggregate from the return of, and underlying inflation of, advertising, travel, entertainment and other client-related expenses, professional fees, business insurance and additional investments in technology.
depreciation - the increase in depreciation expense in 2023 compared to 2022 was due primarily to the impact of purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements related to office consolidations and moves, and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems. also contributing to the increases in depreciation expense in 2023 was the depreciation expense associated with acquisitions completed in 2023.
amortization - the increase in amortization in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the impact of amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed in 2023 and 2022, partially offset by the impact of acquisition valuation true-ups recorded in 2023 relating to acquisitions made in 2022. expiration lists, non‐compete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives (two to fifteen years for expiration lists, two to six years for non-compete agreements and two to fifteen years for trade names). based on the results of impairment reviews performed on amortizable intangible assets in 2023 and 2022, we wrote off $3.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively, of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment. we review all of our intangible assets for impairment periodically (at least annually for goodwill) and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. we perform such impairment reviews at the division (i.e., reporting unit) level with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible assets. in reviewing intangible assets, if the undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the respective (or underlying) asset, an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings as a component of amortization expense. we performed a qualitative impairment review on carrying value of our goodwill for all of our reporting units as of december 31, 2023 and no indicators of impairment were noted.
change in estimated acquisition earnout payables - the change in the expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2023 compared to 2022 was due primarily to adjustments made to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised assumptions due to rising interest rates and increased market volatility and projections of future performance. during 2023 and 2022, we recognized $76.1 million and $60.2 million, respectively, of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our acquisitions made from 2020 to 2023. during 2023 and 2022, we recognized $300.7 million and $30.2 million of expense, respectively, related to net adjustments in the estimated fair market values of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 80 and 86 acquisitions, respectively. the net adjustments in 2023, primarily include changes made to the estimated fair value of the willis re acquisition earnout and reflect updated assumptions as of december 31, 2023, including forecasted 2024 revenue projections based on january 1, 2024 reinsurance renewals.
the amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our 2020 to 2023 acquisitions were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two- to three‐year period subsequent to the acquisition date. the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements. in determining fair value, we estimate the acquired entity's future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth and/or profitability. we estimate future earnout payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections. subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred. increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income.
provision for income taxes - the brokerage segment's effective tax rate in 2023 and 2022 was 25.6% and 24.7%, respectively. as of april 1, 2023, a u.k. corporate tax rate of 25% went into effect making the full year effective rate in the u.k. 23.5%. in the first quarter of 2022, we increased our state effective income tax rate, which resulted in the overall u.s. effective income tax rate increasing from 25% to 26% and caused us to incur additional income tax expense. we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5% to 26.5% in our brokerage segment based on known changes in tax rates in future periods.
net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests - the amounts reported in this line for 2023 and 2022 include noncontrolling interest earnings of $6.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively.
litigation, regulatory and taxation matters - we routinely are involved in legal proceedings, claims, disputes, regulatory matters and governmental inspections or investigations arising in the ordinary course of or incidental to our business, including relating to e&o claims and those noted below in this section. we record accruals in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. for the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies, unless disclosed below. we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. however, legal proceedings and government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur, including the payment of substantial monetary damages or an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices or requiring other remedies, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial position.
during 2022, we received a subpoena from the fcpa unit of the doj seeking information related to our insurance business with public entities in ecuador. during the fourth quarter of 2023, the doj informed us that it had closed its inquiry and would not be pursuing enforcement action against us in connection with this matter.
as previously disclosed, our irc 831(b) (or "micro-captive") advisory services business has been under audit by the irs since 2013. among other matters, the irs is investigating whether we have been acting as a tax shelter promoter in connection with these operations. additionally, the irs is conducting a criminal investigation related to irc 831(b) micro-captive underwriting enterprises. we have been advised that we are not a target of the criminal investigation. we are fully cooperating with both matters.
risk management the risk management segment accounted for 14% of our revenue in 2023. our risk management segment operations provide contract claim settlement, claim administration, loss control services and risk management consulting for commercial, nonprofit, captive and public sector entities, and various other organizations that choose to self-insure property/casualty coverages or choose to use a third‐party claims management organization rather than the claim services provided by underwriting enterprises. revenues for our risk management segment are comprised of fees generally negotiated (i) on a per-claim or per-service basis, (ii) on a cost-plus basis, or (iii) as performance-based fees. we also provide risk management consulting services that are recognized as the services are delivered.

fees - in 2023, our risk management operations, new core workers' compensation and general liability claims arising improved from new clients coming on board in 2022 and 2023. we believe these favorable trends should continue for 2024, however, worsening economic conditions or a reversal in the number of workers employed, could cause fewer new liability and core workers' compensation claims to arise in future quarters. organic change in fee revenues was 16% in 2023 and 13% in 2022.

on december 6, 2023, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of my plan manager. see note 3 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for information on the purchase price consideration paid to acquire my plan manager. we funded the transaction using free cash flow and borrowings under our credit agreement (see financing cash flow section below). the acquired my plan manager is the leading provider of plan management services to participants in australia's national disability insurance scheme.
reimbursements - reimbursements represent amounts received from clients reimbursing us for certain third-party costs associated with providing our claims management services. in certain service partner relationships, we are considered a principal because we direct the third party, control the specified service and combine the services provided into an integrated solution. given this principal relationship, we are required to recognize revenue on a gross basis and service partner vendor fees in the operating expense line in our consolidated statement of earnings. the increase in reimbursements in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a change in business mix that is processed internally versus using outside service partners.
interest income and other income - interest income and other income primarily represents interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and fiduciary cash. interest income and other income in 2023 increased compared to 2022 primarily due to increases in interest rates earned on fiduciary cash.
compensation expense - the following provides non-gaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2023 and 2022 compensation expense compensation expense (in millions):

adjusted revenues (before reimbursements) - see page 36          $1,287.2              $1,086.8
the $111.9 million increase in compensation expense in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to increased base compensation related to merit wage increases and hiring to support growth, benefits, and other incentive compensation linked to operating results - $110.6 million in the aggregate. also contributing to the increase was compensation associated with the acquisition completed in the twelve month period ended december 31, 2023 - $2.6 million and acquisition integration costs - $0.7 million, partially offset by reduced workforce related charges $2.0 million.
operating expense - the following provides non-gaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2023 and 2022 operating expense operating expense (in millions):
2023                  2022

adjusted revenues - (before reimbursements) see page 36          $1,287.2              $1,086.8
the $23.5 million increase in operating expense in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the return of underlying inflation of, travel, entertainment and other client-related expenses and additional investments in technology - $23.9 million in the aggregate. also contributing to the increase was operating expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in the twelve month period ended december 31, 2023 - $1.1 million, partially offset by reduced acquisition integration - $1.5 million.
depreciation - depreciation expense decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, which reflects the impact of office consolidations that occurred as leases expired in 2023 and 2022 (less depreciation associated with furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements), partially offset by expenditures related to upgrading computer systems.
amortization - amortization expense increased in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase in amortization in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the impact of amortization expense of intangible assets associated with the acquisition completed in 2023. based on the results of impairment reviews performed on amortizable intangible assets during 2023 and 2022, there were no impairments of amortizable assets related to the risk management segment.
change in estimated acquisition earnout payables - the change in expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2023 compared to 2022, were due primarily to adjustments made in 2023 and 2022 to the estimated fair value of an earnout obligation related to revised projections of future performance. during 2023 and 2022, we recognized $0.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our 2020 to 2023 acquisitions, respectively. during 2023, there were no net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to projections of future performance for acquisitions. during 2022, we recognized $8.2 million of income related to net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance for three acquisitions.
provision for income taxes - we allocate the provision for income taxes to the risk management segment using local statutory rates. as of april 1, 2023, a u.k. corporate tax rate of 25% went into effect, making the full year effective rate 23.5%. the risk management segment's effective tax rate in 2023 and 2022 was 26.4% and 26.3%, respectively. in first quarter of 2022, we increased our state effective income tax rate, which resulted in the overall u.s. effective income tax rate increasing from 25% to 26% and caused us to incur additional income tax expense. we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate on adjusted results of approximately 25.0% to 27.0% in our risk management segment based on known changes in tax rates in future periods.
corporate the corporate segment reports the financial information related to our clean energy and other investments, our debt, certain corporate and acquisition-related activities and the impact of foreign currency remeasurement. see note 14 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for a summary discussion of the nature of our investments at december 31, 2023 and 2022. see note 8 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for a summary of our debt at december 31, 2023 and 2022.

revenues - revenues in the corporate segment consist of the following:
•even though the law governing irc section 45 tax credits expired as of december 31, 2021, we did have some production at our clean coal production plants in 2022 to run-off existing chemical supplies.
•the de minimis 2022 revenues from consolidated clean coal production plants represents revenues from the consolidated irc section 45 facilities in which we have a majority ownership position and maintain control over the operations at the related facilities.
•royalty income from clean coal licenses represents revenues related to chem-mod llc. we held a 46.5% controlling interest in chem-mod llc. as chem-mod llc's manager, we are required to consolidate its operations.
•the decrease in royalty income in 2023 compared to 2022 was due to the irc section 45 program expiring as of december 31, 2021.
cost of revenues - cost of revenues from consolidated clean coal production plants in 2022 consists of the cost of coal, labor, equipment maintenance, chemicals, supplies, management fees and depreciation incurred by the clean coal production plants to generate the consolidated revenues discussed above. even though the law governing irc section 45 tax credits expired as of december 31, 2021, we did have some production at our clean coal production plants in 2022 to run-off existing chemical supplies.
compensation expense - compensation expense for 2023 and 2022 includes salary, incentive compensation, and associated benefit expenses of $135.3 million and $110.2 million, respectively. the change in 2023 compensation expense compared to 2022 was primarily due to growth in base compensation and increased incentive compensation, as well as transaction-related costs as described on page 54 in note (2).
operating expense - operating expense for 2023 includes banking and related fees of $3.1 million, external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2023 acquisitions of $33.8 million, which includes $17.6 million of transaction-related costs as described on page 54 in note (2), other corporate and clean energy related expenses, including litigation matters, technology and other professional fees - $113.3 million in aggregate, and a net unrealized foreign exchange remeasurement loss of $9.8 million.
operating expense for 2022 includes banking and related fees of $2.5 million, external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2022 acquisitions of $40.8 million, which includes specific transaction-related costs as described on page 54 in note (2), other corporate and clean energy related expenses of $44.4 million, including legal fees, and costs associated with the idling of the irc section 45 program and a net unrealized foreign exchange remeasurement gain of $30.6 million.
interest expense - the increase in interest expense in 2023 compared to 2022 was due to the following (in millions):
change in interest expense related to:                           2023 / 2022
interest on borrowings from our credit agreement                        $7.3

net change in interest expense                                         $39.8
depreciation - depreciation expense in 2023 increased compared to 2022, due to capital improvements made at our corporate headquarters and gallagher centers of excellence in 2023 and 2022 and to the acquisition of other corporate related fixed assets in 2023.
net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests - the amounts reported in this line for 2023 and 2022 primarily include noncontrolling interest losses of $(9.8) million and $(2.6) million, respectively, related to our investment in chem-mod llc. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, we held a 46.5% controlling interest in chem-mod llc. also, included in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are offsetting amounts related to non-gallagher owned interests in several clean energy investments.
benefit for income taxes - we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments using local statutory rates. the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits expired in december 2021 for 21 of our 2011 era plants. our consolidated effective tax rate was 18.5% and 15.9%, for 2023 and 2022, respectively. the tax rate for 2023 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the income tax benefit of stock-based awards, revaluation of deferred tax assets in bermuda to the new 15% corporate tax rate as well as updates to the u.s. tax attributes associated with the u.k. loss deferral reported on the 2022 tax return. as of april 1, 2023, a u.k. corporate tax rate of 25% went into effect, making the full year effective rate in the u.k. 23.5%. the tax rate for 2022 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the state tax benefits of legal entity restructuring, the revaluation of state deferred tax assets to a higher effective tax rate, as well as the establishment of new deferred tax assets related to u.k. loss deferral. there were no irc section 45 tax credits produced in 2023 and 2022. in 2023, we recognized an unfavorable u.k. tax impact related to earnout liability adjustments. in the first quarter of 2022, we increased our state effective income tax rate, which resulted in the overall u.s. effective income tax rate increasing from 25% to 26%, and caused us to incur additional income tax benefit during the quarter and recognize a one-time benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets. in 2022, we recognized a one-time u.s. state tax benefit that resulted from legal entity restructuring and an unfavorable u.k. tax impact related to earnout liability adjustments. in late 2022, when it became clear the new u.k. prime minister was not going to reverse a previously‐enacted corporate tax rate increase, we recognized a one-time benefit associated with the deferral of u.k. tax losses to a future year. the income tax benefit of stock based awards that vested or were settled in the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was $76.1 million and $59.3 million, respectively.
litigation matters - in july 2019, midwest energy filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of delaware against us, chem‐mod llc and numerous other related and unrelated parties. the complaint alleged that the named defendants infringed patents held exclusively by midwest energy and sought unspecified damages and injunctive relief. during the fourth quarter of 2023, we settled this matter for an amount that was not material and without admitting any wrongdoing.
significant future income tax law changes - on december 27th, 2023, bermuda introduced a new corporate income tax that applies to bermuda businesses that are part of multinational enterprise groups with annual revenues of eur$750.0 million, taking effect in january 2025. we have adjusted our bermuda tax deferred items to account for this rate increase. in 2022, the u.s. enacted the ira and the creating helpful incentives to produce semiconductors (which we refer to as chips) and science act of 2022. we do not anticipate any significant impacts from either law change. see more discussions of those provisions below.
in october 2021, the oecd announced that 136 countries and tax jurisdictions agreed to implement a new pillar 2 approach to international taxation. the first detailed draft rules under that approach were published in december 2021. the u.k. and the majority of the eu have adopted some aspects of these rules. other countries in which we have significant operations, including australia and canada, have announced an intention to adopt it or started the process of doing so. the new approach came into effect in 2023 in certain jurisdictions, and different countries have implemented the necessary rules in different ways, through their individual agreement to tax treaty changes and through changes to their own domestic tax laws. pillar 1 exempts regulated financial institutions and we believe we qualify for such exemption. pillar 2 will establish a global minimum tax rate of 15%, such that multinational enterprises with an effective tax rate in a jurisdiction below this minimum rate will need to pay additional tax, which could be collected by the parent company's tax authorities if that parent country adopts pillar 2 or by those in other countries, depending on whether and how each country implements the oecd's approach in its tax treaties and domestic tax legislation. depending on how the jurisdictions in which we operate, and those in which we and our subsidiaries are based, choose to implement the oecd's approach in their tax treaties and domestic tax laws, particularly if the u.s. does not adopt pillar 2, we could be adversely affected due to our income being taxed at higher effective rates, once these new rules come into force.
u.s. federal income tax law changes items impacting the company going forward alternative minimum tax credit - the ira enacted a book-based corporate alternative minimum tax (which we refer to as camt) for years beginning after 2022. the camt imposes a minimum 15% cash tax on adjusted book income before general business credits. as such, we do not currently anticipate being subject to the camt and even if we were to find ourselves subject to it in a particular year, we do not believe there would be an impact on our earnings.
excise tax on stock buybacks - the ira adds a 1% surtax to corporate stock repurchases effective january 2023. our board approved a common stock repurchase program in 2021. if we were to effectuate stock repurchases under this program, the excise tax would not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. new tax credits for renewable energy - the ira introduced new tax credits for certain renewable energy projects and onshoring certain manufacturing activities associated with those projects. while we continue to explore additional renewable energy investments, we do not currently anticipate significant benefits from these new incentive programs.

(1)pretax losses for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 are presented net of amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $(9.8) million and $(2.6) million, respectively.
(2)we incurred transaction-related costs, which include legal, consulting, employee compensation and other professional fees primarily associated with our acquisition of willis re (primarily related to deferred closings in certain jurisdictions in 2022), the acquisition of buck, which was signed on december 20, 2022 and closed on april 3, 2023, and the acquisitions of cadence insurance, eastern insurance and my plan manager, all of which closed in fourth quarter 2023.
(3)adjustments in fourth quarter 2022 include costs associated with legal and tax matters as well as the impact of tax planning items associated with 2022 tax returns filed in fourth quarter 2023. adjustments in fourth quarter 2022 include (a) additional u.k. income tax expense related to the non‐deductibility of acquisition-related adjustments made in the quarter, (b) gains and costs associated with legal and tax matters, (c) income tax provision adjustments as filed in our 2021 tax returns and (d) income tax benefit related to adjusting certain u.k. deferred income tax assets to the future 25% corporate income tax rate.
(4)corporate pretax loss includes a net unrealized foreign exchange remeasurement loss of $(9.8) million and a net unrealized foreign exchange remeasurement gain of $30.6 million in the year ended december 31, 2022.
interest and banking costs and debt - interest and banking costs includes expenses related to our debt.
clean energy related - for 2023, this consists of operating results related to our investments in new clean energy projects and the wind up of our investment in clean coal production plants. prior to 2023, this consisted of the operating results related to our investments in clean coal production plants and royalty income from clean coal licenses related to chem-mod- llc. the production of irc section 45 clean energy tax credits ceased in december 2021, which reduced the royalty income received by chem-mod llc and net earnings generated by our investments in clean coal production plants in 2022. even though the law governing irc section 45 tax credits expired as of december 31, 2021, we did have some production at our clean coal production plants in the three-month period ended march 31, 2022 to run-off existing chemical supplies.
acquisition costs - consists mostly of external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to acquisitions. on occasion, we enter into forward currency hedges for the purchase price of committed, but not yet funded, acquisitions with funding requirements in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the gains or losses, if any, associated with these hedge transactions are also included.
corporate - consists of overhead allocations mostly related to corporate staff compensation, other corporate level activities, and net unrealized foreign exchange remeasurement. in addition, corporate includes the tax expense related to partial taxation of foreign earnings, nondeductible executive compensation and entertainment expenses, the tax benefit from vesting of employee equity awards, as well as other permanent or discrete tax items not reflected in the provision for income taxes in the brokerage and risk management segments. the income tax benefit of stock based awards that vested or were settled in the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was $76.1 million and $59.3 million, respectively, and is included in the table above in the corporate line.
clean energy investments - we have investments in limited liability companies that own or have owned 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and six clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party. all 35 plants produced refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chem-mod llc. we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants prior to 2022 were qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45. the 14 2009 era plants received tax credits through 2019 and the 21 2011 era plants received tax credits through 2021.
our investment in chem-mod llc prior to 2022 generated royalty income from refined coal production plants owned by those limited liability companies in which we invested as well as refined coal production plants owned by other unrelated parties.
see the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a, "risk factors." for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors could impact the information above. see note 14 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for more information regarding risks and uncertainties related to these investments.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations. the insurance brokerage and risk management industries are not capital intensive. historically, our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock, repurchases of our common stock, funding of our investments, acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures, including investments being made in it and software development projects.
on december 6, 2023, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of my plan manager. see note 3 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for information on the purchase price consideration paid to acquire my plan manager. we funded the transaction using free cash flow and funds received from an unsecured senior notes offering. the acquired my plan manager is the leading provider of plan management services to participants in australia's national disability insurance scheme.
on november 30, 2023, we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of cadence insurance. see note 3 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for information on the purchase price consideration paid to acquire cadence insurance. we funded the transaction using free cash flow and funds received from an unsecured senior notes offering. the acquired cadence insurance business offers a full suite of commercial property/casualty, employee benefits and personal lines products to clients from 34 offices spanning nine states across the southeast, including texas.
on october 31, 2023, we acquired the net assets of eastern insurance. see note 3 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for information on the purchase price consideration paid to acquire eastern insurance. we funded the transaction using free cash flow and funds received from an unsecured senior notes offering. the acquired eastern insurance business offers comprehensive commercial property/casualty and personal lines products as well as employee benefits consulting to clients throughout the northeastern u.s.
on april 3, 2023, we acquired the partnership interests of buck. see note 3 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for information on the purchase price consideration paid to acquire buck. we funded the transaction using free cash flow and funds received from an unsecured senior notes offering. the acquired buck business is a leading provider of retirement, human resources and employee benefits consulting and administration services. total expected expense to integrate buck into our operations is approximately $125.0 million.
on december 1, 2021, we acquired substantially all of the willis re for an initial gross consideration of $3.17 billion, and potential additional consideration of $750 million subject to certain third-year revenue targets. we funded the transaction using cash on hand, including the $1.4 billion of net cash raised in our may 17, 2021 follow-on common stock offering, $850 million of net cash borrowed in our may 20, 2021 30-year senior note issuance, $750 million of net cash borrowed in our november 9, 2021 10-year ($400 million) and 30-year ($350 million) senior note issuances and short‐term borrowings.
operating cash flows historically, we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet a substantial portion of our cash requirements. we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement (as defined below) will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. to fund acquisitions made during 2023 and 2022, we relied on a combination of net cash flows from operations, proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement, proceeds from issuances of senior unsecured notes and issuance of our common stock.
cash provided by operating activities was $2,031.7 million and $1,390.0 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to growth in our core broking and risk management operations, timing differences between periods with cash receipts and disbursements related to other current assets and current liabilities compared to 2022, and the collection of refined coal production related receivables due to the wind up of clean coal operations and the cash benefit related to the utilization of irc section 45 tax credits that occurred in 2022. during the three-month period ended march 31, 2022, we collected $71.1 million of clean coal production related receivables and made $84.8 million in payments for clean coal production related payables that were accrued in our december 31, 2021 consolidated balance sheet. with respect to the 2022 provision for deferred income taxes, the decrease in the deferred tax asset for the utilization of irc section 45 tax credits was offset by the increase in deferred tax assets related to capitalized indirect property costs and u.k. net operating loss carryforwards.
the 2023 income taxes paid amounts were favorably impacted compared to 2022 due to the reversal of the tax method changes on our 2022 tax return filed in the fourth quarter of 2023. also in 2022, we elected to defer the utilization of 2022 net operating losses in the u.k. causing additional cash tax payments of $49.0 million relating to 2022. the u.k. payments would have been made in future periods, and do not represent additional taxes due.
during 2023 and 2022, employee matching contributions to the 401(k) plan of $73.8 million and $65.7 million, respectively, relating to 2022 and 2021 were funded using common stock.
our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations, as adjusted, for our non-cash expenses, which include depreciation, amortization, change in estimated acquisition earnout payables, deferred compensation, restricted stock, and stock-based and other non-cash compensation expenses. historically, cash provided by operating activities was unfavorably impacted if the amount of irc section 45 tax credits generated (which is the amount we recognized for financial reporting purposes) was greater than the amount of tax credits utilized to reduce our tax cash obligations. excess tax credits produced in 2021 and 2020 resulted in an increase to our deferred tax assets, which was a net use of cash related to operating activities. in 2023, irc section 45 credits were no longer generated due to the irc section 45 program expiring as of december 31, 2021, and therefore the irc section 45 credit utilization against our cash tax obligation resulted in favorable cash flow in 2023. please see "clean energy investments" below for more information on their potential future impact on cash provided by operating activities.
when assessing our overall liquidity, we believe that the focus should be on net earnings as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (i.e., ebitdac), and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. consolidated ebitdac was $2,555.6 million and $2,266.5 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively. net earnings attributable to controlling interests were $969.5 million and $1,114.2 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively. we believe that ebitdac items are indicators of trends in liquidity.
change in presentation of fiduciary assets and liabilities in first quarter 2023
in first quarter 2023, we changed the presentation of certain amounts and classifications in our consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows to identify and present fiduciary assets and liabilities and respective changes of these accounts in the balance sheet and statement of cash flows. these revisions also better reflect the cash flows associated with our operations. lines for accounts receivable, fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities were added and lines for restricted cash, premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable to underwriting enterprises were removed. in addition to these changes, we moved the net change in fiduciary assets and liabilities from the operating section to the financing section of the statement of cash flows. we made the applicable revisions to the december 31, 2022 balance sheet and statement of cash flow for the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 to conform to the current period presentation. these changes had no impact on the 2022 and 2021 consolidated statement of earnings or december 31, 2022 and 2021 stockholders' equity. see note 5 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for an additional discussion of the change in presentation of fiduciary assets and liabilities.
defined benefit pension plan our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc. the employee retirement security act of 1974, as amended (which we refer to as erisa), could impose a minimum funding requirement for our plan. we were not required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2023 and 2022 plan years. funding requirements are based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of our historical funding. the plan's actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements. funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. in addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not due under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows, including dividends, acquisitions and common stock repurchases. during 2023 and 2022 we did not make discretionary contributions to the plan.
see note 13 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit pension plan. we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension plan (which we refer to together as the plan). the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plan is recorded in "accumulated other comprehensive loss," net of tax, in our consolidated balance sheet. we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings, as appropriate, in the year in which they occur. numerous items may lead to a change in funded status of the plan, including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates.
the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2023 resulted in an increase in noncurrent assets in 2023 of $12.3 million. in 2023, the funded status of the plan was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31, 2023 and other assumption changes, the net impact of which was approximately $8.6 million. in addition, the funded status was favorably impacted by returns on the plan's assets being significantly higher in 2023 than anticipated by approximately $20.9 million. in 2022, the funded status of the plan was favorably impacted by an increase in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31, 2022 and other assumption changes, the net impact of which was approximately $70.5 million. in addition, the funded status was unfavorably impacted by returns on the plan's assets being significantly lower in 2022 than anticipated by approximately $(72.8) million (negative return). the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2022 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent assets in 2022 of $2.3 million. while the change in the funded status of the plan had no direct impact on our cash flows from operations in 2023 and 2022, potential changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods.
investing cash flows capital expenditures - capital expenditures were $193.6 million and $182.7 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively. in 2023 and 2022 capital expenditures include amounts incurred related to office moves, investments made in it and software development projects. relating to the development of our corporate headquarters, we received property tax related credits under a tax-increment financing note from rolling meadows, illinois and an illinois state edge tax credit. incentives from these two programs could total between $50.0 million and $80.0 million over a fifteen-year period. in 2024, we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately $175.0 million, part of which is related to expenditures on office moves and investments being made in it and software development projects. the decrease in the expected capital expenditures in 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily due to lower integration related expenditures.
acquisitions - cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, was $3,041.9 million and $764.9 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increased use of cash for acquisitions in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to our acquisition of buck, eastern insurance, cadence insurance and my plan manager. in addition, during 2023 and 2022 we issued 2.5 million shares ($525.8 million) and 0.9 million shares ($164.6 million), respectively, of our common stock as payment for a portion of the total consideration paid for acquisitions and earnout payments. we completed 51 and 37 acquisitions in 2023 and 2022, respectively. annualized revenues of businesses acquired in 2023 and 2022 totaled approximately $885.1 million and $246.5 million, respectively. in 2024, we expect to use new debt, our credit agreement (as defined below), cash from operations and our common stock, or a combination thereof to fund all of the acquisitions we complete.
in order to maintain leverage ratios and investment grade credit ratings or if liquidity concerns arise, we may be more likely to use common stock to fund acquisitions.
dispositions - during 2023 and 2022, we sold several books of business and recognized one-time gains of $10.0 million and $13.0 million, respectively. we received cash proceeds of $9.9 million and $11.0 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to these transactions.
clean energy investments - during the period from 2009 through 2021, we made significant investments in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualified for tax credits under irc section 45. the irc section 45 tax credits generate positive cash flow by reducing the amount of federal income taxes we pay. we anticipate positive net cash flow related to irc section 45 activity in 2024. however, there are several variables that can impact net cash flow from clean energy investments in any given year. therefore, accurately predicting cash in particular future periods is not possible at this time. however, if we continue to generate sufficient taxable income to use the tax credits produced by our irc section 45 investments, we anticipate that these investments will continue to generate positive net cash flows due to the utilization of irc section 45 tax credits to offset taxable income in years after the program expired. in october 2023, we filed our 2022 federal income tax return and elected to discontinue a tax method change. this resulted in the addback of tax credits that were not utilized on the tax return by approximately $157.0 million, which was recorded in the fourth quarter 2023. amended tax returns in the fourth quarter 2023 and closed tax years accounted for the addback of unutilized tax credits of $6.6 million of irc section 45 tax credits. in october 2022, we filed our 2021 federal tax return and elected to continue a tax method change in that return. this resulted in an acceleration of the amount of tax credits that we utilized on the return by approximately $150.0 million, which was recorded in fourth quarter 2022. we also amended our 2014 and 2015 federal tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2022, which resulted in a refund of $3.7 million of irc section 45 tax credits. while we cannot precisely forecast the cash flow impact in any particular period, we anticipate that the net cash flow impact of irc section 45 activity will be positive overall. please see "clean energy investments" on page 54 for a more detailed description of these investments and their risks and uncertainties.
financing cash flows at december 31, 2023, we had $3,550.0 million of senior notes, $3,948.0 million of corporate‐related borrowings outstanding under separate note purchase agreements entered into during the period from 2014 to 2021, $245.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement, $289.0 million outstanding under our premium financing debt facility and a cash and cash equivalent balance of $971.6 million. see note 8 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the senior notes, note purchase agreements, the credit agreement (as defined below) and the premium financing debt facility.
consistent with past practice, as of december 31, 2023 we had pre-issuance hedges open for $150.0 million for 2024. during the three months ended december 31, 2023, we settled approximately $128.0 million of interest rate contracts hedges with a notional value of $900.0 million that will be amortized into interest expense in future periods.
the senior notes, note purchase agreements, the credit agreement and the premium financing debt facility contain various financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios. we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31, 2023.

credit agreement - on june 22, 2023, we entered into the new credit agreement (which we refer to as the credit agreement) with an administrative agent and a group of other lenders. the credit agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of $1,200.0 million (including a $75.0 million letter of credit sub-facility), which is also available in pounds sterling, canadian dollars, australian dollars, new zealand dollars, euros, japanese yen and any other currencies agreed by the lenders. on november 7, 2023, we entered into the first amendment to the credit agreement, pursuant to which we increased the commitments under the credit agreement to $1,700.0 million. the credit agreement permits us to designate wholly-owned subsidiaries located in certain jurisdictions as additional borrowers, the obligations of which under the credit agreement will be guaranteed by the company, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the credit agreement. any subsidiary that guarantees any notes under the company's existing note purchase agreements is required to guarantee the obligations under the credit agreement. there are currently no subsidiary borrowers or guarantors under the credit agreement.
loans borrowed under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable annual rate based on a customary benchmark rate for each available currency including secured overnight financing rate (which we refer to as sofr) for loans in u .s. dollars, or at our election solely for loans in u.s. dollars, the base rate, plus in each case an applicable margin. interest rates on base rate loans and outstanding drawings on letters of credit under the credit agreement will be based on the base rate, as defined in the credit agreement, plus a margin of 0.00% to 0.375%, depending on the rating of our long-term senior unsecured debt. interest rates for sofr loans and loans in currencies other than u.s. dollars under the credit agreement will be based on, as applicable, a sofr daily floating rate, term sofr, alternative currency daily rate or alternative currency term rate, as defined in the credit agreement, plus a margin of 0.775% to 1.375%, depending on the rating of our long-term senior unsecured debt. the annual facility fee related to the credit agreement is between 0.100% and 0.250% of the revolving credit commitment, depending on the rating of our long-term senior unsecured debt. subject to certain conditions stated in the credit agreement, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the credit agreement at any time during the term of the credit agreement. funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for general corporate and working capital purposes of the company and its subsidiaries.

there were $245.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31, 2023. due to the outstanding borrowing and letters of credit, $1,443.4 million remained available for potential borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31, 2023.
we use the credit agreement to post letters of credit and to borrow funds to supplement our operating cash flows from time to time. during 2023, we borrowed an aggregate of $3,795.0 million and repaid $3,610.0 million under our credit agreement and under the second amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement. during 2022, we borrowed an aggregate of $2,570.0 million and repaid $2,555.0 million under the amended (and second amended) and restated multicurrency credit agreement which was terminated on june 22, 2023. principal uses of the 2023 and 2022 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions, earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes.
premium financing debt facility - on october 31, 2023, we entered into an amendment to our revolving loan facility (which we refer to as the premium financing debt facility) that provides funding for the three australian (au) and new zealand (nz) premium finance subsidiaries. the premium financing debt facility is comprised of: (i) facility b is separated into au$390.0 million and nz$25.0 million tranches (the nz$ tranche will be decreased as of may 1, 2024 to nz$10.0 million), (ii) facility c, an au$60.0 million equivalent multi‐currency overdraft tranche and (iii) facility d, a nz$15.0 million equivalent multi-currency overdraft tranche.
the interest rates on facility b are interbank rates, which vary by tranche, duration and currency, plus a margin of 1.500% and 1.850% for the au$ and nz$ tranches, respectively. the interest rates on facilities c and d are 30 day interbank rates, plus a margin of 0.830% and 0.990% for the au$ and nz$ tranches, respectively. the annual fee for facility b is 0.675% and 0.8325% for the undrawn commitments for the au$ and nz$ tranches, respectively. the annual fee for facility c is 0.77% and for facility d is 0.90% of the total commitments of the facilities.

dividends - our board of directors determines our dividend policy. our board of directors determines dividends on our common stock on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings, our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets.
in 2023, we declared $478.8 million in cash dividends on our common stock, or $2.20 per common share. on december 15, 2023, we paid a fourth quarter dividend of $0.55 per common share to shareholders of record as of december 1, 2023. on january 24, 2024, we announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter 2024 of $0.60 per common share. if the dividend is maintained at $0.60 per common share throughout 2024, this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2024 of approximately $519.8 million (based on the outstanding shares as of december 31, 2023), or an anticipated increase in cash used of approximately $46.2 million compared to 2023. we can make no assurances regarding the amount of any future dividend payments.
shelf registration statement - on march 8, 2021 we filed a shelf registration statement on form s-3 with the sec, registering the offer and sale from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt securities, guarantees, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts, or units. the availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement depends on investor demand, market conditions and other factors. we make no assurances regarding when, or if, we will issue any securities under this registration statement. on november 15, 2022, we filed a second shelf registration statement on form s-4 with the sec, registering 7.0 million shares of our common stock that we may offer and issue from time to time in connection with future acquisitions of other businesses, assets or securities. at december 31, 2023, 6.2 million shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement.
common stock repurchases - we have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors in july 2021 that authorizes the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of common stock. during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not repurchase shares of our common stock. the plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices, as we may deem advantageous, in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular number of shares, and the plan may be suspended at any time at our discretion. funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, short-term or long-term borrowings under our credit agreement or other sources.
public offering of common stock - on may 12, 2021, we entered into an underwriting agreement with morgan stanley & co. llc to issue 9.0 million shares of our common stock in a public offering. on may 12 2021, we agreed to price the offering of 9.0 million shares of our common stock at $142.00 and granted the underwriters in the offering a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1.3 million shares of our common stock at the same price. on may 12, 2021, the underwriters exercised the option to purchase an additional 1.3 million shares. the offering closed on may 17, 2021 and 10.3 million shares of our common stock were issued for net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and other expenses related to this offering, of $1,437.9 million. we used the net proceeds of this offering related to the 2051 notes to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the willis re transaction.
at-the-market equity program - on november 15, 2022, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with morgan stanley & co. llc, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, up to 3,000,000 shares of our common stock through morgan stanley as sales agent. we intend to use the net proceeds of sales under this program to fund future acquisitions from time to time or for general corporate purposes. pursuant to the agreement, shares may be sold by means of ordinary brokers' transactions, including on the new york stock exchange, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to the prevailing market prices, or at negotiated prices, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed upon by us and morgan stanley. during the quarter ended december 31, 2023, we did not sell shares of our common stock under the program.
common stock issuances - another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were $120.2 million in 2023 and $123.1 million in 2022. on may 10, 2022, our stockholders approved the 2022 long-term incentive plan (which we refer to as the ltip), which replaced our previous stockholder-approved 2017 long-term incentive plan. all of our officers, employees and non‐employee directors are eligible to receive awards under the ltip. awards which may be granted under the ltip include non‐qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance units, any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria. stock options with respect to 12.2 million shares (less any shares of restricted stock issued under the ltip - 2.8 million shares of our common stock were available for this purpose as of december 31, 2023) were available for grant under the ltip at december 31, 2023. our employee stock purchase plan allows our employees to purchase our common stock at 95% of its fair market value. proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, and we believe this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future.
we have a qualified contributory savings and thrift 401(k) plan covering the majority of our domestic employees. for eligible employees who have met the plan's age and service requirements to receive matching contributions, we historically have matched 100% of pre-tax and roth elective deferrals up to a maximum of 5.0% of eligible compensation, subject to federal limits on plan contributions and not in excess of the maximum amount deductible for federal income tax purposes. beginning with the match paid in 2021, the amount matched by the company will be discretionary and annually determined by management. employees must be employed and eligible for the plan on the last day of the plan year to receive a matching contribution, subject to certain exceptions enumerated in the plan document. matching contributions are subject to a five-year graduated vesting schedule and can be funded in cash or company stock. we expensed (net of plan forfeitures) $86.0 million and $73.8 million related to the plan in 2023 and 2022, respectively. during 2022, our board of directors authorized the 5.0% employer matching contributions on eligible compensation to the 401(k) plan for the 2022 plan year to be funded with our common stock, which was funded in february 2023. during 2023, our board of directors authorized the 5.0% employer matching contributions on eligible compensation to the 401(k) plan for the 2023 plan year to be funded with our common stock, which is expected to be funded in february 2024.
other liquidity matters letters of credit and other guarantees we have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a letter of credit. we had total letters of credit outstanding of $21.2 million at december 31, 2023 and $13.0 million at december 31, 2022. these letters of credit secure our self-insurance deductibles on our own insurance programs, allow certain of our captive operations to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements, lease security deposits and collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity. see note 17 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments.
earnout obligations substantially all of the purchase agreements related to the acquisitions we do contain provisions for potential earnout obligations. for all of our acquisitions made in the period from 2020 to 2023 that contain potential earnout obligations, such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition. the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future potential operating results of the acquired entities over a two- to three-year period subsequent to the acquisition date. the aggregate amount of the maximum earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was $2,009.8 million, of which $1,294.2 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2023 based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made, of which approximately $564.8 million can be settled in cash or stock at our option and $729.4 million must be settled in cash.
apart from commitments, guarantees, and contingencies, as disclosed herein and in note 17 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. see "information concerning forward-looking statements" at the beginning of this report.
contractual obligations our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2023 are comprised of principal payments on debt, interest payments on debt, operating leases, pension benefit plan and purchase obligations.
operating leases are primarily comprised of leased office space throughout the world. as leases expire, we do not anticipate difficulty in negotiating renewals or finding other satisfactory space if the premise becomes unavailable. in certain circumstances, we may have unused space and may seek to sublet such space to third parties, depending upon the demands for office space in the locations involved. see note 15 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these operating lease obligations.
defined benefit pension plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements pursuant to the employee retirement income security act and other regulations. we may make additional discretionary contributions. see note 13 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit pension plan.
purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specifies all significant terms, including the goods to be purchased or services to be rendered, the price at which the goods or services are to be rendered, and the timing of the transactions. most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services, marketing arrangements or other service contracts. we had no other cash requirements from known contractual obligations and commitments that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. see note 17 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these contractual obligations.
outlook - we believe that we have sufficient capital and access to additional capital to meet our short- and long-term cash flow needs.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, right-of-use assets, investments (including our irc section 45 investments), income taxes, revenue recognition, deferred costs, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein. we believe the following significant accounting estimates may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. see note 1 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies. see note 2 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the our financial results, if determinable.
revenue recognition description the primary source of revenues for our brokerage services is commissions from underwriting enterprises, based on a percentage of premiums paid by our clients, or fees received from clients based on an agreed level of service usually in lieu of commissions. these commissions and fees revenues are substantially recognized at a point in time on the effective date of the associated policies when control of the policy transfers to the client, as well as deferring certain revenues to reflect delivery of services over the contract period. whether we are paid a commission or a fee, the vast majority of our services are associated with the placement of an insurance (or insurance-like) contract. accordingly, we recognize approximately 80% of our commission and fee revenues on the effective date of the underlying insurance contract. the amount of revenue we recognize is based on our costs to provide our services up and through that effective date, including an appropriate estimate of our profit margin on a portfolio basis. based on the proportion of additional services we provide in each period after the effective date of the insurance contract, including an appropriate estimate of our profit margin, we recognize approximately 15% of our commission and fee revenues in the first three months, and the remaining 5% thereafter.
for supplemental revenues certain underwriting enterprises may pay us additional revenues for the volume of premium placed with them and for insights into our sales pipeline, our sales capabilities or our risk selection knowledge. these amounts are in excess of the commission and fee revenues discussed above, and not all business we place with underwriting enterprises is eligible for supplemental revenues. unlike contingent revenues, discussed below, these revenues are primarily a fixed amount or fixed percentage of premium of the underlying eligible insurance contracts. for supplemental revenue contracts based on a fixed percentage of premium, our obligation to the underwriting enterprise is substantially completed upon the effective date of the underlying insurance contract and revenue is fully earned at that time. for supplemental revenue contracts based on a fixed amount, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period consistent with the performance of our obligations, almost always over an annual term.
for contingent revenues certain underwriting enterprises may pay us additional revenues for our sales capabilities, our risk selection knowledge, or our administrative efficiencies. these amounts are in excess of the commission or fee revenues discussed above, and not all business we place with participating underwriting enterprises is eligible for contingent revenues. unlike supplemental revenues, also discussed above, these revenues are variable, generally based on growth, the loss experience of the underlying insurance contracts, and/or our efficiency in processing the business. we generally operate under calendar year contracts, but we do not receive these revenues from the underwriting enterprises until the following calendar year, generally in the first and second quarters, after verification of the performance indicators outlined in the contracts. accordingly, during each reporting period, we must make our best estimate of amounts we have earned using historical averages and other factors to project such revenues.
see revenue recognition and contracts with customers in notes 1 and 4 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements.
judgments and uncertainties for commissions and fees, these periods may be different than the underlying premium payment patterns of the insurance contracts, but the vast majority of our services are fully provided within one year of the insurance contract effective date. for supplemental and contingent commissions, we base our estimates each period on a contract-by-contract basis where available. in certain cases, it is impractical to assess a very large number of smaller contingent revenue contracts, so we use a historical portfolio estimate in aggregate. because our expectation of the ultimate contingent revenue amounts to be earned can vary from period to period, especially in contracts sensitive to loss ratios, our estimates might change significantly from quarter to quarter. for example, in circumstances where our revenues are dependent on a full calendar year loss ratio, adverse loss experience in the fourth quarter could not only negate revenue earnings in the fourth quarter, but also trigger the need to reverse revenues previously recognized during the prior quarters. variable consideration is recognized when we conclude, based on all the facts and information available at the reporting date, that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to recognize revenue. as noted above, estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. the vast majority of our brokerage contracts and service understandings are for a period of one year or less, and historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize revenue during the past three fiscal years.
income taxes description we estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income. income tax includes an estimate for withholding taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the u.s. but does not include an estimate for taxes on earnings considered to be indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary. deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset. we record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. see income taxes in notes 1 and 19 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements.
judgments and uncertainties changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future. our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate. our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. other than those potential impacts, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances. however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. to the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and generally result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.
impairment of goodwill description goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. if it is determined, based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than its carrying amount or if significant changes to macro-economic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. the quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. additionally, we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test. upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill. however, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill outside of the required annual assessment if, among other things, we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization.
judgments and uncertainties we estimate the fair value of our reporting units considering the use of various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach (discounted cash flow method) and another technique being a market approach (guideline public company method), which use significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. we include assumptions about revenue growth, operating margins, discount rates and valuation multiples which consider our budgets, business plans, economic projections and marketplace data, and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. generally, we utilize operating margin assumptions based on future expectations, operating margins historically realized in the reporting units' industries and industry marketplace valuation multiples. see intangible assets in notes 1 and 7 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements.
our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill during the last three years. during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, all of our material reporting units passed the impairment analysis.
some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, market ebitdac comparables and credit ratings. while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangibles, it is possible a material change could occur. if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, it could result in material impairments of our goodwill.
impairment of amortizable intangible assets description amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use the asset, a change in its physical condition, or an unexpected change in financial performance.
when evaluating amortizable intangible assets for impairment, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated undiscounted future cash flows. an impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. the impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.
we recorded impairment charges related to amortizable intangible assets of $3.5 million, $2.0 million, and $17.6 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. see intangible assets in notes 1 and 7 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements.
judgments and uncertainties our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions, including useful lives and intended use of assets, observable market valuations, forecasted revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of amortizable intangible assets during the last three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments or useful lives of amortizable intangible assets. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material.
earnout obligations description substantially all of the purchase agreements related to the acquisitions we do contain provisions for potential earnout obligations. the amounts recorded as earnout payables, which are primarily based upon the terms of the purchase agreements and the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two- to three-year period subsequent to the acquisition date, are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration. we will record subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations, including the accretion of discount, in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred.
judgments and uncertainties the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements, which is a level 3 fair value measurement. in determining fair value, we estimate the acquired entity's future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth and/or profitability. revenue growth rates generally ranged from 5.0% to 20.0% for our 2023 acquisitions. we estimated future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and the financial projections just described. we then discounted these payments to present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration market based rates of return that reflect the ability of the acquired entity to achieve the targets. the discount rates generally ranged from 6.7% to 9.6% for our 2023 acquisitions.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. changes in financial projections, market participant assumptions for revenue growth and/or profitability, or the risk-adjusted discount rate, would result in a change in the fair value of recorded earnout obligations. see note 3 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2023 business combinations.
business combinations description we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control of a business is obtained, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
we use various models to determine the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such as discounted cash flow to value amortizable intangible assets.
for significant acquisitions we may use independent third-party valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. see note 3 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2023 business combinations.
judgments and uncertainties significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, particularly intangible assets. we make estimates and assumptions about projected future cash flows including sales growth, operating margins, attrition rates, and discount rates based on historical results, business plans, expected synergies, perceived risk and marketplace data considering the perspective of marketplace participants.
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions, which could result in subsequent impairments.

item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 is presented under results of operations of this form 10-k. discussions regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to 2021 have been omitted from this annual report on form 10-k, but can be found in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022, filed with the sec on february 27, 2023, which is available without charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov and on our investor relations website at investor.aligntech.com.
executive overview of results trends and uncertainties our business strategic priorities focus on four principal pillars for growth: (i) international expansion; (ii) gp dentist treatment; (iii) patient demand; and (iv) orthodontic utilization. our growth strategy depends on our ability to facilitate the digital transformation of dentistry happening around the world, our continuous focus on innovation, and expansion to meet and exceed evolving customer expectations as the array of products and services available to them increases.
we strive to deliver on each of our strategic growth drivers through a variety of interrelated enterprise-wide efforts including:
•continuing penetration and adoption of invisalign products, intraoral scanners and cad/cam solutions in international markets by investing in manufacturing operations, research and development, clinical treatment planning, sales and marketing and building our quality and regulatory capabilities in existing and emerging markets globally. for instance, in 2022, we opened a new aligner fabrication facility in wroclaw, poland as a part of our strategy to bring operational facilities closer to customers to serve them more quickly and respond to their needs more effectively as well as new treatment planning operations in targeted regional geographies. we have also diversified our research and development activities throughout europe, which has created a longer term, more stable environment for consistent hiring, retention and innovation in a variety of high technology sectors. we are in over 100 markets and have 13 fabrication and treatment locations throughout the world.
•targeting growth opportunities with international orthodontists and gp customers, particularly with adopters of digital dentistry platforms by tailoring our sales and marketing strategies, manufacturing operations and resources around the unique needs of each customer channel. as we continue growing, we intend to opportunistically expand our research, development, manufacturing, treatment planning, and sales and marketing operations to meet local and regional demand thoughtfully and deliberately. over the longer-term, we expect international revenues to grow faster than americas' revenues as a result of growing international demand, our continued investment in international market expansion, the size of the market opportunities and our relatively low market penetration in these regions.
•building confidence within the gp and orthodontic communities through training and education efforts to increase their adoption and utilization of digital dental practice transformation and clear aligner treatment. we continue to expand our clear aligner customer base by educating new doctors on the benefits of digital dentistry through the invisalign system. we furthermore demonstrate to gps and orthodontists how the itero portfolio of intraoral scanners and cad/cam restorative services and workflows can increase revenues and profitability for their dental practices by enhancing patient experiences and creating operational practice efficiencies.
•investing in research and development that allows us to innovate, develop and bring to market products and solutions that deliver the ever-increasing clinical precision and predictability that doctors expect with the speed and convenience their patients require.
•creating demand and enabling patient conversion through targeted investments in advertising and public relations through social media, influencers and other forms of digital communications to encourage treatment by invisalign trained doctors. we believe that well-designed, targeted sales and marketing promotions that build on our strong brand awareness allow us to differentiate our products and solutions from traditional and emerging competitors. to increase awareness and educate young adults, parents and teens about the benefits of the invisalign brand, in 2023 we continued to invest in and create campaigns across markets in media platforms such as tiktok, instagram, youtube, snapchat, wechat, and douyin. we expect to make further investments to create additional demand for invisalign system treatment driving more consumers to dental professionals for those treatments.
•pursuing new product lines that complement our doctor-prescribed principal products currently available in certain e-commerce and retail channels in the u.s. similarly, in 2023, we continued our focus on our doctor subscription plan and grew our underpenetrated share of the retainer business through strategic marketing campaigns focused on driving adoption and increasing market share in the u.s., canada, iberia and the nordics.
•increasing global orthodontic utilization rates as doctors' clinical confidence in the efficacy and predictability of the invisalign system increases with advancements in products and technology and as patients and doctors demand treatments that emphasize convenience and safety through fewer visits and less invasive and quicker treatments. in addition, the teenage and younger market makes up about 70% of the approximately 22 million total annual global orthodontic case starts. we continue to emphasize the benefits of the invisalign system for teenage and younger patient treatments through education, training and sales and marketing programs. in 2023, we had record shipments to teenage and younger patients. we expect utilization rates to continue to rise. however, our utilization rates will fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, which may include seasonal trends in our business, consumer demand due to macroeconomic factors, and adoption rates for new products and features.
macroeconomic challenges and military conflict in ukraine and the middle east our revenues are susceptible to fluctuations caused by macroeconomic conditions, inflation, changes to currency exchange rates, rising interest rates, actual and threatened wars and military actions, threats of or actual recessions, supply chain challenges, market volatility, and other factors, each of which impacts customer confidence, consumer sentiment and demand. many of these same factors also impact our costs and those of our suppliers through higher raw material prices, transportation costs, labor costs, supply and distribution operations. in 2023, we believe that sales of our products were primarily harmed by macroeconomic conditions that ultimately adversely impacted disposable income and consumer demand. in particular, dental practices and industry research firms reported deteriorating orthodontic trends for the third and fourth quarters of 2023, including decreased patient visits and increased patient appointment cancellations, along with fewer case starts overall, especially among adult patients. the impact of declining demand varied by time and region, making operational results uncertain and difficult to predict.
additionally, many of our international operations are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. in 2023, the macroeconomic slowing or contraction resulted in foreign exchange volatility causing the u.s dollar to strengthen against other currencies. this negatively impacted our financial condition and results of operation compared to 2022. foreign exchange volatility and the subsequent strengthening or weakening of the u.s dollar against other currencies remains uncertain and unpredictable.
moreover, military conflicts increase the unpredictability of the volatile macroeconomic conditions. while the military conflict between russia and ukraine did not materially impact our 2023 financial condition and results of operations, we expect the conflict will continue to create market uncertainties and dampen consumer sentiment and demand, particularly in europe.
similarly, the recent conflict in the middle east may further exacerbate general and regional macroeconomic instability, particularly if fighting is prolonged, it spreads to other locations, creates shipping and logistical challenges or cost increases, or leads to sanctions or boycotts. our itero business is headquartered in israel and the timing and cost of shipping our products has been impacted. additionally, we have employees and consultants in israel that have been called for military service and they may be unavailable for an unknown period of time. the conflict may continue to spread to other areas which may further impact our business. we continue to monitor the potential for violence and military actions that may directly or indirectly impact our personnel, manufacturing, supply chain, and sales.
changing product preferences as the markets for clear aligners and digital processes and workflows used to transform the practice of dentistry continue to mature, we anticipate customer and patient expectations and demands will evolve. we expect to meet customer demands with innovative treatment options that include more choices to address a wider scope of treatment goals and budgets based on our existing and new products. this may result in larger and unpredictable variations in geographic and product mix and selling prices with uncertain implications on our financial statements and business operations.
we strive to manage the challenges from the trends and uncertainties, including the macroeconomic conditions, military conflict and the evolution of our target markets, by focusing on improving our operations, building flexibility and efficiencies in our processes, adjusting our business models to changing circumstances and offering products that meet market demand. specifically, we are managing cost impacts through pricing actions, implementing cost saving measures and slowing hiring. we also continue to innovate and introduce new and enhanced products that augment our doctor customer and patient experiences.
for instance, in the first quarter of 2023, we successfully launched the invisalign comprehensive 3in3 product. the 3in3 configuration offers doctors invisalign comprehensive treatment with a three-year treatment expiration date and three additional clear aligners included prior to the treatment expiration date. we anticipate adoption of the invisalign comprehensive 3in3 product will continue to increase in 2024. the 3in3 product allows us to recognize more revenue up front but is offered at a lower price as compared to our traditional invisalign comprehensive product that has a five-year treatment expiration date with unlimited additional clear aligner prior to the treatment end date.
further discussion of the impact of these challenges on our business may be found in part i, item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k under the heading "risk factors."

other statistical data and trends
•as of december 31, 2023, 17 million people worldwide have been treated with our invisalign system. management measures these results by comparing to the millions of people who can benefit from straighter teeth and uses this data to target opportunities to expand the market for orthodontics by educating consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using the invisalign system.
•for the fourth quarter of 2023, total invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the americas increased to 95.1%, up from 92.7%* in the fourth quarter of 2022 and international scans increased to 88.1%, up from 86.8% in the fourth quarter of 2022. for the fourth quarter of 2023, 98.0% of invisalign cases submitted by north american orthodontists were submitted digitally.
•the total utilization rate in 2023 was 19.1 cases per doctor compared to 19.3* cases per doctor in 2022 and 20.9* cases per doctor in 2021. our utilization rates have declined in 2023 due to the macroeconomic conditions and other factors as described in the trends and uncertainties section above. in general, we expect utilization rates to rise over time although they are likely to fluctuate from period to period.
•north america: the utilization rate among our north american orthodontist customers was 94.5 cases per doctor in 2023 compared to 94.9* cases per doctor in 2022 and 99.7* cases per doctor in 2021 and the utilization rate among our north american gp customers was 14.0 cases per doctor in 2023 compared to 13.9 cases per doctor in 2022 and 14.3 cases per doctor in 2021.
•international: international doctor utilization rate was 16.3 cases per doctor in 2023 compared to 16.2 cases per doctor in 2022 and 17.5 cases per doctor in 2021.
* invisalign utilization rates are calculated by the number of cases shipped divided by the number of doctors to whom cases were shipped. our international region includes europe, middle east and africa ("emea") and asia pacific ("apac"). latin america ("latam") is excluded from the international region based on its immateriality to the year; however is included in the total utilization.
during the third quarter of 2023, we began including touch up case revenues in americas and/or international net revenues that were previously included in non-case revenues and have recast business metrics for the periods presented above accordingly.
results of operations net revenues by reportable segment we group our operations into two reportable segments: clear aligner segment and systems and services segment.
•our clear aligner segment consists of comprehensive products, non-comprehensive products and non-case revenues as defined below:
•comprehensive products include, but are not limited to, invisalign comprehensive and invisalign first.
•non-comprehensive products include, but are not limited to, invisalign moderate, lite and express packages and invisalign go and invisalign go plus.
•we also offer in the u.s., canada, and emea, a doctor subscription program which is our monthly subscription-based clear aligner program. the program allows doctors the flexibility to order retainers and low-stage "touch-up" clear aligners within their subscribed tier and is designed for a segment of experienced invisalign trained doctors who are currently not regularly using our retainers or low-stage aligners. the low-stage aligners, the touch up product, are included as a non-comprehensive product.
•non-case products include, but are not limited to, retention products including retention aligners ordered through the doctor subscription program, invisalign training, adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment and invisalign accessory products that are complementary to our doctor-prescribed principal products such as aligner cases (clamshells), teeth whitening products, cleaning solutions (crystals, foam and other material) and other oral health products available in certain commerce channels in select markets.
•our systems and services segment consists of our itero intraoral scanning systems, which includes a single hardware platform and restorative or orthodontic software options. our services include subscription software, disposables, rentals, leases, pay per scan services, as well as exocad's cad/cam software solutions that integrate workflows to dental labs and dental practices.

total net revenues increased by $127.6 million in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily due to an increase in clear aligner average selling price ("asp"), an increase in clear aligner non-case revenue and higher systems and services services mix, partially offset by a decrease in both scanner volumes and asp's.
clear aligner - americas americas net revenues decreased by $9.0 million in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily due to a 2.1% decrease in case volumes, resulting in a reduction of net revenues of $31.4 million, partially offset by a $22.4 million increase due to higher asp. higher asp includes price increases which increased net revenues by $68.6 million along with higher additional aligners which increased net revenues by $43.9 million. the increases in asp were partially offset by higher promotional discounts which decreased net revenues by $44.3 million, a product mix shift to lower priced products which reduced net revenues by $37.6 million and higher sales credits which lowered net revenues $11.5 million.
clear aligner - international international net revenues increased by $100.5 million in 2023 as compared to 2022 due to a 3.5% increase in case volumes, resulting in an increase of net revenues by $46.9 million, and higher asp increasing net revenues by $53.6 million. higher asp was largely due to higher additional aligners increasing net revenues by $100.8 million and price increases on most products which increased net revenues by $96.9 million. the increases in asp were partially offset by a product mix shift to lower priced products reducing net revenues by $68.2 million, higher promotional discounts which reduced net revenues by $52.5 million, and unfavorable foreign exchange rates which decreased net revenues by $27.2 million.
clear aligner - non-case non-case net revenues increased by $35.2 million in 2023 compared to 2022 mainly due to increased volume of vivera retainers across all regions which includes retention aligners ordered through our doctor subscription program.
systems and services systems and services net revenues decreased by $0.9 million in 2023 as compared to 2022 primarily due to a lower number of scanners sold which lowered net revenues by $26.1 million and lower scanner asp which reduced net revenues by $23.9 million. the decrease in scanner net revenues was mostly offset by higher service revenues of $31.8 million and other revenues which increased $19.1 million primarily due to revenue from sales of certified pre-owned scanners, cad/cam software, and scanner rentals.

critical accounting estimates management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements. we evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis and use authoritative pronouncements, historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making the estimates. actual results could differ from those estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. for further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of aligners, scanners, and services from our clear aligner and systems and services segments. we enter into sales contracts that may consist of multiple distinct performance obligations where certain performance obligations of the sales contract are not delivered in one reporting period. we measure and allocate revenues according to asc 606-10, "revenues from contracts with customers."
determining the standalone selling price ("ssp") in order to allocate consideration from the contract to the individual performance obligations is the result of various factors, such as historical prices, changing trends and market conditions, costs, and gross margins. while changes in the allocation of the ssp between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenues recognized for a particular contract, any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which would have a material effect on our financial position and result of operations. this is because the contract consideration is allocated to each performance obligation, delivered or undelivered, at the inception of the contract based on the ssp of each distinct performance obligation.
we allocate consideration for each clear aligner treatment plan based on each unit's ssp. management considers a variety of factors such as same or similar product historical sales, costs, and gross margin, which may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation in making these estimates. in addition to historical data, we take into consideration changing trends and market conditions. for treatment plans with multiple options, we also consider usage rates, which is the number of times a customer is expected to order more aligners after the initial shipment. our process for estimating usage rates requires significant judgment and evaluation of inputs, including historical usage data by region, country and channel.
we estimate the ssp of each element in a scanner system and services sale taking into consideration same or similar product historical prices as well as our discounting strategies. for cad/cam services, we estimate the ssp of each element, including the initial software license and maintenance and support, using data such as historical prices.
unfulfilled performance obligations for clear aligners and scanners our unfulfilled performance obligations, including deferred revenues and backlog, and the estimated revenues expected to be recognized in the future related to these performance obligations are $1,578.3 million and $1,515.4 million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. this includes performance obligations from the clear aligner reportable segment, primarily the shipment of additional aligners, which are fulfilled over six months to five years. this also includes performance obligations from our systems and services reportable segment, primarily services and support, which are fulfilled over one to five years, and contracted deliveries of additional scanners. the estimate includes both product and service unfulfilled performance obligations and the time range reflects our best estimate of when we will transfer control to the customer and may change based on customer usage patterns, timing of shipments, readiness of customers' facilities for installation, and manufacturing availability.
impairment of goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on november 30th or more frequently if indicators of impairment are identified between annual testing dates. goodwill is tested for impairment between annual testing dates when events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value. when an indicator of impairment is identified we perform a quantitative impairment assessment in which we determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of the respective reporting unit. we generally determine the fair value of a reporting unit via a discounted cash flow analysis and allocate the net assets of the company to each reporting unit to determine carrying value. we will record an impairment charge when our quantitative impairment analysis indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. both the determination of fair value and carrying value of a reporting unit require management to exercise significant judgement related to operating assumptions and estimates and allocation methodologies.
finite-lived intangible assets finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. when an impairment indicator is identified, we perform a recoverability test, in which the estimated, undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset (asset group) are compared to the carrying value of the asset (asset group). when our recoverability test results in undiscounted cash flows more than carrying value, no impairment is recorded. however, when our recoverability test results in undiscounted cash flows that are less than carrying value, we determine the fair value of the asset (asset group) and reduce the carrying amount of the asset (asset group), through an impairment charge, to its fair value. the process of identifying impairment indicators, preparing an undiscounted cash flow and determining the fair value of the asset (asset group) require management to exercise significant judgement related to various assumptions and estimates.
if we were to have impairments to goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets, it could adversely affect our operating results. during the years ended 2023 and 2022, we did not have any impairment charges related to our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets.
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of u.s. gaap and complex domestic and international tax laws related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires the assessment of both of our historical and future performance as well as other relevant factors. realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income which is determined based on assumptions such as estimated growth rates in revenues, gross margins, future cash flows and discount rates. the accuracy of these estimates could be affected by unforeseen events or actual results, and the sustainability of our future tax benefits is dependent upon the acceptance of these valuation estimates and assumptions by the taxing authorities.
accounting for legal proceedings and litigation estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation are inherently difficult to make, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete facts and information. the final outcome of legal proceedings is dependent on many variables difficult to predict and, therefore, the ultimate cost to entirely resolve such matters may be materially different than the amount of current estimates. consequently, new information or changes in judgments and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows.

trends that may affect our future results in 2023, we identified key market trends and uncertainties that had or may have a negative effect on our performance. although we have mitigating strategies to minimize the risks posed by these trends and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful in preventing material impacts on our future results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. refer to "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k for discussion of additional risks we face.
•new competitive supply may exert pressure on our rental rates and adversely affect our operating results. during and after the covid-19 pandemic, the shift toward hybrid and remote work arrangements has led certain office and other reits and real estate companies to repurpose their underutilized office spaces into laboratory facilities. our success and the success of other laboratory operators have prompted and may continue to prompt new and existing life science developers to commence speculative redevelopment and/or development projects in anticipation of demand for laboratory facilities. these conversion and speculative development projects may result in a substantial increase in life science facility supply in the near future, potentially intensifying competition in the sector and placing downward pressure on future rental and occupancy rates.
our rental rates for renewed/re-leased space increased by 29.4%, 31.0%, and 37.9% during years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. our 2024 guidance range for rental rate increases on lease renewals/re-leases of 11.0% to 19.0% reflects lower expectations relative to the past several years. however, to remain competitive, we may need to further reduce our future rental rates below these projections. in addition, we may need to offer more tenant improvement allowances or additional tenant concessions, including free rent, to retain existing tenants or to attract new tenants.
as of december 31, 2023, we anticipate that 5.7 million rsf, primarily expected to be placed into service and stabilized during 2024-2027, will generate $495 million in incremental annual net operating income primarily commencing during 2024-2027. the realization of the aforementioned risks could hinder our ability to secure tenants for the remaining unleased rsf related to these projects at the expected rates, or at all, potentially leading to a shortfall in or delays in the commencement of the projected incremental annual net operation income.
•unfavorable capital markets and overall macroeconomic environment may negatively impact the value of our real estate and non-real estate portfolios, and may limit our ability to raise capital to further our business objectives.
the effective execution of our development and redevelopment activities is contingent upon our access to the required capital. in 2024, we expect to incur from $2.2 billion to $3.3 billion in construction and acquisition spending.
•lower property valuations and increased capitalization rates. a portion of our projected construction and acquisition spending is expected to be funded through dispositions of and sales of partial interests in non-core real estate assets. real estate investments are generally less liquid than many other investment types, which can present challenges in selling our properties timely or at desirable prices, particularly in an economic climate marked by uncertainties around inflation and interest rates.
should inflation remain elevated, the federal reserve may continue to raise the federal funds rate, which may lead to further increases in interest rates and costs of debt and equity financing. this could prevent prospective buyers of our real estate assets from obtaining required financing on favorable terms, potentially eliminating their participation in the market or forcing them to seek more expensive alternative funding options. such challenges for buyers could lead to a rise in properties available for sale, and could exert downward pressure on property valuations and elevate capitalization rates, potentially adversely impacting the sales proceeds we expect from our real estate asset sales in 2024.
the aforementioned surplus and pressures on valuations may be further intensified by the entry of new real estate investments in the laboratory space, discussed above. combined with high interest rates and reduced market liquidity, this may result in a prolonged period of reduced property valuations and increased capitalization rates, potentially necessitating the recognition of additional significant real estate impairments.
the table below presents a trend of increasing capitalization rates associated with the dispositions of and sales of partial interests in our real estate assets in 2021, 2022, and 2023 (dollars in thousands). while the increase in capitalization rates presented in the table can partly be attributed to the quality of non-core assets we sold, capitalization rates in general have increased in recent years, and there is no assurance that this upward trend will stabilize or reverse in the future.

•increased cost and limited availability of capital. in 2024, we expect a portion of our construction to be funded through bond issuances ranging from $600 million to $1.4 billion. however, should we encounter difficulties in selling our real estate assets at our targeted prices, we may need to increase our reliance on debt financing to fund our construction projects in 2024. if the current high interest rate environment persists or worsens, the debt funding option could become costlier, less accessible, or even unavailable, potentially limiting our ability to complete our development projects on schedule, thereby delaying our expected incremental annual income generation and negatively affecting our business.

(1)includes amortization of loan fees, amortization of debt premiums (discounts), and other bank fees.
•reduction in capitalized interest. our strategic focus is on prioritizing the completion of our highly leased projects under construction. additionally, we invest in our future pipeline with the goals of enhancing value and reducing the timeline to allow for vertical construction. this is in response to our expectation of increased future demand for these projects, and is reflected in our expectation for capitalized interest to range from $325 million to $355 million in 2024. refer to the definition of "capitalized interest" in the "non-gaap measures and definitions" section within item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
however, the current challenging macroeconomic environment, including the increased supply of laboratory space, higher costs or unavailability of debt, and challenges in obtaining sufficient proceeds from real estate asset dispositions, as discussed above, could necessitate a reevaluation of our current plans and lead to a temporary suspension of our construction projects. this could result in a decline in our 2024 capitalized interest below our current projections and in an increase in interest expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in 2024.
the table below presents our increasing capitalized interest and decreasing interest expense during 2021, 2022, and 2023 (dollars in thousands). however, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue into the future.

•volatility in non-real estate investments. we hold strategic investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science, agtech, and technology industries. these investments are subject to market and sector-specific risks that can substantially affect their valuation. like many other industries, the life science industry is susceptible to macroeconomic challenges, such as ongoing economic uncertainty and a tighter capital environment. these factors may lead to increased volatility in the valuation of our non-real estate investments.
in such an unfavorable environment, distributions from our investments - which we may receive as dividends, as liquidation distributions from our investments in limited partnerships, or as a result of mergers and acquisitions that lead to our privately held investees being acquired by other entities - could result in lower realized gains. moreover, should market conditions worsen, we may face challenges in selling these securities at optimal prices, potentially disrupting our capital strategy.
unfavorable market conditions could also indicate potential impairment of our investments in privately held entities that do not report nav per share and lead to the recognition of additional significant non-real estate impairments, lower realized gains, and higher unrealized losses.
the table below reflects the volatility of our non-real estate investments in 2021, 2022, and 2023 (in thousands):
realized gains(1)   unrealized gains (losses)        total investment income (loss)
2021        $215,845           $43,632                          $259,477

(1)includes impairment charges aggregating $74.6 million and $20.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. there were no impairment charges recognized during the year ended december 31, 2021.
the realization of any of the aforementioned risks could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, particularly our income from rentals, net operating income, our results of operations, funds from operations, operating margins, initial stabilized yields (unlevered) on new or existing construction projects, occupancy, eps, ffo per share, our overall business, and the market value of our common stock.
•mitigating factors:
•mega campus strategy: focus on premier class a/a+ assets in aaa innovation cluster locations. alexandria has established a high-quality labspace® asset base predominantly concentrated in markets with high barriers to entry. despite a recent increase in the availability of laboratory space, alexandria is expected to continue to benefit from our focus on class a/a+ assets strategically clustered in life science, agtech, and advanced technology mega campuses in innovation cluster locations in close proximity to top academic medical institutions. this proximity is a key driver of tenant demand. our campuses are used in two distinct ways: (i) to house the research operations of our tenants, and (ii) to recruit and retain the best talent available from a limited pool, which underscores why the scale, strategic design, and placement our mega campuses provide are critical.
ceos of life science companies typically anticipate rapid and exponential growth upon their companies' achieving scientific milestones. our mega campuses are designed for scalability, providing opportunities for our tenants to grow within our mega campuses, including through our future developments and redevelopments aggregating 31.5 million rsf, of which 66% is concentrated within our mega campuses. the strategic location of our mega campuses, which offer both high visibility and a clear path to growth, serves as a powerful motivator for tenants to lease space from us.
moreover, our tenants recognize that their success is directly linked to their ability to attract and retain personnel to advance their science. our mega campuses provide a superior set of amenities, services, and access to transit that offer our tenants valuable optionality. the collaborative, vibrant elements of our mega campuses, coupled with world-class amenities, enhance their confidence in using these spaces as effective recruiting tools. in contrast, a significant amount of the competitive supply in the market today consists of isolated, one-off buildings. these facilities may provide operational space, but they fall short in offering the scale and strategic design that our mega campuses deliver.
consequently, our external growth strategy focuses on creating new and enhancing existing mega campuses, which represent our strongest defense against competitive supply. over the past three decades, we have established a significant market presence in aaa innovation cluster locations. our mega campuses provide a comprehensive solution to life science tenants, one that is challenging to replicate due to the significant time and capital required to replicate this model. we believe the focus on our mega campus strategy will continue to position us favorably against potential supply of new competitive laboratory spaces. this strategy is partially responsible for our notable performance metrics listed below, which have been achieved despite the current challenging macroeconomic environment and residual impacts from the covid-19 pandemic:
•strong funds from operations per share - diluted, as adjusted for 2023 of $8.97 and an anticipated 5.6% growth to $9.47 per share in 2024 at the midpoint of our guidance range.
•solid same property net operating income growth of 3.4% and 4.6% (cash basis) for the year ended december 31, 2023 and anticipated same property net operating income growth of 1.5% and 4.0% (cash basis) at the midpoints of the respective guidance ranges for the year ending december 31, 2024.
•strong occupancy of 94.6% as of december 31, 2023 and anticipated strong occupancy ranging from 94.6% to 95.6% as of december 31, 2024.
•solid rental rate increases of 29.4% and 15.8% (cash basis) for the year ended december 31, 2023 and anticipated rental rate increases of 15.0% and 9.0% (cash basis) at the midpoints of the respective guidance ranges for the year ending december 31, 2024.
•in 2023, our executed leases aggregated 4.3 million rsf. although this is lower than the 8.4 million rsf and 9.5 million rsf of leasing activity in 2022 and 2021, respectively, it is important to recognize that the years 2021-2022 represented an exceptional period due to the significant growth in demand fueled by strong capital markets. excluding these years, the 2023 leasing activity has normalized and was consistent with our historical annual average of 4.2 million rsf executed from 2013 to 2020.
•the weighted-average lease term for leases executed during 2023 was 11.3 years, exceeding the weighted-average lease term of 8.8 years achieved during 2014-2023.
•60% of our projects aggregating 5.7 million rsf that are primarily expected to be placed into service and stabilized during 2024-2027 are either leased or under negotiation;
•our projects expected to stabilize in 2024 are 93% pre-leased.
•operational excellence of our team. alexandria provides and demonstrates operational excellence in direct asset management and operations of our labspace® asset base. this high level of performance is crucial in helping to protect billions of dollars' worth of intensive infrastructure, specialized equipment, and invaluable tenant research and clinical assets. the demanding nature of laboratory-based scientific research requires strict adherence to safety standards set by local, state, and federal regulatory bodies. key compliance aspects include good manufacturing practice and clinical laboratory improvement amendments (clia) certifications, adherence to national biosafety level guidelines, proper permitting and handling of hazardous waste generation and chemical storage, maintenance of safety stations, effective management of ultra-low temperature freezers, and careful licensing and management of radioactive materials.
our team is composed of highly experienced, educated, and professionally credentialed facilities specialists. this expertise is essential in ensuring a secure and efficient environment for groundbreaking scientific research and has been cultivated and maintained over many years.
•strength of our brand. as a recognized leader in the life science and real estate sectors, alexandria has successfully built a diverse and high-quality tenant base. over the past 30 years, we have fostered longstanding relationships and strategic partnerships with our tenants, which have enabled us to maintain strong occupancy, leasing, and growth in net operating income and cash flows and to effectively navigate through various economic cycles. key indicators of our brand strength include:
•as of december 31, 2023, 76% of our leasing activity during the last twelve months was generated from our existing tenant base;
•as of december 31, 2023, 92% of our top 20 tenants annual rental revenue is derived from investment-grade or large-cap publicly traded companies, the highest in our 30-year history;
•strong occupancy of 94.6% as of december 31, 2023 and anticipated strong occupancy of 95.1% at the midpoint of our guidance range as of december 31, 2024; and
•our tenant collections have remained consistently high over the last three years, averaging 99.8% since the beginning of 2021 through december 31, 2023.
•life science fundamentals. we monitor market demand trends, particularly in the life science industry, to optimally align our property offerings with tenant requirements. the life science industry has shown strong long-term growth, fueled by multifaceted sources of funding, including private venture capital, biopharma r&d spend, government funding, and philanthropic support for biomedical innovation. our focus on high-quality labspace® assets in prime locations positions us to effectively capitalize on these ongoing trends:
•the r&d expenditures by u.s. publicly traded life science companies have shown consistent growth since 2014, nearly doubling in 2023 compared to 2014. 16 of the top 20 pharma r&d spenders (for the year 2022) are alexandria tenants.
•the sector's growth is further supported by substantial growth in government funding, with the nih's budget increasing by 25% in 2023 compared to 2019.
•although life science venture funding has declined compared to a peak in 2020-2022, it remains robust. in 2023, funding levels exceeded those achieved in each year from 2013 to 2019.
•cbre's "2024 u.s. life science outlook" report, published in january 2024, highlighted that "fda approvals of novel drugs in 2023 neared the second-highest annual total over the past 25 years." alexandria tenants were responsible for almost half of novel fda-approved therapies since 2013.
•prudent financial management. our strong and flexible balance sheet and prudent balance sheet management are key factors in our ability to navigate economic uncertainties and capitalize on new opportunities. the strength of our financial position is highlighted by several key indicators:
•our significant liquidity of $5.8 billion as of december 31, 2023 provides us the flexibility to address our operational needs and to pursue growth opportunities.
•we expect to have the ability to self-fund a large portion of our capital requirements through the following sources in 2024:
•$450 million in net cash provided by operating activities after dividends, at the midpoint of our guidance range for 2024;
•$1.2 billion in capital contributions to fund construction expected from our existing consolidated real estate joint venture partners from january 1, 2024 through 2027, including $430 million in 2024.
•$1.4 billion from dispositions of and sales of partial interests in real estate assets at the midpoint of our guidance range for 2024.
•as of december 31, 2023, our credit ratings from s&p global ratings and moody's investors service were bbb+ and baa1, respectively, which continued to rank in the top 10% among all publicly traded u.s. reits.
•as of december 31, 2023, our fixed-rate debt represents 98.1% of our total debt, which provides predictability in debt servicing costs.
•our debt maturity schedule is well laddered, with no debt maturing before april 2025. this provides us with financial flexibility and reduces short-term refinancing risks. as of december 31, 2023, 29% of our debt matures in 2049 or later and only 20% of our debt matures in the next 5 years.
•as of december 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining term of our debt is 12.8 years, demonstrating our strategic approach to debt management and focus on maintaining manageable annual debt maturities.
•our net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda ratio was 5.1x for the three months ended december 31, 2023 annualized, equaling the lowest leverage levels in company history.
execution of capital strategy
2023 capital strategy during 2023, we continued to execute on many of the long-term components of our capital strategy, as described below.
maintained access to diverse sources of capital strategically important to our long-term capital structure
•generated significant net cash flows from operating activities.
•in 2023, we funded $535.9 million of our equity capital needs with net cash flows from operating activities after dividends.
•continued strategic value harvesting through real estate dispositions, partial interest sales, and settlements of forward equity contracts.
•in 2023, sales primarily of real estate assets not integral to our mega campus strategy generated $1.3 billion of capital for investment into our highly leased development and redevelopment projects and strategic acquisitions. in connection with these transactions, we recorded gains or consideration in excess of book value aggregating $284.8 million.
•during the three months ended december 31, 2023, we settled our forward equity sales agreements that were outstanding as of december 31, 2022, by issuing 699 thousand shares of common stock, for which we received net proceeds of $104.3 million.
•in january 2024, our existing atm program became inactive upon expiration of the associated shelf registration. we expect to file a new shelf registration and atm program in the near future.
•achieved significant growth in annualized adjusted ebitda of $248.1 million, or 13%, for the three months ended december 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended december 31, 2022, which allowed us to:
•take advantage of a favorable capital market environment early in 2023 and opportunistically issue, on a leverage-neutral basis, unsecured senior notes payable aggregating $1.0 billion with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.95% and a weighted-average maturity of 21.2 years; and
•maintain our net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda ratio to 5.1x for the three months ended december 31, 2023, annualized.
strong and flexible balance sheet with significant liquidity, top 10% credit rating ranking among all publicly traded u.s. reits
•as of december 31, 2023, our credit ratings from s&p global ratings and moody's investors service were bbb+ and baa1, respectively, which continued to rank in the top 10% among all publicly traded u.s. reits.
•net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda of 5.1x, equaling the lowest leverage levels in company history, and fixed-charge coverage ratio of 4.5x for the three months ended december 31, 2023, annualized.
•significant liquidity of $5.8 billion.
•no debt maturities prior to 2025.
•only 20% of our total debt matures in the next five years.
•12.8 years weighted-average remaining term of debt.
•98.1% of our debt has a fixed rate.
•total debt and preferred stock to gross assets of 27%.
•$1.2 billion of expected capital contribution commitments from existing consolidated real estate joint venture partners to fund construction from january 1, 2024 through 2027.
key capital metrics as of or for the year ended december 31, 2023
•$33.1 billion in total market capitalization.
•$21.8 billion in total equity capitalization, which ranks in the top 10% among all publicly traded u.s. reits.
•non-real estate investments aggregating $1.4 billion:
•unrealized gains presented in our consolidated balance sheet were $196.9 million, comprising gross unrealized gains and losses aggregating $320.4 million and $123.5 million, respectively.
•investment loss of $195.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 presented in our consolidated statement of operations consisted of $201.5 million of unrealized losses and $6.1 million of realized gains, including $74.6 million of impairments.
2024 capital strategy during 2024, we intend to continue to execute our capital strategy to further strengthen our credit profile, which will allow us to further improve our cost of capital and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. consistent with 2023, our capital strategy for 2024 includes the following elements:
•allocate capital to class a/a+ properties located in life science, agtech, and advanced technology mega campuses in aaa innovation clusters.
•maintain prudent access to diverse sources of capital, which include net cash flows from operating activities after dividends, incremental leverage-neutral debt supported by growth in adjusted ebitda, strategic value harvesting and asset recycling through real estate disposition and partial interest sales, non-real estate investment sales, sales of equity, joint venture capital, and other sources of capital.
•continue to improve our credit profile.
•maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth.
•prudently ladder debt maturities and manage short-term variable-rate debt.
•prudently manage non-real estate equity investments to support corporate-level investment strategies.
•maintain a stable and flexible balance sheet with significant liquidity.
the anticipated delivery of significant incremental ebitda from our development and redevelopment of new class a/a+ properties is expected to enable us to continue to debt-fund a significant portion of our development and redevelopment projects on a leverage-neutral basis. we expect to continue to maintain access to diverse sources of capital, including unsecured senior notes payable and secured construction loans for our development and redevelopment projects from time to time. we expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of our net operating income on an unencumbered basis to allow for future flexibility for accessing both unsecured and secured debt markets, although we expect traditional secured mortgage notes payable will remain a small component of our capital structure. we intend to supplement our remaining capital needs with net cash flows from operating activities after dividends and proceeds from real estate asset sales, partial interest sales, and equity capital. for further information, refer to "projected results, sources of capital," and "uses of capital" within this item 7. our ability to meet our 2024 capital strategy objectives and expectations will depend in part on capital market conditions, real estate market conditions, and other factors beyond our control. accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these objectives and expectations. refer to our discussion of "forward-looking statements" under part i and "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k.

climate change we cannot predict the rate at which climate change will progress. however, the physical effects of climate change may potentially have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, and business. for example, most of our properties are located along the east and west coasts of the u.s. and some of our properties are located in close proximity to shorelines. to the extent that climate change impacts weather patterns, our markets could experience severe weather, including hurricanes, severe winter storms, wildfires, droughts, and coastal flooding due to increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels. over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for space at our properties, delays in construction and resulting increased construction costs, or our inability to operate the buildings at all. climate change and severe weather may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of, or decreasing the availability of, property insurance on terms we find acceptable, and by increasing the costs of energy, maintenance, repair of water and/or wind damage, and snow removal at our properties. we continue to evaluate our asset base for potential exposure to the following climate-related risks: sea level rise and increases in heavy rain, flood, drought, extreme heat, and wildfire.
we are monitoring considerations such as shifting market demands and regulation. as of december 31, 2023, 90% of alexandria's top 20 tenants (by annual rental revenue) have set net-zero carbon and/or carbon neutrality goals. from a policy and regulatory standpoint, the united nations' annual climate summit, cop28, held in november-december 2023 reaffirmed the goal to limit the global temperature rise to the crucial temperature threshold of 1.5°c. additionally, numerous states and municipalities have adopted state and local laws and policies on climate change, including climate disclosures and emission reduction targets impacting the building sector. for example, the state of california enacted legislation requiring certain companies to disclose ghg and climate-related financial risk information. further cities including boston, cambridge, new york, and seattle have passed ordinances that set limits on ghg emissions associated with building operations. some municipalities, including the cities of new york and san francisco, have also implemented legislation to eliminate the use of natural gas in new construction projects. refer to "we face possible risks and costs associated with the effects of climate change and severe weather" in "other factors" within "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
our approach to assessing and mitigating physical climate-related risk through our climate resilience roadmap, and transition risk through our ghg emissions mitigation strategy, are outlined below.
climate resilience roadmap we continue to assess potential physical risks associated with climate change, analyze climate data and property damage losses associated with past weather events, and review the potential for future climate hazards that are acute (increase in heavy rain events, droughts, floods, tropical cyclones, and wildfires) and those that are chronic (sea level rise and rising temperatures). we also consider local climate change vulnerability assessments and resilience planning efforts. our climate resilience roadmap uses climate models and scenario analyses to identify potential future hazards at the building level. furthermore, we conduct physical inspections to assess resilience and to determine whether additional mitigation is needed.
in our evaluation of physical risks, alexandria considers two climate change scenarios for 2030 and 2050: (i) a high-emissions scenario in which ghg emissions continue to increase with time (rcp 8.5); and (ii) an intermediate scenario in which ghg emissions level off by 2050 and decline thereafter (rcp 4.5). rcp 8.5 generally predicts more significant future climate hazard impacts than rcp 4.5.
after conducting an evaluation of the potential hazards out to year 2050, sites modeled to have high exposure to one or more climate hazards will undergo physical site inspections to assess their resilience to current and/or future stresses and to determine whether additional mitigation is needed.
for certain buildings, mitigation may include emergency preparedness, along with nominal capital improvement work. we may find that other buildings require more significant planning and investment to incorporate more complex resilience measures. resilience measures that may be necessary at some of our properties are described below.
in our operating properties located in areas prone to flooding, we may consider positioning critical building mechanical equipment on rooftops or significantly above the projected potential flood elevations, storing temporary flood barriers on site to be deployed at building entrances prior to a flood event, installing backflow preventers on stormwater/sewer utilities that discharge from the building, and waterproofing the building envelope up to the projected flood elevation.
in our operating properties located in areas prone to wildfire, we may consider implementing landscaping improvements to replace fire-prone materials and selecting fire-resistant vegetation to position at a reasonable distance from buildings.
for our developments and redevelopments of new class a/a+ properties, we will aim to design for climate resilience. in 2022, alexandria worked to further develop resilient design guidelines to mitigate potential exposures to future climate conditions identified in existing climate models. in accordance with such guidelines, we will endeavor to design buildings that incorporate materials, systems, and features to manage predicted climate hazards and maintain building operability during and after a climate event. as feasible, we will consider designs that accommodate potential expansion of cooling infrastructure to meet future building needs. in water-scarce areas, we will consider planting drought-resistant vegetation and equipping buildings to capture, treat, and reuse available water from building systems and precipitation events where feasible. in areas prone to wildfire, we will consider incorporating brush management practices into landscape design and including enhanced air filtration systems to support safe and healthy indoor air.
for acquisitions in our portfolio, we continue to use climate modeling as part of our due diligence in assessing potential risk and to inform our financial modeling and transactional decisions.
as a part of alexandria's risk management program, we maintain all-risk property insurance at the portfolio level, including properties under development, to help mitigate the risk of extreme weather events and potential impact from losses associated with natural catastrophes, such as flood, wildfire, and wind events. we leverage our climate mitigation strategy with property insurance carriers to help reduce our overall cost of risk. however, there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover all our potential losses and that climate change and severe weather will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, or business. for additional information on our risk management strategies related to insurance coverage, refer to "our insurance may not adequately cover all potential losses" in "operating factors" within "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k.
greenhouse gas emissions mitigation strategy we are developing a ghg emissions mitigation strategy that is closely aligned with the sustainability goals of many of our innovative tenants. our strategy will directly focus on reducing emissions from our operations through electrification, energy efficiency, and renewable electricity, and will indirectly focus on reducing emissions associated with construction activities through engaging with our supply chain and by targeting reductions in embodied carbon through procurement, as described below.
we have taken steps to incorporate electrification into some of our development projects, including at 230 harriet tubman way on our alexandria center® for life science - millbrae campus in our south san francisco submarket. we look for opportunities to utilize alternative energy sources. for example, we are using geothermal energy at our 325 binney street and 15 necco street developments in our greater boston region. we also aim to continue to increase our consumption of renewable electricity, including through our new solar power purchase agreement that will take effect in our greater boston region in 2024.
we aim to reduce emissions associated with construction activities. these activities may include such strategies as engaging with our supply chain and targeting reductions in embodied carbon through procurement. emissions within our indirect focus will require significant innovation and cost-effective solutions to develop pathways for substantial emissions reduction.
board of directors and leadership oversight the audit committee oversees the management of the company's financial and other systemic risks, including those related to climate change. at a management level, alexandria's sustainability committee, which comprises members of the executive management team and senior decision makers spanning the company's real estate development, asset management, risk management, and sustainability teams, leads the development and execution of our approach to climate-related risk.
refer to "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k for discussion of the risks we face from climate change.
results of operations we present a tabular comparison of items, whether gain or loss, that may facilitate a high-level understanding of our results and provide context for the disclosures included in this annual report on form 10-k. we believe that such tabular presentation promotes a better understanding for investors of the corporate-level decisions made and activities performed that significantly affect comparison of our operating results from period to period. we also believe that this tabular presentation will supplement for investors an understanding of our disclosures and real estate operating results. gains or losses on sales of real estate and impairments of assets classified as held for sale are related to corporate-level decisions to dispose of real estate. gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt are related to corporate-level financing decisions focused on our capital structure strategy. significant realized and unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, impairments of real estate and non-real estate investments, and acceleration of stock compensation expense due to the resignations of executive officers are not related to the operating performance of our real estate assets as they result from strategic, corporate-level non-real estate investment decisions and external market conditions. impairments of non-real estate investments are not related to the operating performance of our real estate as they represent the write-down of non-real estate investments when their fair values decrease below their respective carrying values due to changes in general market or other conditions outside of our control. significant items, whether a gain or loss, included in the tabular disclosure for current periods are described in further detail under this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k. key items included in net income attributable to alexandria's common stockholders for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related per share amounts were as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

income from rentals total income from rentals for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by $266.4 million, or 10.3%, to $2.8 billion, compared to $2.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, as a result of increase in rental revenues and tenant recoveries, as discussed below.
rental revenues total rental revenues for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by $193.9 million, or 9.9%, to $2.1 billion, compared to $2.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase was primarily due to an increase in rental revenues from our non-same properties related to 5.7 million rsf of development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to january 1, 2022 and 41 operating properties aggregating 4.2 million rsf acquired subsequent to january 1, 2022.
rental revenues from our same properties for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by $50.2 million, or 3.5%, to $1.5 billion, compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase was primarily due to rental rate increases on lease renewals and re-leasing of space since january 1, 2022.
tenant recoveries tenant recoveries for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by $72.5 million, or 11.6%, to $698.5 million, compared to $625.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2022. this increase was primarily from our non-same properties related to our development and redevelopment projects placed into service and properties acquired subsequent to january 1, 2022, as discussed above under "rental revenues."
same properties' tenant recoveries for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by $33.4 million, or 6.6%, to $537.7 million, compared to $504.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, primarily due to higher operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2023, as discussed under "rental operations" below. as of december 31, 2023, 94% of our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent.
other income other income for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was $43.2 million and $12.9 million, respectively, which primarily consisted of management fees and interest income earned during each respective period. the increase in other income was primarily due to a $5.3 million leasing fee related to a joint venture in our seattle market and an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in average interest rates earned from our money market accounts to over 4.0% during the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to less than 1.2% during the year ended december 31, 2022.
rental operations total rental operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by $76.0 million, or 9.7%, to $859.2 million, compared to $783.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase was primarily due to incremental expenses related to our non-same properties, which consisted of development and redevelopment projects placed into service and acquired properties, as discussed above under "rental revenues."
same properties' rental operating expenses increased by $37.2 million, or 6.3%, to $623.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to $586.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase was primarily the result of increases in (i) repair and maintenance expenses aggregating $9.3 million, primarily due to higher rates for services; (ii) property taxes aggregating $8.5 million, primarily due to annual property tax reassessments in our greater boston market and tax reassessments related to the formation of recent joint ventures in our san diego market; (iii) property insurance expenses aggregating $5.6 million, primarily due to increases in insurance premiums; and (iv) utilities expenses aggregating $3.7 million, primarily due to increases in rates.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by $22.1 million, or 12.5%, to $199.4 million, compared to $177.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, primarily as a result of the acceleration of stock-based compensation expense recognized in connection with the resignations of former executive officers dean a. shigenaga and john h. cunningham in 2023. refer to note 16 - "share-based compensation" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

we expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as requirements for development, redevelopment, other construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements, property acquisitions, leasing costs, non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, scheduled debt maturities, distributions to noncontrolling interests, and payment of dividends, through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, strategic real estate joint ventures, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, issuances under our commercial paper program, and issuances of additional debt and/or equity securities.
we also expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements, as further detailed in this section, generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make the distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a reit.
for additional information on our liquidity requirements related to our contractual obligations and commitments, refer to note 5 - "leases" and note 10 - "secured and unsecured senior debt" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k.
over the next several years, our balance sheet, capital structure, and liquidity objectives are as follows:
•retain cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests for investment in development and redevelopment projects and/or acquisitions;
•maintain significant balance sheet liquidity;
•improve credit profile and relative long-term cost of capital;
•maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash provided by operating activities, unsecured debt, secured debt, selective real estate asset sales, strategic real estate joint ventures, non-real estate investment sales, and common stock;
•maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;
•maintain prudent laddering of debt maturities;
•maintain solid credit metrics;
•prudently manage variable-rate debt exposure;
•maintain a large unencumbered asset pool to provide financial flexibility;
•fund common stock dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests from net cash provided by operating activities;
•manage a disciplined level of value-creation projects as a percentage of our gross real estate assets; and
•maintain high levels of pre-leasing and percentage leased in value-creation projects.

cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $660.8 million and $858.0 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from real estate asset sales, sales of partial interests, strategic real estate joint ventures, non-real estate investment sales, borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, issuances under our commercial paper program, issuances of unsecured senior notes payable, borrowings under our secured construction loans, and issuances of common stock to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, distributions to noncontrolling interests, scheduled debt repayments, acquisitions, and certain capital expenditures, including expenditures related to construction activities.
cash flows we report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. the following table summarizes changes in our cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):

operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our asset base, the rental rates of our leases, the collectibility of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, the timing of completion of development and redevelopment projects, and the timing of acquisitions and dispositions of operating properties. net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by $336.2 million to $1.6 billion, compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase was primarily attributable to the following since january 1, 2022: (i) cash flows generated from our highly leased development and redevelopment projects recently placed into service, (ii) income-producing acquisitions, and (iii) increases in rental rates on lease renewals and re-leasing of space.
investing activities cash used in investing activities for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following (in thousands):

(1)as of the date of this report, we have pending real estate dispositions subject to signed letters of intent or purchase and sale agreements aggregating $142.4 million.
(2)in january 2024, our existing atm program became inactive upon expiration of the associated shelf registration. we expect to file a new shelf registration and atm program in the near future.
(3)primarily represents strategic acquisitions that expand existing mega campuses or are associated with a new mega campus. we have completed acquisitions aggregating $103.3 million as of the date of this report.
(4)our guidance assumes we issue new unsecured senior notes payable in 2025 to fund the repayment of our $600 million unsecured senior notes payable due on april 30, 2025. subject to market conditions, we may seek opportunities in 2024 to fund the repayment of our 2025 debt maturity through the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes payable.
the key assumptions behind the sources and uses of capital in the table above include a favorable real estate transaction and capital market environments, performance of our core operating properties, lease-up and delivery of current and future development and redevelopment projects, and leasing activity. our expected sources and uses of capital are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed as "forward-looking statements" under part i; "item 1a. risk factors"; and "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in this annual report on form 10-k. we expect to update our forecast for key sources and uses of capital on a quarterly basis.
sources of capital net cash provided by operating activities after dividends we expect to retain $400.0 million to $500.0 million of net cash flows from operating activities after payment of common stock dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the year ending december 31, 2024. for purposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences. for the year ending december 31, 2024, we expect our recently delivered projects, our highly pre-leased value-creation projects expected to be delivered, contributions from same properties, and recently acquired income-producing properties to contribute increases in income from rentals, net operating income, and cash flows. we anticipate contractual near-term growth in annual net operating income (cash basis) of $114 million related to the commencement of contractual rents on the projects recently placed into service that are near the end of their initial free rent period. refer to the "cash flows" subsection of the "liquidity" section within this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2023.
debt we expect to fund a portion of our capital needs for 2024 from issuances under our commercial paper program, borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, and borrowings under our secured construction loans.
as of december 31, 2023, our unsecured senior line of credit has aggregate commitments of $5.0 billion and bears an interest rate of sofr plus 0.835%. in addition to the cost of borrowing, the unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.14% based on the aggregate commitments outstanding. based upon our ability to achieve certain annual sustainability targets, the interest rate and facility fee rate are also subject to upward or downward adjustments of up to four basis points with respect to the interest rate and up to one basis point with respect to the facility fee rate.
in june 2023, we amended our unsecured senior line of credit to increase the aggregate commitments available for borrowing to $5.0 billion from $4.0 billion.
during the three months ended march 31, 2023, we achieved certain annual sustainability targets, as described in our unsecured senior line of credit agreement, which reduced the borrowing rate by four basis points for a one-year period to sofr plus 0.835%, from sofr plus 0.875%, and reduced the facility fee by one basis point to 0.14% from 0.15%. as of december 31, 2023, we had no outstanding balance on our unsecured senior line of credit.
in july 2023, we increased the aggregate amount we may issue from time to time under our commercial paper program to $2.5 billion from $2.0 billion. our commercial paper program provides us with the ability to issue up to $2.5 billion of commercial paper notes with a maturity of generally 30 days or less and with a maximum maturity of 397 days from the date of issuance. our commercial paper program is backed by our unsecured senior line of credit, and at all times we expect to retain a minimum undrawn amount of borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit equal to any outstanding balance under our commercial paper program. we use borrowings under the program to fund short-term capital needs. the notes issued under our commercial paper program are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market. they are typically issued at a discount to par, representing a yield to maturity dictated by market conditions at the time of issuance. in the event we are unable to issue commercial paper notes or refinance outstanding commercial paper notes under terms equal to or more favorable than those under the unsecured senior line of credit, we expect to borrow under the unsecured senior line of credit. the commercial paper notes sold during the year ended december 31, 2023 were issued at a weighted-average yield to maturity of 5.55%. as of december 31, 2023, we had $100.0 million of commercial paper notes outstanding.
in february 2023, we opportunistically issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes payable with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.95% and a weighted-average maturity of 21.2 years. the unsecured senior notes consisted of $500.0 million of 4.75% unsecured senior notes due 2035 and $500.0 million of 5.15% unsecured senior notes due 2053.

real estate dispositions and sales of partial interests we expect to continue to focus on the disciplined execution of select sales of real estate. future sales will provide an important source of capital to fund a portion of pending and recently completed opportunistic acquisitions and our highly leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects, and also provide significant capital for growth. we may also consider additional sales of partial interests in core class a/a+ properties and/or development projects. for 2024, we expect real estate dispositions and sales of partial interests in real estate assets to range from $900 million to $1.9 billion. the amount of asset sales necessary to meet our forecasted sources of capital will vary depending upon the amount of ebitda associated with the assets sold.
refer to note 3 - "investments in real estate," note 4 - "consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures," and note 15 - "stockholders' equity" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 and "dispositions and sales of partial interests" under item 2 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on our real estate dispositions and sales of partial interests.
as a reit, we are generally subject to a 100% tax on the net income from real estate asset sales that the irs characterizes as "prohibited transactions." we do not expect our sales will be categorized as prohibited transactions. however, unless we meet certain "safe harbor" requirements, whether a real estate asset sale is a prohibited transaction will be based on the facts and circumstances of the sale. our real estate asset sales may not always meet such safe harbor requirements. refer to "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information about the "prohibited transaction" tax.
common equity transactions during the three months ended december 31, 2023, we settled our forward equity sales agreements that were outstanding as of december 31, 2022, by issuing 699 thousand shares of common stock, for which we received net proceeds of $104.3 million.
in january 2024, our existing atm program became inactive upon expiration of the associated shelf registration. we expect to file a new shelf registration and atm program in the near future.
other sources as a well-known seasoned issuer, from time to time, we may issue securities at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including, as necessary, to balance our use of incremental debt capital.
additionally, we, together with joint venture partners, hold interests in real estate joint ventures that we consolidate in our financial statements. these existing joint ventures provide significant equity capital to fund a portion of our future construction spend, and our joint venture partners may also contribute equity into these entities for financing-related activities. from january 1, 2024 through december 31, 2027, we expect to receive capital contributions aggregating $1.2 billion from existing consolidated real estate joint venture partners to fund construction. during the year ending december 31, 2024, contributions from noncontrolling interests from existing joint venture partners are expected to aggregate $430.0 million.
uses of capital summary of capital expenditures one of our primary uses of capital relates to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction of properties. we currently have projects in our value-creation pipeline aggregating 5.5 million rsf of class a/a+ properties undergoing construction and one near-term project expected to commence construction in the next two years, 2.1 million rsf of priority anticipated development and redevelopment projects, and 23.9 million sf of future development projects in north america. we incur capitalized construction costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and other construction activities. we also incur additional capitalized project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project, during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress. refer to the "new class a/a+ development and redevelopment properties: current projects" section under item 2 and "summary of capital expenditures" subsections of the "investments in real estate" section within this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k for more information on our capital expenditures.
we capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period in which activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. capitalized interest for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 of $364.0 million and $278.6 million, respectively, was classified in investments in real estate in our consolidated balance sheets. the increase in capitalized interest was related to the increase in weighted-average interest rate used to capitalize interest to 3.79% for the year ended december 31, 2023 from 3.51% for the year ended december 31, 2022, and a higher weighted-average capitalized cost basis of $9.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to $7.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022.
property taxes, insurance on real estate, and indirect project costs, such as construction, office, legal, and administration costs that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. we capitalized payroll and other indirect costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction projects, aggregating $108.4 million and $83.8 million, and property taxes, insurance on real estate and indirect project costs aggregating $129.1 million and $97.3 million during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
the increase in capitalized costs for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, was primarily due to an increase in our value-creation pipeline projects undergoing construction and pre-construction activities in 2023 over 2022. pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. the advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. these critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct and indirect project costs related to the asset would be expensed as incurred. expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. for example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately $60.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2023.
we use third-party brokers to assist in our leasing activity, who are paid on a contingent basis upon successful leasing. we are required to capitalize initial direct costs related to successful leasing transactions that result directly from and are essential to the lease transaction and would not have been incurred had that lease transaction not been successfully executed. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we capitalized total initial direct leasing costs of $75.3 million. costs that we incur to negotiate or arrange a lease regardless of its outcome, such as fixed employee compensation, tax, or legal advice to negotiate lease terms, and other costs, are expensed as incurred.
acquisitions as of december 31, 2023, the total purchase price of our pending acquisitions under executed letters of intent or purchase and sale agreements aggregated $462.0 million. we expect to complete these acquisitions within 12 months.
refer to the "acquisitions" section in note 3 - "investments in real estate" and to note 4 - "consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k, and the "acquisitions" subsection of the "investments in real estate" section under item 2 in this annual report on form 10-k for information on our acquisitions.
dividends during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we paid common stock dividends of $847.5 million and $757.7 million, respectively. the increase of $89.7 million in dividends paid on our common stock during the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to the year ended december 31, 2022, was primarily due to an increase in the number of common shares outstanding subsequent to january 1, 2022 as a result of issuances of common stock under our atm program and settlement of forward equity sales agreements, and partially due to the increase in the related dividends to $4.90 per common share paid during the year ended december 31, 2023 from $4.66 per common share paid during the year ended december 31, 2022.
secured notes payable secured notes payable as of december 31, 2023 consisted of three notes secured by two properties. our secured notes payable typically require monthly payments of principal and interest and had a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 8.37%. as of december 31, 2023, the total book value of our investments in real estate securing debt was approximately $330.9 million. as of december 31, 2023, our secured notes payable, including unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs, comprised approximately $619 thousand and $119.0 million of fixed-rate debt and unhedged variable-rate debt, respectively.

(1)all covenant ratio titles utilize terms as defined in the respective debt agreements.
(2)the calculation of consolidated ebitda is based on the definitions contained in our loan agreements and is not directly comparable to the computation of ebitda as described in exchange act release no. 47226.
in addition, the terms of the indentures, among other things, limit the ability of the company, alexandria real estate equities, l.p., and the company's subsidiaries to (i) consummate a merger, or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of the company's assets, and (ii) incur certain secured or unsecured indebtedness.

(1)all covenant ratio titles utilize terms as defined in the credit agreement.
estimated interest payments estimated interest payments on our fixed-rate debt are calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including interest payment dates and scheduled maturity dates. as of december 31, 2023, 98.1% of our debt was fixed-rate debt. for additional information regarding our debt, refer to note 10 - "secured and unsecured senior debt" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k.
ground lease obligations ground lease obligations as of december 31, 2023, included leases for 36 of our properties, which accounted for approximately 9% of our total number of properties. excluding one ground lease that expires in 2036 related to one operating property with a net book value of $5.7 million as of december 31, 2023, our ground lease obligations have remaining lease terms ranging from approximately 31 to 98 years, including available extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise.
operating lease agreements as of december 31, 2023, the remaining contractual payments under ground and office lease agreements in which we are the lessee aggregated $820.1 million and $28.8 million, respectively. we are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a related liability to account for our future obligations under operating lease arrangements in which we are the lessee. the operating lease liability is measured based on the present value of the remaining lease payments, including payments during the term under our extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. the right-of-use asset is equal to the corresponding operating lease liability, adjusted for the initial direct leasing cost and any other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease, as well as adjustments to reflect favorable or unfavorable terms of an acquired lease when compared with market terms at the time of acquisition. as of december 31, 2023, the present value of the remaining contractual payments, aggregating $848.9 million, under our operating lease agreements, including our extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, was $382.9 million, which was classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term of operating leases in which we are the lessee was approximately 41 years, and the weighted-average discount rate was 4.6%. our corresponding operating lease right-of-use assets, adjusted for initial direct leasing costs and other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease, aggregated $516.5 million. we classify the right-of-use asset in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. refer to the "lease accounting" section in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
commitments as of december 31, 2023, remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment, and improvements under the terms of leases approximated $1.9 billion. in addition, we may be required to incur construction costs associated with future development projects aggregating 643,331 rsf pursuant to an agreement whereby our counterparty may elect to execute future lease agreements on mutually agreeable terms.
we expect payments for these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. we may have the ability to cease the construction of certain projects, which would result in the reduction of our commitments. in addition, we have letters of credit and performance obligations aggregating $29.5 million primarily related to construction projects and an anticipated acquisition.
we are committed to funding approximately $413.6 million related to our non-real estate investments. these funding commitments are primarily associated with our investments in privately held entities that report nav and expire at various dates over the next 11 years, with a weighted-average expiration of 8.2 years as of december 31, 2023.
exposure to environmental liabilities in connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained phase i environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. the phase i environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the phase i environmental assessments were completed. in addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties.

inflation as of december 31, 2023, approximately 94% of our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. approximately 96% of our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other indices. accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flows or earnings from real estate operations are subject to significant risks from inflation. a period of inflation, however, could cause an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program, issuances of unsecured senior notes payable, and borrowings under our secured construction loans, and secured loans held by our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.
in addition, refer to "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion about risks that inflation directly or indirectly may pose to our business.

critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. we base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
we continually evaluate the estimates, judgments, and assumptions we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. changes in estimates, judgments, or assumptions could affect our financial position and our results of operations, which are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance.
our critical accounting estimates are defined as accounting estimates or assumptions made in accordance with gaap, which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty or subjectivity and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. our significant accounting policies, which utilize these critical accounting estimates, are described in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k. our critical accounting estimates are described below.
recognition of real estate acquired generally, our acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate are accounted for as asset acquisitions and not business combinations because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., land, buildings, and related intangible assets). the accounting model for asset acquisitions requires that the acquisition consideration (including acquisition costs) be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the sum of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values.
we assess the relative fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on:
(i)available comparable market information;
(ii)estimated replacement costs; or
(iii)discounted cash flow analysis/estimated net operating income and capitalization rates.
in certain instances, we may use multiple valuation techniques and estimate fair values based on an average of multiple valuation results. we exercise judgement to determine key assumptions used in each valuation technique. for example, to estimate future cash flows in the discounted cash flow analysis, we are required to use judgment and make a number of assumptions, including those related to projected growth in rental rates and operating expenses, and anticipated trends and market/economic conditions. the use of different assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis can affect the amount of consideration allocated to the acquired depreciable/amortizable asset, which in turn can impact our net income due to the recognition of the related depreciation/amortization expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
we completed acquisitions of five properties for a total purchase price of $259.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2023. these transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. refer to the "investments in real estate" section in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
impairment of long-lived assets impairment of real estate assets classified as held for sale a property is classified as held for sale when all of the accounting criteria for a plan of sale have been met. these criteria are described in the "investments in real estate" section in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k. upon classification as held for sale, we recognize an impairment charge, if necessary, to lower the carrying amount of the real estate asset to its estimated fair value less cost to sell. the determination of fair value can involve significant judgments and assumptions. we develop key assumptions based on the following available factors: (i) contractual sales price, (ii) preliminary non-binding letters of intent, or (iii) other available comparable market information. if this information is not available, we use estimated replacement costs or estimated cash flow projections that utilize estimated discount and capitalization rates. these estimates are subject to uncertainty and therefore require significant judgment by us. we review all assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to their estimated fair values less costs to sell. subsequently, as a result of our quarterly assessment, we may recognize an incremental impairment charge for any decrease in the asset's fair value less cost to sell. conversely, we may recognize a gain for a subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, limited to the cumulative net loss previously recognized.
impairment of other long-lived assets for each reporting period, we review current activities and changes in the business conditions of all of our long-lived assets, including our rental properties, cip, land held for development, right-of-use assets related to operating leases in which we are the lessee, and intangibles, to determine the existence of any triggering events or impairment indicators requiring an impairment analysis. if triggering events or impairment indicators are identified, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.
long-lived assets to be held and used, are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. triggering events or impairment indicators for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, cip, land held for development, and intangibles, are assessed by project and include significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other market factors. we assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market information, current and historical operating results, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the property, and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.
upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. if an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation or amortization is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the asset is expected to be held and used. we may also adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.
the evaluation for impairment and calculation of the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used involves consideration of factors and calculations that are different than the estimate of fair value of assets classified as held for sale. because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale.
impairment of non-real estate investments we hold strategic investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science, agtech, and technology industries. as a reit, we generally limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10%.
our investments in privately held entities that do not report nav per share require our evaluation for impairment when changes in these entities' conditions may indicate that an impairment exists. we closely monitor these investments throughout the year for new developments, including operating results, prospects and results of clinical trials, new product initiatives, new collaborative agreements, capital-raising events, and merger and acquisition activities. we evaluate these investees on the basis of a qualitative assessment for indicators of impairment by monitoring the presence of the following triggering events or impairment indicators: (i) a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee; (ii) a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, (iii) a significant adverse change in the general market condition, including the research and development of technology and products that the investee is bringing or attempting to bring to the market, (iv) significant concerns about the investee's ability to continue as a going concern, and/or (v) a decision by investors to cease providing support to reduce their financial commitment to the investee. if such indicators are present, we are required to estimate the investment's fair value and immediately recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the investment's carrying value in excess of its estimated fair value. as of each december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the carrying amounts of our investments in privately held entities that do not report nav per share accounted for approximately 1% to 2% of our total assets and aggregated $542.9 million, $582.7 million, and $491.3 million, respectively. during the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recognized impairment charges aggregating 14%, 4%, and 0%, respectively, of the carrying amounts of our investments in privately held entities that do not report nav.
monitoring of tenant credit quality we monitor, on an ongoing basis, the credit quality and any related material changes of our tenants by (i) monitoring the credit rating of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses and industries in which they conduct business, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease payments. we have a team of employees who, among them, have an extensive educational background or experience in biology, chemistry, industrial biotechnology, agtech, and the life science industry, as well as knowledge in finance. this team is responsible for timely assessment, monitoring, and communication of our tenants' credit quality and any material changes therein. during the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, specific write-offs and increases to our general allowance related to deferred rent balances of tenants recognized in our consolidated statements of operations have not exceeded 0.8% of our income from rentals for each respective year. for additional information, refer to the "monitoring of tenant credit quality" section in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
non-gaap measures and definitions this section contains additional information of certain non-gaap financial measures including reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and the reasons why we use these supplemental measures of performance and believe they provide useful information to investors, as well as the definitions of other terms used in this annual report on form 10-k.
funds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted, attributable to alexandria real estate equities, inc.'s common stockholders gaap-basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish over time. in an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the nareit board of governors established funds from operations as an improved measurement tool. since its introduction, funds from operations has become a widely used non-gaap financial measure among equity reits. we believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity reit. moreover, we believe that funds from operations, as adjusted, allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies on a consistent basis, without having to account for differences recognized because of real estate acquisition and disposition decisions, financing decisions, capital structure, capital market transactions, variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control, or other corporate activities that may not be representative of the operating performance of our properties.
the 2018 white paper published by the nareit board of governors (the "nareit white paper") defines funds from operations as net income (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains or losses on sales of real estate, and impairments of real estate, plus depreciation and amortization of operating real estate assets, and after adjustments for our share of consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and real estate joint ventures. impairments represent the write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability period is less than the carrying value due to changes in general market conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating performance of the properties during the corresponding period.
we compute funds from operations, as adjusted, as funds from operations calculated in accordance with the nareit white paper, excluding significant gains, losses, and impairments realized on non-real estate investments, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, significant termination fees, acceleration of stock compensation expense due to the resignations of executive officers, deal costs, the income tax effect related to such items, and the amount of such items that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards. we compute the amount that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards using the two-class method. under the two-class method, we allocate net income (after amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests) to common stockholders and to unvested restricted stock awards by applying the respective weighted-average shares outstanding during each quarter-to-date and year-to-date period. this may result in a difference of the summation of the quarter-to-date and year-to-date amounts. neither funds from operations nor funds from operations, as adjusted, should be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with gaap) as indications of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with gaap) as measures of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure of our operations, for financial and operational decision-making, and as a supplemental means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. adjusted ebitda is calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("ebitda"), excluding stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, impairments of real estate, and significant termination fees. adjusted ebitda also excludes unrealized gains or losses and significant realized gains or losses and impairments that result from our non-real estate investments. these non-real estate investment amounts are classified in our consolidated statements of operations outside of total revenues.
we believe adjusted ebitda provides investors with relevant and useful information as it allows investors to evaluate the operating performance of our business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of investing and financing decisions related to our real estate and non-real estate investments, our capital structure, capital market transactions, and variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control. for example, we exclude gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt to allow investors to measure our performance independent of our indebtedness and capital structure. we believe that adjusting for the effects of impairments and gains or losses on sales of real estate, significant impairments and realized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, and significant termination fees allows investors to evaluate performance from period to period on a consistent basis without having to account for differences recognized because of investing and financing decisions related to our real estate and non-real estate investments or other corporate activities that may not be representative of the operating performance of our properties.
in addition, we believe that excluding charges related to stock compensation and unrealized gains or losses facilitates for investors a comparison of our business activities across periods without the volatility resulting from market forces outside of our control. adjusted ebitda has limitations as a measure of our performance. adjusted ebitda does not reflect our historical expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. while adjusted ebitda is a relevant measure of performance, it does not represent net income (loss) or cash flows from operations calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity.
in order to calculate the adjusted ebitda margin, we divide adjusted ebitda by total revenues as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. we believe that this supplemental performance measure provides investors with additional useful information regarding the profitability of our operating activities.
we are not able to forecast fourth quarter net income without unreasonable effort and therefore do not provide a reconciliation for adjusted ebitda on a forward-looking basis. this is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and/or amount of items that depend on market conditions outside of our control, including the timing of dispositions, capital events, and financing decisions, as well as quarterly components such as gain on sales of real estate, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, impairment of real estate, and impairment of non-real estate investments. our attempt to predict these amounts may produce significant but inaccurate estimates, which would be potentially misleading for our investors.
the following table reconciles net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, to adjusted ebitda and calculates the adjusted ebitda margin for the three months and years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in thousands):

annual rental revenue annual rental revenue represents the annualized fixed base rental obligations, calculated in accordance with gaap, for leases in effect as of the end of the period, related to our operating rsf. annual rental revenue is presented using 100% of the annual rental revenue from our consolidated properties and our share of annual rental revenue for our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. annual rental revenue per rsf is computed by dividing annual rental revenue by the sum of 100% of the rsf of our consolidated properties and our share of the rsf of properties held in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. as of december 31, 2023, approximately 94% of our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. annual rental revenue excludes these operating expenses recovered from our tenants. amounts recovered from our tenants related to these operating expenses, along with base rent, are classified in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations.
capitalization rates capitalization rates are calculated based on net operating income and net operating income (cash basis) annualized, excluding lease termination fees, on stabilized operating assets for the quarter preceding the date on which the property is sold, or near-term prospective net operating income.
capitalized interest we capitalize interest cost as a cost of a project during periods for which activities necessary to develop or redevelop a project for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. activities necessary to develop or redevelop a project include pre-construction activities such as entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. the advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. these critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. if we cease activities necessary to prepare a project for its intended use, interest costs related to such project are expensed as incurred.
cash interest cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with gaap plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts). refer to the definition of "fixed-charge coverage ratio" in this section within this item 7 in this annual report on 10-k for a reconciliation of interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, to cash interest.
class a/a+ properties and aaa locations class a/a+ properties are properties clustered in aaa locations that provide innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. class a/a+ properties generally command higher annual rental rates than other classes of similar properties.
aaa locations are in close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. such locations are generally characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space.
development, redevelopment, and pre-construction a key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new class a/a+ properties, and property enhancements identified during the underwriting of certain acquired properties, located in collaborative life science, agtech, and advanced technology mega campuses in aaa innovation clusters. these projects are generally focused on providing high-quality, generic, and reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of a wide range of tenants. upon completion, each value-creation project is expected to generate increases in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. our development and redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value.
development projects generally consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable laboratory facilities. redevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of acquired office, warehouse, or shell space into laboratory, agtech, or advanced technology space. we generally will not commence new development projects for aboveground construction of new class a/a+ laboratory, agtech, and advanced technology space without first securing significant pre-leasing for such space, except when there is solid market demand for high-quality class a/a+ properties.
priority anticipated projects are those most likely to commence future ground-up development or first-time conversion from non-laboratory space to laboratory space prior to our other future projects, pending market conditions and leasing negotiations.
pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. the advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. these critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. ultimately, these projects will provide high-quality facilities and are expected to generate significant revenue and cash flows.
development, redevelopment, and pre-construction spending also includes the following costs: (i) amounts to bring certain acquired properties up to market standard and/or other costs identified during the acquisition process (generally within two years of acquisition) and (ii) permanent conversion of space for highly flexible, move-in-ready laboratory space to foster the growth of promising early- and growth-stage life science companies.
revenue-enhancing and repositioning capital expenditures represent spending to reposition or significantly change the use of a property, including through improvement in the asset quality from class b to class a/a+.
non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures represent costs required to maintain the current revenues of a stabilized property, including the associated costs for renewed and re-leased space.
dividend payout ratio (common stock)
dividend payout ratio (common stock) is the ratio of the absolute dollar amount of dividends on our common stock (shares of common stock outstanding on the respective record dates multiplied by the related dividend per share) to funds from operations attributable to alexandria's common stockholders - diluted, as adjusted.
dividend yield dividend yield for the quarter represents the annualized quarter dividend divided by the closing common stock price at the end of the quarter.
fixed-charge coverage ratio fixed-charge coverage ratio is a non-gaap financial measure representing the ratio of adjusted ebitda to cash interest and fixed charges. we believe that this ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy fixed financing obligations and preferred stock dividends. cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with gaap plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts).

initial stabilized yield (unlevered)
initial stabilized yield is calculated as the estimated amounts of net operating income at stabilization divided by our investment in the property. our initial stabilized yield excludes the benefit of leverage. our cash rents related to our value-creation projects are generally expected to increase over time due to contractual annual rent escalations. our estimates for initial stabilized yields, initial stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the project. we expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner if there are significant changes to the expected project yields or costs.
•initial stabilized yield reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the term(s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis.
•initial stabilized yield (cash basis) reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have elapsed and our total cash investment in the property.
investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represent tenants that are investment-grade rated or publicly traded companies with an average daily market capitalization greater than $10 billion for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, as reported by bloomberg professional services. credit ratings from moody's investors service and s&p global ratings reflect credit ratings of the tenant's parent entity, and there can be no assurance that a tenant's parent entity will satisfy the tenant's lease obligation upon such tenant's default. we monitor the credit quality and related material changes of our tenants. material changes that cause a tenant's market capitalization to decrease below $10 billion, which are not immediately reflected in the twelve-month average, may result in their exclusion from this measure.

joint venture financial information we present components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures, which are not presented, or intended to be presented, in accordance with gaap. we present the proportionate share of certain financial line items as follows: (i) for each real estate joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, which are controlled by us through contractual rights or majority voting rights, but of which we own less than 100%, we apply the noncontrolling interest economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at the amount of such cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component presented; and (ii) for each real estate joint venture that we do not control and do not consolidate, and are instead controlled jointly or by our joint venture partners through contractual rights or majority voting rights, we apply our economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented.
the components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures do not represent our legal claim to those items. for each entity that we do not wholly own, the joint venture agreement generally determines what equity holders can receive upon capital events, such as sales or refinancing, or in the event of a liquidation. equity holders are normally entitled to their respective legal ownership of any residual cash from a joint venture only after all liabilities, priority distributions, and claims have been repaid or satisfied.
we believe that this information can help investors estimate the balance sheet and operating results information related to our partially owned entities. presenting this information provides a perspective not immediately available from consolidated financial statements and one that can supplement an understanding of the joint venture assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in our consolidated results.
the components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures are limited as an analytical tool as the overall economic ownership interest does not represent our legal claim to each of our joint ventures' assets, liabilities, or results of operations. in addition, joint venture financial information may include financial information related to the unconsolidated real estate joint ventures that we do not control. we believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results and our total assets and liabilities, joint venture financial information should be examined in conjunction with our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets. joint venture financial information should not be considered an alternative to our consolidated financial statements, which are presented and prepared in accordance with gaap.

net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of evaluating our balance sheet leverage. net debt and preferred stock is equal to the sum of total consolidated debt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, plus preferred stock outstanding as of the end of the period. refer to the definition of "adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin" within this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the calculation of adjusted ebitda.
we are not able to forecast fourth quarter net income without unreasonable effort and therefore do not provide a reconciliation for net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda ratio on a forward-looking basis. this is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing of dispositions, capital events, and financing decisions, as well as quarterly components such as gain on sales of real estate, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, impairment of real estate, and impairment of non-real estate investments. our attempt to predict these amounts may produce significant but inaccurate estimates, which would be potentially misleading for our investors.

net operating income is a non-gaap financial measure calculated as net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, excluding equity in the earnings of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairments of real estate, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, and investment income or loss. we believe net operating income provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. therefore, we believe net operating income is a useful measure for investors to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated real estate assets. net operating income on a cash basis is net operating income adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease revenue adjustments required by gaap. we believe that net operating income on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent revenue and the amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases.
furthermore, we believe net operating income is useful to investors as a performance measure of our consolidated properties because, when compared across periods, net operating income reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, which provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. net operating income can be used to measure the initial stabilized yields of our properties by calculating net operating income generated by a property divided by our investment in the property. net operating income excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. in addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort comparability of operating performance at the property level. impairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving net operating income because we do not consider impairments of real estate to be property-level operating expenses. impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. our impairments of real estate represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. these impairments result from investing decisions or a deterioration in market conditions. we also exclude realized and unrealized investment gain or loss, which results from investment decisions that occur at the corporate level related to non-real estate investments in publicly traded companies and certain privately held entities. therefore, we do not consider these activities to be an indication of operating performance of our real estate assets at the property level. our calculation of net operating income also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to corporate strategy. property operating expenses included in determining net operating income primarily consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs, and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. general and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, rent, and supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. we calculate operating margin as net operating income divided by total revenues.
we believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results, net operating income should be examined in conjunction with net income or loss as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss as an indication of our performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity or our ability to make distributions.
operating statistics we present certain operating statistics related to our properties, including number of properties, rsf, occupancy percentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations as of the end of the period. we believe these measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of certain trends for our properties. we compute the number of properties, rsf, occupancy percentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations at 100% for all properties in which we have an investment, including properties owned by our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. for operating metrics based on annual rental revenue, refer to the definition of "annual rental revenue" in this "non-gaap measures and definitions" section within this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k.
same property comparisons as a result of changes within our total property portfolio during the comparative periods presented, including changes from assets acquired or sold, properties placed into development or redevelopment, and development or redevelopment properties recently placed into service, the consolidated total income from rentals, as well as rental operating expenses in our operating results, can show significant changes from period to period. in order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations over a given quarterly or annual period, we analyze the operating performance for all consolidated properties that were fully operating for the entirety of the comparative periods presented, referred to as same properties. we separately present quarterly and year-to-date same property results to align with the interim financial information required by the sec in our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. these same properties are analyzed separately from properties acquired subsequent to the first day in the earliest comparable quarterly or year-to-date period presented, properties that underwent development or redevelopment at any time during the comparative periods, unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, properties classified as held for sale, and corporate entities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from same property results. additionally, termination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of same properties. refer to "same properties" within this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
stabilized occupancy date the stabilized occupancy date represents the estimated date on which the project is expected to reach occupancy of 95% or greater.
tenant recoveries tenant recoveries represent revenues comprising reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses and earned in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred and the tenant's obligation to reimburse us arises.
we classify rental revenues and tenant recoveries generated through the leasing of real estate assets within revenues in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations. we provide investors with a separate presentation of rental revenues and tenant recoveries in the "comparison of results for the year ended december 31, 2023 to the year ended december 31, 2022" subsection of the "results of operations" section within this item 7 because we believe it promotes investors' understanding of our operating results. we believe that the presentation of tenant recoveries is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to recover operating expenses under our triple net leases, including recoveries of utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, property taxes, common area expenses, and other operating expenses, and of our ability to mitigate the effect to net income for any significant variability to components of our operating expenses.

unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income is a non-gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a performance measure of the results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets as it reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. unencumbered net operating income is derived from assets classified in continuing operations, which are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security interest, as of the period for which income is presented.

costs and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading "segment operating results."
consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to increases in the amortization of software and theme park depreciation.
amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the sky transaction in 2018 and the nbcuniversal transaction in 2011.
comcast 2023 annual report on form 10-k consolidated goodwill and long-lived asset impairments included charges related to sky totaling $8.6 billion in 2022 recognized in connection with our annual impairment assessment. the impairments primarily reflected an increased discount rate and reduced estimated future cash flows as a result of macroeconomic conditions. see "critical accounting estimates" and note 10 for further discussion.
consolidated interest expense increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding and higher weighted-average interest rates, partially offset by increased capitalized interest.
consolidated investment and other income (loss), net increased in 2023 compared to 2022.

the change in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to our investment in atairos. the income (losses) at atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income (loss) of $1.1 billion and $(434) million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to losses on marketable securities in the prior year, partially offset by losses on nonmarketable securities in the current year. the change in other income (loss), net in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily resulted from gains on foreign exchange remeasurement compared to losses in the prior year, gains on insurance contracts compared to losses in the prior year, and increased interest income.
consolidated income tax expense our effective income tax rate in 2023 and 2022 was 26.2% and 47.0%, respectively. our effective income tax rate for 2022 was impacted by the goodwill impairment, which was primarily not deductible for tax purposes. see note 5 for additional information on our effective income tax rate.
the increase in income tax expense in 2023 was primarily driven by higher income before income taxes and the effect of a change in our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of state tax law changes, which resulted in a $286 million benefit in the prior year.
consolidated net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests the changes in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to decreases in losses at universal beijing resort (see note 8), partially offset by increases in losses in our xumo streaming platform joint venture in the current year.

(a)our adjusted ebitda margin is adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue. we believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses and improving overall operating cost management. change in adjusted ebitda margin reflects the year-over-year basis point change.
(b)constant currency is a non-gaap financial measure. refer to the "non-gaap financial measures" section on page 47 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of constant currency amounts.
we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin connectivity businesses while managing overall operating costs. we also continue to invest in our network to support higher-speed broadband offerings and to expand the number of homes and businesses passed. an increasingly competitive environment and continued low domestic household move levels have had negative impacts on our customer relationships additions/(losses). we believe our residential connectivity revenue will increase as a result of growth in average domestic broadband revenue per customer, as well as increases in domestic wireless and international connectivity revenue. at the same time, we expect continued declines in video revenue as a result of domestic customer net losses due to shifting video consumption patterns and the competitive environment, although customer net losses typically mitigate the impact of continued rate increases on programming expenses. we also expect continued declines in other revenue related to declines in wireline voice revenue. we believe our business services connectivity segment will continue to grow by offering competitive services, including to medium-sized and enterprise customers. global economic conditions and consumer sentiment have in the past, and may continue to, adversely impact demand for our products and services and our results of operations.

(a)residential connectivity & platforms customer relationships generally represent the number of residential customer locations that subscribe to at least one of our services. international residential connectivity & platforms customer relationships represent customers receiving sky services in the united kingdom and italy. previously reported total sky customer relationships of approximately 23 million as of december 31, 2022 also included approximately 5 million customer relationships receiving sky services in germany now included in corporate and other. because each of our services includes a variety of product tiers, which may change from time to time, net additions or losses in any one period will reflect a mix of customers at various tiers.
(b)business services connectivity customer metrics are generally counted based on the number of locations receiving services, including locations within our network in the united states, as well as locations outside of our network both in the united states and internationally. certain arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our network are also generally counted based on the number of locations served.
(c)domestic wireless lines represent the number of residential and business customers' wireless devices. an individual customer relationship may have multiple wireless lines.
(d)customer metrics for 2022 and 2021 have been updated to reflect the new segment presentation, and to align methodologies for counting business customer metrics to: (1) include locations receiving our services outside of our distribution system and (2) now count certain customers based on the number of locations receiving services, including arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our distribution system. these changes in methodology resulted in increases of 161,000 and 175,000 relationships as of december 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. these changes in methodology were not material to any period presented.
(e)connectivity & platforms domestic homes and businesses are considered passed if we can connect them to our network in the united states without further extending the transmission lines. homes and businesses passed is an estimate based on the best available information.
(f)penetration is calculated by dividing the number of domestic customers located within our network by the number of domestic homes and businesses passed.

average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business customers, as well as changes in advertising and other revenue and in foreign currency exchange rates. while revenue from our individual service offerings is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. each of our services has a different contribution to adjusted ebitda margin. we use average monthly adjusted ebitda per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. we believe both metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business, and average monthly adjusted ebitda per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses.

we operate our media segment as a combined television and streaming business. we expect that the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our linear television networks will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns, which we aim to mitigate over time by continued growth in paid subscribers and advertising revenue at peacock. we expect to continue to incur significant costs related to additional content and marketing at peacock. revenue and programming expenses are also impacted by the timing of certain sporting events, including the olympics, super bowl and fifa world cup in 2022. global economic conditions and consumer sentiment have in the past, and may continue to, adversely impact demand for our products and services and our results of operations.
comcast 2023 annual report on form 10-k our studios segment generates revenue primarily from third parties and from licensing content to our media segment. while results of operations for our studios segment are not impacted, results for our total content & experiences business may be impacted as the studios segment licenses content to the media segment, including for peacock, rather than licensing the content to third parties. the writers guild of america and the sag work stoppages from may to september 2023 and july to november 2023, respectively, paused productions, which primarily resulted in reduced content licensing revenue at our studios segment and reduced programming and production costs at both our studios and media segments.
we continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including epic universe in orlando, as well as in new destinations and experiences, which we believe will have a positive impact on attendance and guest spending at our theme parks. our results in prior periods were impacted by temporary restrictions and closures at our international theme parks due to covid-19.

non-gaap financial measures consolidated adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. it is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. our management and board of directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. additionally, we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.

constant currency constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-gaap financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. certain of our businesses, including connectivity & platforms, have operations outside the united states that are conducted in local currencies. as a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in u.s. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. in our connectivity & platforms business, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the businesses, and we believe they are helpful for investors because such measures present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to allow the evaluation of their underlying performance.
constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current year period presented rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective periods.

our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. refer to the "contractual obligations" discussion below for additional information regarding our cash requirements. we anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets, investing in business opportunities, and returning capital to shareholders.
we maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. our commercial paper program generally provides a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. as of december 31, 2023, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11.0 billion.
we are subject to customary covenants and restrictions set forth in agreements related to debt issued at comcast and certain of our subsidiaries, including the indentures governing our public debt securities and the credit agreement governing the comcast revolving credit facility. our credit facility contains a financial covenant pertaining to leverage, which is the ratio of debt to ebitda, as defined in the credit facility. compliance with this financial covenant is tested on a quarterly basis under the terms of the credit facility. as of december 31, 2023, we met this financial covenant by a significant margin, and we expect to remain in compliance with this financial covenant and other covenants related to our debt. the covenants and restrictions in our revolving credit facility do not apply to certain entities, including sky and our international theme parks.

the variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2023 was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, including reduced spending due to the work stoppages and the timing of sports, and the timing of deferred revenue, as well as increases in accounts receivable, partially offset by higher accruals related to severance in 2022 compared to 2023.
the increase in payments of interest in 2023 was primarily due to increased debt balances following debt issuances in the current year, cash proceeds from the early settlement of interest rate swaps related to our collateralized obligation in the prior year and higher weighted-average interest rates.
the decrease in income tax payments in 2023 was primarily due to higher payments in the prior year relating to the preceding tax year, partially offset by higher taxable income in the current year. income tax payments related to the sale of our investment in hulu will primarily be made in 2024.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased in 2023 primarily due to net proceeds received as an advance on the sale of our interest in hulu (see note 8) and decreased purchases of short-term investments in the current year. these decreases were partially offset by increased capital expenditures and decreased proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments.
we expect to receive additional proceeds for the sale of our interest in hulu in 2024 following the finalization of the third-party appraisal process, at which time we will recognize the sale of our interest. see note 8.
comcast 2023 annual report on form 10-k         50
in september 2023, we entered into an agreement with t-mobile to sell certain of our spectrum licenses. the agreement provides us with a right to remove certain licenses from the transaction, which will result in total cash consideration between $1.2 billion and $3.3 billion. the sale is expected to close in 2028 subject to various conditions and approvals.
capital expenditures capital expenditures increased in 2023 primarily due to increased spending on the development of the epic universe theme park in orlando, $271 million associated with the acquisition of land for potential theme park expansion opportunities and increased spending in the connectivity & platforms business. the costs associated with the construction of universal beijing resort are presented separately in our consolidated statements of cash flows. see note 8.
our most significant capital expenditures are within the connectivity & platforms business, and we expect that this will continue in the future. connectivity & platforms' capital expenditures increased primarily due to increased spending on line extensions and scalable infrastructure, partially offset by decreased spending on customer premise equipment and support capital. the table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our segments in the connectivity & platforms business in 2023, 2022 and 2021.

we expect our capital expenditures in 2024 will continue to be focused on investments in line extensions for the expansion of both business services and residential passings in the connectivity & platforms business, in scalable infrastructure as we increase capacity and continue to execute our plans to upgrade our network to deliver multigigabit speeds, and in the continued deployment of wireless gateways. in addition, we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our universal theme parks, including the development of epic universe. capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased in 2023 primarily due to repayment of a collateralized obligation in the current year (see note 8), higher repurchases and repayments of debt, repayments of short-term borrowings, net in the current year compared to proceeds from short-term borrowings, net in the prior year, and higher settlements of derivative contracts in the prior year, which are included in other financing activities. these increases were partially offset by higher proceeds from borrowings in the current year and a decrease in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans.
in may 2023, we issued $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes maturing between 2029 and 2064, of which $2.9 billion was used to purchase senior notes maturing in 2024 and 2025. in february 2023, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes maturing in 2033 and an amount equal to the net proceeds from this issuance is intended to finance or refinance one or more green projects, assets or activities that meet certain specified eligibility criteria.
in 2023, we also had net repayments of $660 million under our commercial paper program and made total debt repayments of $4.0 billion, including the $2.9 billion purchase of senior notes.
we have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. see notes 6 and 8 for additional information on our financing activities.
comcast 2023 annual report on form 10-k share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. in 2023, we repurchased a total of 262 million shares of our class a common stock for $11.0 billion under the share repurchase program authorization of $20 billion approved by our board of directors in september 2022. we did not purchase any shares outside of the program. as of december 31, 2023, we had $5.0 billion remaining under the authorization, and in january 2024, our board of directors terminated the existing program and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $15 billion, which has no expiration date. we expect to repurchase additional shares of our class a common stock under this new program in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market and other conditions.
in 2023, our board of directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.29 per share, including our fourth quarter dividend payable in january 2024 and we made dividend payments of $4.8 billion. in january 2024, our board of directors approved a 6.9% increase in our dividend to $1.24 per share on an annualized basis and approved our first quarter dividend of $0.31 per share, to be paid in april 2024. we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our board of directors.
the chart below summarizes share repurchases and dividend payments. in addition, we paid $291 million, $321 million and $674 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. our share repurchases have more than offset dilution that resulted from issuing our class a common stock in connection with our share-based compensation plans in those years, thereby having the effect of reducing the total number of our class a common stock outstanding.

(a) amounts represent the face value of debt and exclude interest payments.
our largest contractual obligations relate to our outstanding debt. as of december 31, 2023, our debt had a weighted-average time to maturity of approximately 16 years. including the effects of our derivative financial instruments, as of december 31, 2023, our debt had a weighted-average interest rate based on the stated coupons of 3.6% and the percentage of our debt obligations that were fixed-rate debt was 97%. we typically fund and expect to continue to be able to fund debt maturities and interest payments with cash flows generated in our operations; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; or proceeds from additional external financing. see note 6 and item 7a for additional information on our debt.
comcast 2023 annual report on form 10-k we also have significant contractual obligations associated with our programming and production expenses. we have multiyear agreements for broadcast rights of sporting events, such as for the nfl, the olympics and the english premier league, which represent the substantial majority of our programming and production obligations. connectivity & platforms' programming expenses related to the distribution of third-party television networks are generally acquired under multiyear distribution agreements with fees based on the number of subscribers receiving the television network programming and a per subscriber fee. the amounts included in the table above relate to minimum guaranteed commitments for these distribution agreements or fixed fees, and as a result, we expect the total fees to be paid under these arrangements to be significantly higher than the amounts included above. we have funded and expect to continue to be able to fund our programming and production obligations with the cash generated from our operations. as of december 31, 2023, approximately 29% of cash payments related to our programming and production obligations are due after five years, of which the vast majority related to multiyear sports rights agreements. see note 4 for additional information on programming and production costs.
our other contractual obligations relate primarily to operating leases (see note 15) and other arrangements recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and/or disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, including benefit plan obligations (see note 11), liabilities for uncertain tax positions (see note 5), our remaining unfunded capital commitment to atairos (see note 8) and a contractual obligation related to an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks (see note 15).
guarantee structure our debt is primarily issued at comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. a substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. we believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
comcast 2023 annual report on form 10-k we believe our estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures below. see also notes 4 and 10.
valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights we assess the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including cable franchise rights, annually as of july 1, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. the assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. a quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. in connection with our impairment assessment process, in order to support our qualitative assessments, we typically perform quantitative assessments of our reporting units and cable franchise rights approximately once every four years.
goodwill goodwill results from business combinations and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable assets and liabilities recorded in the acquisition. we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level.
when performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values of our reporting units primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rates. when performing this analysis, we also consider multiples of earnings from comparable public companies and recent market transactions.
we assessed goodwill for impairment in connection with our change in segment presentation in the first quarter of 2023. see note 2 for additional information. based on our assessment, no impairment was required. we also performed a qualitative assessment for goodwill in each of our reporting units in connection with our annual impairment testing. this analysis considered the results of previous quantitative assessments, and also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair value of these reporting units in our qualitative assessments, including changes in projected future cash flows, recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions, discount rates, and changes in our market capitalization. based on these assessments, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially higher than their carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required.
in 2022, in connection with our annual impairment testing, we recorded an impairment of $8.1 billion related to goodwill in our sky reporting unit (see note 10). in preparing this assessment, we estimated the fair value of the sky reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis. this analysis involved significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business, including the estimated impact of macroeconomic conditions in the sky territories, as well as the selection of the discount rate, which increased by 125 basis points compared to the prior analysis. when analyzing the fair value indicated under the discounted cash flow model, we also considered multiples of earnings from comparable public companies and recent market transactions.
changes in market conditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an additional impairment charge.
cable franchise rights our cable franchise rights assets result from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services in a particular service area. the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights.
when performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates.
comcast 2023 annual report on form 10-k in 2023, we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights. at the time of our previous quantitative assessment in 2022, which was pursuant to our practice of performing quantitative assessments of cable franchise rights approximately once every four years, the estimated fair values of our franchise rights substantially exceeded their carrying values. we also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights in our qualitative assessment, including changes in our projected future cash flows, recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions, discount rates, and changes in our market capitalization. based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights were substantially higher than the carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required.
changes in market conditions, laws and regulations and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.
film and television content we capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. we have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis. amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue.
our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film's initial release. these estimates are based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film's theatrical performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. upon a film's release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.
with respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license window. initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue attributed to the initial license window. once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed beyond the initial license window, revenue estimates for these additional windows or platforms, such as u.s. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
we capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns. we recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. estimated relative value is generally based on terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract.
capitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. the substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. licensed content that is not part of a film group is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. when performing an impairment assessment, we estimate fair value primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows, which are supported by internal forecasts. impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.

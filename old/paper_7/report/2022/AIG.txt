throughout the md&a, we use certain terms and abbreviations, which are summarized in the glossary and acronyms.
we have incorporated into this discussion a number of cross-references to additional information included throughout this annual report to assist readers seeking additional information related to a particular subject.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | use of non-gaap measures use of non-gaap measures throughout this md&a, we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results. some of the measurements we use are "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules and regulations. gaap is the acronym for "generally accepted accounting principles" in the united states. the non-gaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies.
we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments. we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. when we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the consolidated results of operations section of this md&a.
book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (aoci) adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude re funds withheld assets and deferred tax assets (dta) (adjusted book value per common share) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-common share basis after eliminating items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of aig's available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and u.s. tax attribute deferred tax assets. this measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. in addition, we adjust for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude re funds withheld assets held by aig in support of fortitude re's reinsurance obligations to aig post deconsolidation of fortitude re (fortitude re funds withheld assets) since these fair value movements are economically transferred to fortitude re. we exclude deferred tax assets representing u.s. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the dta utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics. adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total aig common shareholders' equity, excluding aoci adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude re funds withheld assets, and dta (adjusted common shareholders' equity), by total common shares outstanding.
return on common equity - adjusted after-tax income excluding aoci adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude re funds withheld assets and dta (adjusted return on common equity) is used to show the rate of return on common shareholders' equity. we believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and u.s. tax attribute deferred tax assets. this measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. in addition, we adjust for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude re funds withheld assets since these fair value movements are economically transferred to fortitude re. we exclude deferred tax assets representing u.s. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the dta utilized is included in adjusted return on common equity. adjusted return on common equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to aig common shareholders by average adjusted common shareholders' equity.
adjusted after-tax income attributable to aig common shareholders is derived by excluding the tax effected adjusted pre-tax income (apti) adjustments described below, dividends on preferred stock, noncontrolling interest on net realized gains (losses), other non-operating expenses and the following tax items from net income attributable to aig:
•deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges;
•changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; and
•net tax charge related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act.
adjusted revenues exclude net realized gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in other income for gaap purposes), changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in net investment income for gaap purposes) and income from elimination of the international reporting lag. adjusted revenues is a gaap measure for our segments.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | use of non-gaap measures adjusted pre-tax income is derived by excluding the items set forth below from income from continuing operations before income tax. this definition is consistent across our segments. these items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. apti is a gaap measure for our segments. excluded items include the following:
•changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits;
•changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (dac), value of business acquired (voba), and deferred sales inducements (dsi) related to net realized gains and losses;
•changes in the fair value of equity securities;
•net investment income on fortitude re funds withheld assets;
•following deconsolidation of fortitude re, net realized gains and losses on fortitude re funds withheld assets;
•loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt;
•all net realized gains and losses except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement accruals) on derivative instruments used for non- qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication. earned income on such economic hedges is reclassified from net realized gains and losses to specific apti line items based on the economic risk being hedged (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances);
•income or loss from discontinued operations;
•net loss reserve discount benefit (charge);
•pension expense related to lump sum payments to former employees;
•net gain or loss on divestitures and other;
•non-operating litigation reserves and settlements;
•restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization;
•the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain;
•integration and transaction costs associated with acquiring or divesting businesses;
•losses from the impairment of goodwill;
•non-recurring costs associated with the implementation of non-ordinary course legal or regulatory changes or changes to accounting principles; and
•income from elimination of the international reporting lag.
•general insurance
-ratios: we, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. these ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for general insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under gaap, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. the underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. in addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.
-accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted (accident year loss ratio, ex-cat and accident year combined ratio, ex-cat): both the accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events, in each case, having a net impact on aig in excess of $10 million and man-made catastrophe losses, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. we believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management's control. we also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.
•life and retirement
-premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment-type annuity contracts, federal home loan bank (fhlb) funding agreements and mutual funds. we believe the measure of premiums and deposits is useful in understanding customer demand for our products, evolving product trends and our sales performance period over period.
results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.
the accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:
•loss reserves;•future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts;•guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity, fixed annuity and fixed index annuity products;•valuation of embedded derivative liabilities for fixed index annuity and life products;•estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs and unearned revenue for investment-oriented products;•reinsurance assets, including the allowance for credit losses and disputes;•goodwill impairment;•allowance for credit losses on certain investments, primarily on loans and available for sale fixed maturity securities;•fair value measurements of certain financial assets and financial liabilities; and•income taxes, in particular the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and establishment of provisions for uncertain tax positions.
these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.
loss reserves loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of unpaid claims, including estimates for claims incurred but not reported and loss adjustment expenses, less applicable discount. we regularly review and update the methods used to determine loss reserve estimates. because these estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are common given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed.
the estimate of loss reserves relies on several key judgments:
•the determination of the actuarial methods used as the basis for these estimates;
•the relative weights given to these models by product line;
•the underlying assumptions used in these models; and
•the determination of the appropriate groupings of similar product lines and, in some cases, the disaggregation of dissimilar losses within a product line.
numerous assumptions are made in determining the best estimate of reserves for each line of business, in consideration of expected ultimate losses, loss cost trends and loss development factors, where appropriate. the importance of any one assumption can vary by both line of business and accident year. because such assumptions may differ from actual experience, there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves. this estimation uncertainty is particularly relevant for long-tail lines of business.
all of our methods to calculate net reserves include assumptions about estimated reinsurance recoveries and their collectability. reinsurance collectability is evaluated independently of the reserving process and appropriate allowances for uncollectible reinsurance are established.
overview of loss reserving process and methods our loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups: short-tail reserves and long-tail reserves. short-tail reserves consist principally of u.s. property and special risks, europe property and special risks, u.s. personal insurance, and europe and japan personal insurance. long-tail reserves include u.s. workers' compensation, u.s. excess casualty, u.s. other casualty, u.s. financial lines, and uk/europe casualty and financial lines.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates short-tail reserves in short-tail lines of business, such as property or personal insurance, where the nature of these claims tends to be higher frequency with short reporting periods, with volatility arising from occasional severe events, the actual losses reported make up a greater proportion of the ultimate loss estimate. during the first few development quarters of an accident year, the expected ultimate losses generally reflect the average loss costs from a period of preceding accident quarters that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost trends, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular line of business. for more mature quarters, specific loss development methods and/or frequency/severity methods may be used to determine the incurred but not reported (ibnr). ibnr for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined in close collaboration with the claims department's knowledge of known information, using alternative techniques or expected percentages of ultimate loss emergence based on historical emergence of similar events or claim types.
long-tail reserves estimation of loss reserves for our long-tail business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the product line and volume of business, as well as estimates of reinsurance recoveries. experience in more recent accident years generally provides limited statistical credibility of reported net losses on long-tail business. that is because in the more recent accident years, a relatively low proportion of estimated ultimate net incurred losses are reported or paid. therefore, ibnr reserves constitute a relatively high proportion of loss reserves.
for our long-tail lines, we generally make actuarial and other assumptions with respect to the following:
•loss cost trend factors, which are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratios for prior accident years.
•expected loss ratios, which are used for the latest accident year and, in some cases, for accident years prior to the latest accident year. the expected loss ratio also generally reflects the average loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss cost trend and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors on the loss ratio.
•loss development factors, which are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. generally, the actual loss development factors observed from prior accident years would be used as a basis to determine the loss development factors for the subsequent accident years.
•tail factors, which are development factors used for certain long-tail lines of business to project future loss development for periods that extend beyond the available development data. the development of losses to the ultimate loss for a given accident year for these lines may take decades and the projection of ultimate losses for an accident year is very sensitive to the tail factors selected beyond a certain age.
we record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each product line of business. the overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all product lines of business. the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each subset of coverage less any amounts paid. also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest detailed valuation reviews, large loss analyses, or other analytical techniques, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve and incurred losses for the current quarter. differences between actual loss emergence in a given period and our expectations based on prior loss reserve estimates are used to monitor reserve adequacy between detailed valuation reviews and may also influence our judgment with respect to adjusting reserve estimates.
details of the loss reserving process the process of determining the current loss ratio for each product line of business is based on a variety of factors. these include considerations such as: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; and changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business. other considerations include actual and anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration or in the legal and claims environment. the current loss ratio for each product line of business is intended to represent our best estimate after reflecting all relevant factors. at the close of each quarter, the assumptions and data underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine whether they remain appropriate. this process includes a review of the actual loss experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in reinsurance, quantifiable changes in coverage or mix of business, and changes in other factors that may affect the loss ratio. the loss ratio is changed to reflect the revised estimate if this review suggests that the previously determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate and, generally, shorter tailed lines of business are more likely to experience changes than longer tailed lines for immature accident years unless the information is directionally unfavorable.
we conduct a comprehensive loss reserve detailed valuation review at least annually for each product line of business in accordance with actuarial standards of practice. these standards provide that the unpaid loss estimate may be presented in a variety of ways, such as a point estimate, a range of estimates, a point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimates, or a probability distribution of the unpaid loss amount. our actuarial best estimate for each product line of business represents an expected value generally considering a range of reasonably possible outcomes.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates the reserve analysis, globally, for each product line of business is performed by a credentialed actuarial team in collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management. our actuaries consider the ongoing applicability of prior data groupings and update numerous assumptions, including the analysis and selection of loss development and loss trend factors. they also determine and select the appropriate actuarial or other methods used to develop our best estimate for each business product line, and may employ multiple methods and assumptions for each product line. these data groupings, accident year weights, method selections and assumptions necessarily change over time as business mix changes, development factors mature and become more credible and loss characteristics evolve. we consult with third-party specialists to help inform our judgments as needed. through the execution of these detailed valuation reviews an actuarial best estimate of the loss reserve is determined. the sum of these estimates for each product line of business yields an overall actuarial best estimate for that line of business.
a critical component of our detailed valuation reviews is an internal peer review of our reserving analyses and conclusions, where actuaries independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions used, methods selected, and weightings given to different methods. in addition, each detailed valuation review is subjected to a review and challenge process by specialists in our enterprise risk management (erm) group.
for certain product lines, we measure sensitivities and determine explicit ranges around the actuarial best estimate using multiple methodologies and varying assumptions. where we have ranges, we use them to inform our selection of best estimates of loss reserves by product line of business. our range of reasonable estimates is not intended to cover all possibilities or extreme values and is based on known data and facts at the time of estimation.
actuarial and other methods for our lines of business our actuaries determine the appropriate actuarial methods and segmentation. this determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the losses associated with the product line of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. in addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. this determination is a judgmental, dynamic process and refinements to the groupings are made every year. the groupings may change to reflect observed or emerging patterns within and across product lines, or to differentiate risk characteristics (for example, size of deductibles and extent of third-party claims specialists used by our insureds). as an example of reserve segmentation, we write many unique subsets of professional liability insurance, which cover different products, industry segments, and coverage structures. while for pricing or other purposes, it may be appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subset individually, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subsets into larger groups for reserving purposes to produce a greater degree of credibility in the loss experience. this determination of data segmentation and related actuarial methods is assessed, reviewed and updated at least annually.
the actuarial methods we use most commonly include paid and incurred loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including "bornhuetter ferguson" and "cape cod," and frequency/severity models. loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years updated through the current year to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for all accident years. we also use this information to update our current accident year loss selections. loss development methods are generally most appropriate for lines of business that exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the product line have similar development characteristics. expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the product line of business to determine the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses. we generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacked sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new product lines of business or for long-tail product lines at early stages of loss development. frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.
a key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond more quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the product line of business. therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to a prior expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. on the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is anomalous due to the various key factors described above and the inherent volatility in some of the lines. for example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it is a fundamental shift in the development pattern. in these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as bornhuetter ferguson have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates the cape cod method is a hybrid between the loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods, where the historic loss data and loss development factor assumptions are used to determine the expected loss ratio estimate in the bornhuetter ferguson method.
where appropriate, supplemental analysis for the given line of business may be performed in addition to the above described techniques such as shareholder class action (sca) suit analysis for d&o coverages.
frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. in certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. however, for average severity to be predictable, the product line of business must consist of homogenous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent and where there are limited changes to deductible levels or limits. generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity product lines of business such as personal auto. however, frequency and severity metrics are also used to test the reasonability of results for other product lines of business and provide indications of underlying trends in the data. in addition, ultimate claim counts can be used as an alternative exposure measure to earned premiums in the cape cod method.
the estimation of liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental pollution losses on insurance policies written many years ago is typically subject to greater uncertainty than other types of losses. this is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. in addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. for these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. the insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.
we continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental losses emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. the current environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis. nevertheless, most of these legacy exposures have been heavily reinsured with very highly rated reinsurers.
the majority of our remaining exposures for asbestos and environmental losses are related to excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts, with litigation expenses included within the limits of the liability we incur. individual significant loss reserves, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case-by-case basis.

u.s. excess casualty                         we utilize various loss cost trend assumptions for different segments of the portfolio. in our judgment, after evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, it is reasonably possible that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2022 detailed valuation review for u.s. excess casualty may range 5 percentage points lower or higher than this estimated loss trend. the loss cost trend assumption is critical for the u.s. excess casualty line of business due to the long-tail nature of the losses, and it is applied across many accident years. thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years (the expected loss ratio years) to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends that were initially relied upon in setting the loss reserves. these changes in loss trends could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.u.s. excess casualty is a long-tail line of business and any deviation in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. mass tort claims in particular may develop over a very extended period and impact multiple accident years, so we usually select a separate pattern for them. thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves. in our judgment, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, it is reasonably possible that the actual loss development factors could vary by an amount equivalent to a six month shift from those actually utilized in the year-end 2022 detailed valuation review. this would impact projections both for accident years where the selections were directly based on loss development methods as well as the a priori loss ratio assumptions for accident years with selections based on bornhuetter ferguson or cape cod methods. similar to loss cost trends, these changes in loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.given the very long-tail nature of this business, the tail factor selection can also have material impact on our carried reserves. the sensitivity around tail selection may also be a proxy for the sensitivity of a calendar year impact of monetary inflation on unpaid losses. it is reasonably possible for the tail factors for excess casualty could vary by 2 percentage points below to 3.5 percentage points above those indicated in the 2022 detailed valuation review.
u.s. other casualty                          the key assumptions for other casualty lines are similar to u.s. excess casualty, as the underlying business is long-tailed and can be subject to variability in loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. these may differ significantly by line of business as coverages such as general liability, medical malpractice and environmental may be subject to different risk drivers.
u.s. financial lines                         the loss cost trends for u.s. directors and officers (d&amp;o) liability business vary by year and subset. after evaluating the historical loss cost levels from prior accident years since the early 1990s, including the potential effect of losses relating to the credit crisis, in our judgment, it is reasonably possible that the actual variation in loss cost levels for these subsets could vary by approximately 10 percentage points lower or higher on a year-over-year basis than the assumptions actually utilized in the year-end 2022 reserve review. because the u.s. d&amp;o business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation. in our analysis, the effects of loss cost trend assumptions affect the results through the a priori loss ratio assumptions used for the bornhuetter ferguson and cape cod methods, which impact the projections for the more recent accident years.the selected loss development factors are also an important assumption, but are less critical than for u.s. excess casualty. because these lines are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for u.s. excess casualty. however, the high severity nature of the losses does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. similar to u.s. excess casualty, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably possible that actual loss development factors could change by an amount equivalent to a shift by six months from those actually utilized in the year-end 2022 reserve review.
uk/europe casualty andfinancial lines        similar to u.s. business, uk/europe casualty and financial lines can be significantly impacted by loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. the variation in such factors can differ significantly by product and region, however the range of potential impacts is much lower than that of other lines of business noted above.

future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts long-duration traditional products primarily include whole life insurance, term life insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities including pension risk transfer (prt) business and structured settlements. in addition, these products also include accident and health, and long-term care (ltc) insurance. the ltc block is in run-off and has been fully reinsured with fortitude re.
for long-duration traditional business, a "lock-in" principle applies. generally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future benefits less the present value of future net premiums (portion of the gross premium required to provide for all benefits and expenses). the assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and dac are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. the assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. these assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs. the assumptions also include margins for adverse deviation, principally for key assumptions such as mortality and interest rates used to discount cash flows, to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. establishing margins at contract inception requires management judgment. the extent of the margin for adverse deviation may vary depending on the uncertainty of the cash flows, which is affected by the volatility of the business and the extent of our experience with the product.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. to determine whether loss recognition exists, we determine whether a future loss is expected based on updated current best estimate assumptions. if loss recognition exists, the assumptions as of the loss recognition test date are locked-in and used in subsequent valuations and the net reserves continue to be subject to loss recognition testing. because of the long-term nature of many of our liabilities subject to the "lock-in" principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve balances. in particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve balances.
groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of the business and are applied by product groupings, that span across issuance years, including traditional life, payout annuities and ltc insurance. once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle. our policy is to perform loss recognition testing net of reinsurance. the business ceded to fortitude re, is grouped separately. since 100 percent of the risk has been ceded, no additional loss recognition events are expected to occur unless this business is recaptured.
key judgments made in loss recognition testing include the following:
•to determine investment returns used in loss recognition tests, we project future cash flows on the assets supporting the liabilities. the duration of these assets is generally comparable to the duration of the liabilities and such assets are primarily comprised of diversified portfolio of high to medium quality fixed maturity securities, and may also include, to a lesser extent, alternative investments. our projections include a reasonable allowance for investment expenses and expected credit losses over the projection horizon. a critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flows are to be reinvested.
•for mortality assumptions, base future assumptions take into account industry and our historical experience, as well as expected mortality changes in the future. the latter judgment is based on a combination of historical mortality trends and industry observations, public health and demography specialists that were consulted by aig's actuaries and published industry information.
•for surrender rates, key judgments involve the correlation between expected increases/decreases in interest rates and increases/decreases in surrender rates. to support this judgment, we compare crediting rates on our products to expected rates on competing products under different interest rate scenarios.
•significant unrealized appreciation on investments in a low interest rate environment may cause dac to be adjusted and additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded through a charge directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (changes related to unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments). these charges are included, net of tax, with the change in net unrealized appreciation of investments. in applying changes related to unrealized appreciation of investments, the company overlays unrealized gains and other changes related to unrealized appreciation of investments onto loss recognition tests.
for additional information on impact of changes related to unrealized appreciation (depreciation) to investments, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
for universal life policies with secondary guarantees, we recognize certain liabilities in addition to policyholder account balances. for universal life policies with secondary guarantees, as well as other universal life policies for which profits followed by losses are expected at contract inception, a liability is recognized based on a benefit ratio of (i) the present value of total expected payments, in excess of the account value, over the life of the contract, divided by (ii) the present value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract. universal life account balances are reported in policyholder contract deposits, while these additional liabilities related to universal life products are reported within future policy benefits in the consolidated balance sheets. these additional liabilities are also adjusted to reflect the effect of unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturity securities available for sale on accumulated assessments, with related changes recognized through other comprehensive income (loss). the primary policyholder behavior assumptions for these liabilities include mortality, lapses and premium persistency. the primary capital market assumptions used for the liability for universal life secondary guarantees include discount rates and net earned rates.

aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity, fixed annuity and fixed index annuity products variable annuity products offered by our individual retirement and group retirement segments offer guaranteed benefit features. these guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (gmdb) that are payable in the event of death and living benefits that guarantee lifetime withdrawals regardless of fixed account and separate account value performance. living benefit features primarily include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (gmwb).
for additional information on these features, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
the liability for gmdb, which is recorded in future policy benefits, represents the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with the excess recognized ratably through policyholder benefits over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. the liabilities for variable annuity gmwb, which are recorded in policyholder contract deposits, are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in net realized gains (losses).
certain of our fixed annuity and fixed index annuity contracts, which are not offered through separate accounts, contain optional gmwb benefits. different versions of these gmwb riders contain different guarantee provisions. the liability for gmwb benefits in fixed annuity and fixed index annuity contracts for which the rider guarantee is considered to be clearly and closely related to the host contract are recorded in future policy benefits. this gmwb liability represents the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with the excess recognized ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments, through policyholder benefits. for rider guarantees in certain fixed index annuity contracts that are linked to equity indices that are considered to be embedded derivatives that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, the gmwb liability is recorded in policyholder contract deposits and measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in net realized gains (losses).
our exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder's account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. a deferred annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a gmdb and a gmwb. however, a policyholder can generally only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e., the features are generally mutually exclusive (except a surviving spouse who has a rider to potentially collect both a gmdb upon their spouse's death and a gmwb during his or her lifetime). a policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a low interest rate environment increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits.

estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs and unearned revenue for investment-oriented products policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts related to universal life insurance and investment-type products, for example, variable, fixed and fixed index annuities (collectively, investment-oriented products) are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the expected lives of the contracts, except in instances where significant negative gross profits are expected in one or more periods. investment oriented products have a long duration and a disclosed crediting interest rate. total gross profits include both actual gross profits and estimates of gross profits for future periods. estimated gross profits include current and projected interest rates, net investment income and spreads, net realized gains and losses, fees, surrender rates, mortality experience and equity market returns and volatility. in estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on dac amortization. for fixed index annuity contracts, the future spread between investment income and interest credited to policyholders is a significant judgment, particularly in a low interest rate environment. we regularly evaluate our assumptions used for estimated gross profits. if the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change, dac and related reserves, including voba, dsi, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserve (urr), are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.
in estimating future gross profits for variable annuity products as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, a long-term annual asset growth assumption of 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) was applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees. in determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a reversion to the mean methodology, whereby short-term asset growth above or below the long-term annual rate assumption impacts the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. the reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance. when actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long-term growth assumption, as evidenced by growth assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period falling below a certain rate (floor) or above a certain rate (cap) for a sustained period, judgment may be applied to revise or "unlock" the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five-year reversion to the mean period as well as the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods.

(c)represents the net impact of one percent parallel shift in the yield curve on the value of the gmwb embedded derivative. does not represent interest rate spread compression on investment-oriented products.
the sensitivity ranges of 10 basis points, one percent and 10 percent are included for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect the changes in net investment spreads, equity return, volatility, interest rate, mortality or lapse used by aig in its fair value analyses or estimates of future gross profits to value dac and related reserves. changes different from those illustrated may occur in any period and by different products.
the analysis of dac, embedded derivatives and other reserves related to guaranteed benefits, and unearned revenue reserve is a dynamic process that considers all relevant factors and assumptions described above. we estimate each of the above factors individually, without the effect of any correlation among the key assumptions. an assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results. the effects on pre-tax income in the sensitivity analysis table above do not reflect the related effects from our economic hedging program, which utilizes derivative and other financial instruments and is designed so that changes in value of those instruments move in the opposite direction of changes in the guaranteed benefit embedded derivative liabilities.

aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates reinsurance assets in the ordinary course of business, our insurance companies may use both treaty and facultative reinsurance to minimize their net loss exposure to any single catastrophic loss event or to an accumulation of losses from a number of smaller events or to provide greater diversification of our businesses. reinsurance assets include the balances due from reinsurance and insurance companies under the terms of our reinsurance agreements for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and benefits paid and unpaid. the estimation of reinsurance recoverables involves a significant amount of judgment. reinsurance assets include reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that are estimated as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, are subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves. for additional information on reinsurance, see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. a qualitative assessment may be performed, considering whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an operating segment is less than its carrying value. if management elects to perform a quantitative assessment to determine recoverability of carrying value or is compelled to do so based on the results of a qualitative assessment, the estimate of fair value involves applying one or a combination of common valuation approaches. these include discounted expected future cash flows, market-based earnings multiples and external appraisals, among other methods, all of which require management judgment and are subject to uncertainty, primarily as it relates to assumptions around business growth, earnings projections, and cost of capital.
for additional information on goodwill impairment, see part i, item 1a. risk factors - estimates and assumptions and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
allowance for credit losses on certain investments we maintain an allowance for the expected lifetime credit losses of commercial and residential mortgage loans and available for sale securities. the sufficiency of this allowance is reviewed quarterly using both quantitative and qualitative considerations, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. these considerations and the overall methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses are discussed in more detail in note 5 and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for available for sale securities and commercial and residential loans, respectively.
fair value measurements of certain financial assets and financial liabilities assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are measured and classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three levels based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. we classify fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation. we consider unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available. our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an asset or liability requires judgment.
for additional information about the valuation methodologies of financial instruments measured at fair value, see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates income taxes deferred income taxes represent the tax effect of the differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. our assessment of net deferred income taxes represents management's best estimate of the tax consequences of various events and transactions, which can themselves be based on other accounting estimates, resulting in incremental uncertainty in the estimation process.
deferred tax asset recoverability the evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. as such, changes in tax laws in countries where we transact business can impact our deferred tax asset valuation allowance. we consider multiple factors to reliably estimate future taxable income so we can determine the extent of our ability to realize net operating losses, foreign tax credits, realized capital loss and other carryforwards. these factors include forecasts of future income for each of our businesses, which incorporate forecasts of future statutory income for our insurance companies, and actual and planned business and operational changes, both of which include assumptions about future macroeconomic and aig-specific conditions and events. we subject the forecasts to stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization. we also apply stresses to our assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in performing our assessment of recoverability, we consider tax laws governing the utilization of net operating loss, capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards in each applicable jurisdiction. these tax laws are subject to change, resulting in incremental uncertainty in our assessment of recoverability.
uncertain tax positions uncertain tax positions represent aig's liability for income taxes on tax years subject to review by the internal revenue service (irs) or other tax authorities. we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, based on technical merits, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recognized in the financial statements. a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. the completion of review, or the expiration of federal statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the liability for income taxes.
for a discussion of our framework for assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and other tax topics, see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.

separation of life and retirement business on september 19, 2022, aig closed on the initial public offering (ipo) of 80 million shares of corebridge financial, inc. (corebridge) common stock at a public offering price of $21.00 per share, representing 12.4 percent of corebridge's common stock. corebridge is the holding company for aig's life and retirement business. the aggregate gross proceeds of the offering to aig, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses payable by aig, were approximately $1.7 billion. after consideration of underwriting discounts, commissions and other related expenses payable by aig, aig recorded $608 million as an increase in aig's shareholder's equity.
relationship with blackstone inc.
in november 2021, aig and blackstone inc. (blackstone) completed the acquisition by blackstone of a 9.9 percent equity stake in corebridge.
in 2021, aig entered into a long-term asset management relationship with blackstone, pursuant to which blackstone is initially managing $50 billion of corebridge's existing investment portfolio, with that amount increasing to an aggregate of $92.5 billion over the next five years.
on december 15, 2021, aig and blackstone real estate income trust (breit), a long-term, perpetual capital vehicle affiliated with blackstone, completed the acquisition by breit of aig's interests in a u.s. affordable housing portfolio. the historical results of the u.s. affordable housing portfolio were reported in our life and retirement operating segments.
our investment management agreements with blackrock since april 2022, aig and corebridge insurance company subsidiaries have entered into separate investment management agreements with blackrock. certain additional insurance company subsidiaries will also enter into such investment management agreements over the coming months. we have since transferred the management of approximately $162 billion of our investments in liquid fixed income and certain private placement assets, including $98 billion of the corebridge investment portfolio, to blackrock under such investment management agreements as of december 31, 2022. the investment management agreements contain detailed investment guidelines and reporting requirements. these agreements also contain reasonable and customary representations and warranties, standard of care, expense reimbursement, liability, indemnity and other provisions. the investment management agreements continue unless terminated by either party on 45 days' notice or by us immediately for cause. we continue to be responsible for our overall investment portfolio, including decisions surrounding asset allocation, risk composition and investment strategy.
sale of certain aig life and retirement retail mutual funds business on july 16, 2021, aig announced the closing of the sale of certain assets of life and retirement's retail mutual funds business to touchstone investments (touchstone), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of western & southern financial group. upon closing, the twelve retail mutual funds managed by sunamerica asset management, llc (saamco), with $6.8 billion in assets, were reorganized into touchstone funds.
sale of fortitude holdings on june 2, 2020, we completed the sale of a majority of the interests in fortitude group holdings, llc (fortitude holdings) to carlyle frl, l.p. (carlyle frl), an investment fund advised by an affiliate of the carlyle group inc. (carlyle), and t&d united capital co., ltd. (t&d), a subsidiary of t&d holdings, inc., under the terms of a membership interest purchase agreement entered into on november 25, 2019 by and among aig, fortitude holdings, carlyle frl, carlyle, t&d and t&d holdings, inc. (the majority interest fortitude sale). as a result of completion of the majority interest fortitude sale, aig received $2.2 billion of proceeds and recorded a total after-tax reduction to total aig shareholders' equity of $4.3 billion related to the sale of the majority interest in and deconsolidation of fortitude holdings in the second quarter of 2020.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | executive summary aig's outlook - industry and economic factors our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. we continued to operate under challenging market conditions in 2022, characterized by factors such as the impact of covid-19 and the related governmental and societal responses, rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, an uneven global economic recovery and global trade tensions. responses by central banks and monetary authorities with respect to inflation, growth concerns and other macroeconomic factors have also affected global exchange rates and volatility.
russia/ukraine conflict the russia/ukraine conflict began in february 2022. the conflict has and may continue to have a significant impact on the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, including increased volatility in capital and commodity markets, rapid changes to regulatory conditions around the globe including the use of sanctions, operational challenges for multinational corporations, inflationary pressures and an increased risk of cybersecurity incidents.
the conflict is evolving and has the potential to adversely affect our business and results of operations from an investment, underwriting and operational perspective. while we believe we have taken appropriate actions to minimize related risk, we continue to monitor potential exposure and operational impacts, as well as any actual and potential claims activity. the ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including scope, severity and duration, the governmental, legislative and regulatory actions taken (including the application of sanctions), and court decisions, if any, rendered in response to those actions.
impact of changes in the interest rate environment and equity markets key u.s. benchmark rates continued to rise during 2022 as markets reacted to heightened inflation measures, geopolitical risk, and the board of governors of the federal reserve system implementing multiple increases to short term interest rates. as of december 31, 2022, due to increases in benchmark rates, combined with general widening of credit spreads, the yield on new investments has generally exceeded the yield on asset maturities and redemptions. the yield pick-up of new investments over the yields on asset maturities and redemptions averaged 70 basis points during 2022. this combined with resetting of coupon rates on floating rate securities and loans has steadily improved the overall portfolio yields. however, the key benchmark rates remain highly volatile. we actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset-liability management, including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities, but we may not be able to fully mitigate our interest rate risk by matching exposure of our assets relative to our liabilities.
equity markets our financial results are impacted by the performance of equity markets, which impacts the performance of our alternative investment portfolio, fee income, net amount at risk, policyholder benefits and dac. for instance, in our variable annuity separate accounts, mutual fund assets and brokerage and advisory assets, we generally earn fee income based on the account value, which fluctuates with the equity markets as a significant amount of these assets are invested in equity funds. the impact of equity market returns, both increases and decreases, is reflected in our results due to the impact on the account value and the fair values of equity-exposed securities in our life and retirement investment portfolio.
in life and retirement, hedging costs could also be significantly impacted by changes in the level of equity markets as rebalancing and option costs are tied to the equity market volatility, and we may be required to post additional collateral when equity markets are higher. these hedging costs are mostly offset by our rider fees that are tied to the level of the chicago board options exchange volatility index. as rebalancing and option costs increase or decrease, the rider fees will increase or decrease partially offsetting the hedging costs incurred.
alternative investments include private equity funds which are generally reported on a one-quarter lag. accordingly, changes in valuations driven by equity market conditions during the fourth quarter of 2022 may impact the private equity investments in the alternative investments portfolio in the first quarter of 2023.
annuity sales and surrenders the rising rate environment and our partnership with blackstone have provided a strong tailwind for fixed annuity sales with sales in the three to five‐year products significantly increasing. continued rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but also drives higher surrenders. fixed annuities have surrender charge periods, generally in the three-to-seven year range. fixed index annuities have surrender charge periods, generally in the five-to-ten year range, and within our group retirement segment, certain of our fixed investment options are subject to other withdrawal restrictions, which may help mitigate increased early surrenders in a rising rate environment. in addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in fixed annuities, although the reserves for such contracts have aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | executive summary continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. we closely monitor surrenders of fixed annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period.
reinvestment and spread management we actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. we also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. business strategies continue to evolve and we attempt to maintain profitability of the overall business in light of the interest rate environment. a rising interest rate environment results in improved yields on new investments and improves margins for our life and retirement business while also making certain products, such as fixed annuities, more attractive to potential customers. however, the rising rate environment has resulted in lower values on general and separate accounts assets, mutual fund assets and brokerage and advisory assets that hold investments in fixed income assets.
for additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies, see investments.
for investment-oriented products, including universal life insurance, and variable, fixed and fixed index annuities, in our individual retirement, group retirement, life insurance and institutional markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. we expect to continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business, as appropriate, to be responsive to a rising rate environment. as interest rates rise, we may need to raise crediting rates on in-force business for competitive and other reasons, potentially offsetting a portion of the additional investment income resulting from investing in a higher interest rate environment.
of the aggregate fixed account values of our individual retirement and group retirement annuity products, 64 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate as of december 31, 2022. the percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent were 55 percent and 58 percent as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. in the universal life products in our life insurance business, 62 percent and 67 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. these businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to manage the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales in the context of regulatory requirements and competitive positioning.

general insurance our net investment income is significantly impacted by market interest rates as well as the deployment of asset allocation strategies to manage duration, enhance yield and manage interest rate risk. as interest rates increase, so too does our ability to reinvest future cash inflows from premiums, as well as sales and maturities of existing investments, at more favorable rates. for additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies, see investments.
while the impact of rising interest rates on our general insurance segment increases the benefit of investment income, the current and medium-term inflationary environment may also translate into higher loss cost trends. we monitor these trends closely, particularly loss cost trend uncertainty, to ensure that not only our pricing, but also our loss reserving assumptions are proactive to, and considerate of, current and future economic conditions.
for our general insurance segment loss reserves, rising interest rates may favorably impact the statutory net loss reserve discount for workers' compensation and its associated amortization.
impact of currency volatility currency volatility remains acute. strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro, british pound and the japanese yen (the major currencies) impacts income for our businesses with substantial international operations. in particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in u.s. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. the net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.
these currencies may continue to fluctuate, especially as a result of central bank responses to inflation, concerns regarding future economic growth and other macroeconomic factors, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in u.s. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability.
general insurance businesses are transacted in most major foreign currencies. the following table presents the average of the quarterly weighted average exchange rates of the major currencies, which have the most significant impact on our businesses:

net income (loss) attributable to aig common shareholders comparison for 2022 and 2021
net income attributable to aig common shareholders increased $888 million due to the following, on a pre-tax basis:
•an increase in net realized gains on fortitude re funds withheld embedded derivative of $8.1 billion driven by interest rate movements, partially offset by losses on fortitude re funds withheld assets of $486 million in 2022 compared to a gain of $1.0 billion in 2021;
•higher underwriting income in general insurance of $1.1 billion, including $86 million attributable to eliminating the international reporting lag, reflecting the continued earn-in of positive rate change, strong renewal retentions and new business production, as well as increased favorable prior year development and lower catastrophe losses. underwriting income was negatively impacted by unfavorable movements in foreign exchange. for additional information on the elimination of the international reporting lag, see note 1 to the to the consolidated financial statements.
•lower interest expense of $180 million primarily driven by interest savings of $225 million from $9.4 billion debt repurchases, through cash tender offers and debt redemptions in 2022 as well as $92 million from $3.6 billion of debt repurchases, through cash tender offers and debt redemptions in 2021, as well as interest savings of $100 million on debt borrowing due to the sale of affordable housing in 2021. these decreases are partially offset by interest expense of $240 million on $6.5 billion corebridge senior unsecured notes, $1.5 billion draw down on corebridge ddtl facility and $1.0 billion junior subordinated debt issued by corebridge in 2022.
the increase in net income attributable to aig common shareholders was partially offset by the following, on a pre-tax basis:
•lower net gains on divestitures and other due to loss of $82 million in 2022 compared with net gains on divestitures and other in 2021 due to the recognition of $3.0 billion gain from the sale of the affordable housing portfolio and $102 million gain from the sale of certain assets of the retail mutual funds business in 2021.
•lower net investment income of $2.8 billion primarily driven by lower returns on our alternative investments of $1.9 billion and declines in fair value of fixed maturity securities where we elected the fair value option of $810 million as a result of the higher rate environment and negative equity market performance.
•higher income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $464 million driven by the sale of 9.9 percent interest of corebridge to blackstone in december 2021 and the 12.4 percent ipo of corebridge in september 2022.
•a decrease in net realized gains excluding fortitude re funds withheld assets and embedded derivative of $245 million, driven by a $2.9 billion increase in derivative and hedge activity and gains on variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of hedging, partially offset by losses on sales of securities of $1.1 billion and sales of alternative investments and real estate of $795 million, unfavorable movement in the allowance for credit losses on fixed maturity securities and loans of $421 million and absence of realized gains related to affordable housing portfolio sale in 2021 of $219 million.
the $830 million increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to higher income from continuing operations.
income tax expense analysis for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, the effective tax rate on income (loss) from continuing operations was 21.0 percent and 18.0 percent, respectively.

competition and challenges general insurance operates in a highly competitive industry against global, national and local insurers and reinsurers and underwriting syndicates in specific market areas and product types. insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service levels and terms and conditions. we serve our business and individual customers on a global basis - from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. general insurance seeks to differentiate itself in the markets where we participate by providing leading expertise and insight to clients, distribution partners and other stakeholders, delivering underwriting excellence and value-driven insurance solutions and providing high quality, tailored end-to-end support to stakeholders. in doing so, we leverage our world-class global franchise, multinational capabilities, balance sheet strength and financial flexibility.
our challenges include:
•ensuring adequate business pricing given passage of time to reporting and settlement for insurance business, particularly with respect to long-tail commercial lines exposures;
•impact of social and economic inflation on claim frequency and severity; and
•volatility in claims arising from natural and man-made catastrophes and other aggregations of risk exposure.
outlook - industry and economic factors below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our operating segments:
the results of general insurance for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022 reflect continued strong performance from our commercial lines portfolio and focused execution on our portfolio management strategies within personal insurance. across our north america and international commercial lines of business we have seen increased demand for our insurance products with continued positive rate change and improvement in terms and conditions. we continue to monitor inflationary impacts resulting from government stimulus in recent years, ongoing labor force and supply chain disruptions and rising commodity prices, among other factors, on rate adequacy and loss cost trends. similarly, we are monitoring the responsive monetary policy actions taken or anticipated to be taken by central banks, to curb inflation and the corresponding impact on market interest rates.
general insurance - north america north america commercial remains in a firm market amidst a backdrop of increasing claims severity due to elevated economic and social inflation, as well as a higher frequency and severity of natural catastrophe losses over recent years (which we believe to be in part connected to climate change). while market discipline continues to support price increases across most lines, we are seeing capacity move back into the market in certain segments given the improved pricing levels which is putting pressure on rates. we have focused on retaining our best accounts which has led to improving retention across the portfolio. these retention rates are often coupled with an exposure limit management strategy to reduce volatility within the portfolio. we continue to proactively identify segment growth areas as market conditions warrant through effective portfolio management, while non-renewing unprofitable business.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | general insurance personal insurance growth prospects are supported by the need for full life cycle products and coverage, increases in personal wealth accumulation, and awareness of insurance protection and risk management. we compete in the high net worth market, accident and health insurance, travel insurance, and warranty services and will continue to expand our innovative products and services to distribution partners and clients.
general insurance - international we are continuing to pursue growth in our most profitable lines of business and diversify our portfolio across all regions by expanding key business lines while remaining a market leader in key developed and developing markets. overall, commercial lines continue to show positive rate change, particularly in our financial lines, property, energy and marine portfolios and across international markets where market events or withdrawal of capability and capacity have favorably impacted pricing. we are maintaining our underwriting discipline, reducing gross and net limits where appropriate, utilizing reinsurance to reduce volatility, as well as continuing our risk selection strategy to improve profitability.
personal insurance focuses on individual customers, as well as group and corporate clients. although market competition within personal insurance has increased, we continue to benefit from the underwriting quality and portfolio diversity.

business and financial highlights net premiums written comparison for 2022 and 2021
net premiums written increased by $631 million primarily due to growth in commercial lines ($673 million), particularly in property, casualty and aig re, driven by continued positive rate change, higher renewal retentions and strong new business production, as well as growth in crop risk services driven by higher commodity prices, partially offset by a decrease in financial lines due to volatility in capital markets and uncertain economic conditions.
this increase was partially offset by lower production in personal insurance ($42 million), particularly in warranty as well as underwriting actions taken in pcg to improve profitability, partially offset by an increase in travel.
underwriting income (loss) comparison for 2022 and 2021
underwriting income of $648 million in 2022 compared to an underwriting loss of $47 million in 2021 primarily reflected:
•premium growth with improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted (4.1 points) primarily driven by changes in business mix along with continued positive rate change, focused risk selection and improved terms and conditions; and
•lower catastrophe losses (3.0 points or $253 million).
this improvement was partially offset by:
•higher expense ratio of 1.1 points reflecting a higher acquisition ratio (1.3 points) primarily driven by changes in business mix and reinsurance, partially offset by a lower general operating expense ratio (0.2 points) resulting from continued general expense discipline as we grow the portfolio; and
•lower net favorable prior year reserve development in 2022 compared 2021 (0.2 points or $34 million), primarily due to lower favorable development in pcg and higher unfavorable development within financial lines, partially offset by higher favorable development in property, casualty and crop risk services.

business and financial highlights net premiums written comparison for 2022 and 2021
net premiums written, excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange ($1,287 million), increased by $278 million due to growth in commercial lines ($417 million), notably specialty, property and casualty driven by continued positive rate change and strong new business production.
this increase was partially offset by lower production in personal insurance ($139 million), where declines in warranty and personal auto were partially offset by growth in travel and accident & health.
underwriting income (loss) comparison for 2022 and 2021
underwriting income increased by $298 million primarily due to:
•higher net favorable prior year reserve development in 2022 compared to 2021 (2.4 points or $346 million), primarily as a result of lower unfavorable development in financial lines and higher favorable development in specialty, partially offset by lower favorable development in accident & health;
•a lower expense ratio (1.2 points) from a lower acquisition ratio (1.2 points) primarily driven by changes in business mix, improved commission terms and reinsurance program changes; and
•improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted (0.5 points) primarily driven by changes in business mix along with continued positive rate change, focused risk selection and improved terms and conditions.
these increases were partially offset by higher catastrophe losses (1.4 points or $188 million).

our business remains competitive due to its long-standing market leading positions, innovative products, distribution relationships across multiple channels, customer-focused service and strong financial ratings.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | life and retirement our primary challenges include:
•managing a rising rate environment. while a rising rate environment improves yields on new investment, improves margins on our business, and increases sales in certain products such as fixed annuities, it may also result in increased competition for certain products resulting in a need to increase crediting rates, and has resulted in lower separate account asset values for investments in fixed income which has reduced fee income;
•increased competition in our primary markets, including aggressive pricing of annuities by competitors, increased competition and consolidation of employer groups in the group retirement planning market, and competitors with different profitability targets in the pension risk transfer space as well as other product lines;
•increasingly complex new and proposed regulatory requirements, which have affected industry growth and costs; and
•upgrading our technology and underwriting processes while managing general operating expenses.
outlook-industry and economic factors below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our specific operating segments:
the worldwide health and economic impact of covid-19 continues to evolve, influenced by the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, including resurgences and variants of the virus as well as the distribution and effectiveness of vaccinations.
on december 15, 2021, aig and breit, a long-term, perpetual capital vehicle affiliated with blackstone, completed the acquisition by breit of aig's interests in a u.s. affordable housing portfolio. the historical results of the u.s. affordable housing portfolio were reported in our life and retirement operating segments.
for additional information on the separation of life and retirement please, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and part i, item 1a. risk factors - business and operations - "no assurances can be given that the separation of our life and retirement business will occur or as to the specific terms or timing thereof. in addition, we may not achieve the expected benefits of the separation and will have continuing equity market exposure to corebridge until we fully divest our stake."
individual retirement increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. the strong demand for fixed index and fixed annuities with guaranteed living benefit features has attracted increased competition in this product space. in response to the low interest rate environment that prevailed over the past several years we have developed guaranteed living benefits for variable, fixed index and fixed annuities with margins that are less sensitive to the level of interest rates.
changes in the capital markets (interest rate environment, credit spreads, equity markets, volatility) can have a significant impact on sales, surrender rates, investment returns, guaranteed income features, and net investment spreads in the annuity industry.
group retirement group retirement competes in the defined contribution market under the aig retirement services brand. aig retirement services is a leading retirement plan provider in the u.s. for k-12 schools and school districts, higher education, healthcare, government and other not-for-profit institutions. the defined contribution market is a highly efficient and competitive market that requires support for both plan sponsors and individual participants. to meet this challenge, aig retirement services is investing in a client- focused technology platform to support improved compliance and self-service functionality. aig retirement services' model pairs self-service tools with its employee financial advisors who provide individual plan participants with enrollment support and comprehensive financial planning services.
changes in the interest rates, credit spreads and equity market environment can have a significant impact on investment returns, fee income, advisory and other income, guaranteed income features, and net investment spreads, and a moderate impact on sales and surrender rates.
life insurance consumers have a significant need for life insurance, whether it is used for income replacement for their surviving family, estate planning or wealth transfer. additionally, consumers use life insurance to provide living benefits in case of chronic, critical or terminal illnesses, and to supplement retirement income.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | life and retirement in response to consumer needs and a changing interest rate environment, our life insurance product portfolio will continue to promote products with less long-duration interest rate risk and mitigate exposure to products that have long-duration interest rate risk through sales levels and hedging strategies.
as life insurance ownership remains at historical lows in the u.s. and the uk, efforts to expand the reach and increase the affordability of life insurance are critical. the industry is investing in consumer-centric efforts to reduce traditional barriers to securing life protection by simplifying the sales and service experience. digitally enabled processes and tools provide a fast, friendly and simple path to life insurance protection.
institutional markets institutional markets serves a variety of needs for corporate clients. demand is driven by a number of factors including the macroeconomic and regulatory environment. we expect to see continued growth in the pension risk transfer market (direct and assumed reinsurance) as corporate plan sponsors look to transfer asset or liability, longevity, administrative and operational risks associated with their defined benefit plans.
changes in interest rates and credit spreads can have a significant impact on investment returns and net investment spreads, impacting organic growth opportunities.

business and financial highlights adjusted pre-tax income (loss) comparison for 2022 and 2021
adjusted pre-tax income decreased $717 million primarily due to:
•lower net investment income, net of interest credited ($530 million) primarily driven by lower alternative investment income ($401 million), lower yield enhancement income ($285 million), partially offset by higher base portfolio income, net of interest credited ($156 million);
•higher dac amortization and policyholder benefits net of premiums, excluding the review and update of actuarial assumptions ($225 million) primarily due to lower variable annuity separate account returns; and
•lower policy and advisory fee income, net of advisory fee expenses ($219 million), primarily due to a decrease in variable annuity separate account assets driven by negative equity market performance and sale of retail mutual funds to touchstone.
partially offset by:
•net favorable impact from the review and update of actuarial assumptions ($184 million);
•lower interest expense on debt borrowings due to sale of affordable housing ($50 million); and
•lower non-deferred commissions ($46 million) due to a decrease in variable annuity separate account assets;

table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | life and retirement individual retirement gaap premiums, premiums and deposits, surrenders and net flows premiums and deposits is a non-gaap financial measure that includes, in addition to direct and assumed premiums, deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts and mutual funds under administration.

premiums and deposits and net flow comparison for 2022 and 2021
fixed annuities net outflows decreased ($2.0 billion) over the prior year, primarily due to higher premiums and deposits ($2.7 billion) due to competitive pricing and higher interest rates and lower death benefits ($300 million), partially offset by higher surrenders and withdrawals ($1.0 billion).
variable annuities net outflows increased ($807 million) primarily due to lower premiums and deposits ($1.9 billion), due to market volatility; partially offset by lower surrenders and withdrawals ($993 million) and lower death benefits ($116 million).
fixed index annuities net inflows increased ($450 million) primarily due to higher premiums and deposits ($695 million), due to competitive pricing and higher interest rates; partially offset by higher surrenders and withdrawals ($193 million) and higher death benefits ($52 million).
retail mutual funds there were no flows in 2022 due to the touchstone sale in the second quarter of 2021. for additional information regarding the sale of certain assets of the aig life and retirement retail mutual funds business, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

individual retirement annuities are typically subject to a three- to seven-year surrender charge period, depending on the product. for fixed annuities, the proportion of reserves subject to surrender charge at december 31, 2022 increased compared to december 31, 2021 primarily due to growth in business. for fixed index annuities, the proportion was slightly lower due to the aging of the business. the increase in the proportion of reserves with no surrender charge for variable annuities as of december 31, 2022 compared to december 31, 2021 was principally due to normal aging of business.

business and financial highlights adjusted pre-tax income (loss) comparison for 2022 and 2021
adjusted pre-tax income decreased $535 million primarily due to:
•lower net investment income, net of interest credited ($397 million) primarily driven by lower alternative investment income ($224 million), lower yield enhancement income ($158 million) and higher base portfolio income net of interest credited ($15 million);
•lower policy and advisory fee income, net of advisory fee expenses of ($94 million) due to lower fee based assets under administration as a result of lower equity market performance; and
•higher dac and sales inducement amortization and higher policyholder benefits, net of premiums mostly due to lower equity market performance ($61 million).

table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | life and retirement these decreases were partially offset by lower interest expense on debt borrowings due to sale of affordable housing ($29 million).
group retirement gaap premiums, premiums and deposits, surrenders and net flows premiums and deposits are a non-gaap financial measure that includes, in addition to direct and assumed premiums, deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts, fhlb funding agreements and mutual funds under administration.
net flows for annuity products included in group retirement represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. net flows for mutual funds represent deposits less withdrawals. client deposits into advisory and brokerage accounts less total client withdrawals from advisory and brokerage accounts, are not included in net flows, but do contribute to growth in assets under administration and advisory fee income.

premiums and deposits and net flow comparison for 2022 and 2021
net outflows decreased ($97 million) primarily due to higher premiums and deposits ($176 million), partially offset by higher death and payout annuity benefits of ($30 million), and higher surrenders and withdrawals of ($49 million). in general, net outflows are concentrated in fixed annuity products with higher contractual guaranteed minimum crediting rates. large plan acquisitions and surrenders resulted in higher net flows of ($121 million) compared to the prior year.

business and financial highlights adjusted pre-tax income (loss) comparison for 2022 and 2021
adjusted pre-tax income increased $231 million primarily due to:
•higher premiums and policy fees, net of policyholder benefits, excluding actuarial assumptions update ($509 million), primarily due to favorable mortality; and
•lower general operating expenses ($28 million).
partially offsetting this increase was:
•lower net investment income, net of interest credited ($214 million), primarily driven by lower alternative investment and yield enhancement income ($262 million) primarily due to lower equity partnership performance and reduced gains on calls, and higher base portfolio income, net of interest credited ($48 million); and
•lower net favorable impact from the review and update of actuarial assumptions ($82 million).

business and financial highlights adjusted pre-tax income (loss) comparison for 2022 and 2021
adjusted pre-tax income decreased $233 million primarily due to:
•lower net investment income ($103 million) primarily driven by lower alternative investment income ($145 million) and lower yield enhancement income ($89 million) partially offset by higher base portfolio income ($131 million);
•lower premiums primarily on new pension risk transfer business ($852 million); and
•higher interest credited on policyholder account balances, primarily related to the gic business ($46 million).
partially offsetting these decreases was a reduction in policyholder benefits and losses incurred (including interest accretion) primarily on new pension risk transfer business ($752 million).
institutional markets gaap premiums and premiums and deposits premiums for institutional markets primarily represent amounts received on pension risk transfer or structured settlement annuities with life contingencies. premiums decreased $852 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by the transactional nature of the pension risk transfer business (direct and assumed reinsurance).
premiums and deposits for institutional markets is a non-gaap financial measure that includes direct and assumed premiums as well as deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts. deposits primarily include gics, fhlb funding agreements and structured settlement annuities with no life contingencies.
premiums and deposits decreased $623 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to lower premiums on pension risk transfer business, partially offset by deposits of structured settlement annuities.

2022 and 2021 comparison adjusted pre-tax loss before consolidation and eliminations of $1.5 billion in 2022 compared to $1.4 billion in 2021, decrease of $124 million was primarily due to:
•lower net investment income associated with consolidated investment entities of $382 million partially offset by higher income on aig parent portfolio of $94 million due to higher yields and $56 million mark to market gain on the 2.46 percent equity interest in fortitude group holdings, llc;
•lower underwriting loss attributable to lower catastrophe losses of $38 million and absence of unfavorable prior year development ($86 million in 2021) within other operations run-off, primarily blackboard u.s. holdings, inc. (blackboard);
•lower corporate interest expense primarily driven by interest savings of $225 million from $9.4 billion debt repurchases, through cash tender offers, and debt redemption in 2022 as well as $92 million from $3.6 billion of debt redemptions and debt repurchases, through cash tender offers in 2021, partially offset by interest expense of $240 million on $6.5 billion corebridge senior unsecured notes, $1.5 billion draw down on corebridge ddtl facility and $1.0 billion junior subordinated debt issued by corebridge in 2022; and
•lower corporate and other general operating expenses of $45 million primarily driven by decreases in employment costs of $254 million partially offset by higher professional fees of $209 million.
adjusted pre-tax loss on consolidation and eliminations of $405 million in 2022 compared to $932 million in 2021, a decrease of $527 million, was primarily due to the elimination of the insurance companies' net investment income from their investment in the consolidated investment entities of $520 million.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | investments investments overview our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit by targeting an asset allocation mix that supports estimated cash flows of our outstanding liabilities and provides diversification from an asset class, sector, issuer, and geographic perspective. the primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus. the majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.
over the past several quarters inflation has continued to remain elevated, which has led to the increases in interest rates by the board of governors of the federal reserve system in several years. this has also led to a significant rise in interest rates across the yield curve and a widening of credit spreads reflecting ongoing recession concerns.
investment highlights in 2022
•a significant rise in interest rates and widening of credit spreads resulted in net unrealized losses in our available for sale fixed security portfolio of $47.7 billion during 2022. our net unrealized gain of $18.1 billion as of december 31, 2021 decreased to a net unrealized loss of $29.7 billion on our available for sale portfolio as of december 31, 2022.•we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities with favorable risk compared to return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.•we experienced a decrease in net investment income in 2022 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower returns in our private equity and hedge funds compared to gains in the prior year, and lower income in our available for sale fixed security portfolio primarily driven by lower call and prepayment income, which was partially offset by higher income in base portfolio.•blended investment yields on new investments are higher than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.
investment strategies investment strategies are assessed at the segment level and involve considerations that include local and general market and economic conditions, duration and cash flow management, risk appetite and volatility constraints, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, tax, regulatory and legal investment limitations, and, as applicable, environmental, social and governance considerations.
some of our key investment strategies are as follows:
•our fundamental strategy across the portfolios is to seek investments with similar characteristics to the associated insurance liabilities to the extent practicable.
•we seek to purchase investments that offer enhanced yield through illiquidity premiums, such as private placements and commercial mortgage loans, which also add portfolio diversification. these assets typically afford credit protections through covenants, ability to customize structures that meet our insurance liability needs, and deeper due diligence given information access.
•given our global presence, we seek investments that provide diversification from local markets. to the extent we purchase these investments, we generally hedge any currency risk using derivatives, which could provide opportunities to earn higher risk adjusted returns compared to investments in the functional currency.
•aig parent, included in other operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities, counterparties and duration. aig parent's liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash and short-term investments. this strategy allows us to both diversify our sources of liquidity and reduce the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.
•within the u.s., the life and retirement and general insurance investments are generally split between reserve backing and surplus portfolios.
-insurance reserves are backed mainly by investment grade fixed maturity securities that meet our duration, risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives. we assess asset classes based on their fundamental underlying risk factors, including credit (public and private), commercial real estate and residential real estate, regardless of whether such investments are bonds, loans, or structured products.
-surplus investments seek to enhance portfolio returns and are generally comprised of a mix of fixed maturity investment grade and below investment grade securities and various alternative asset classes, including private equity, real estate equity, and hedge funds. over the past few years, hedge fund investments have been reduced with more emphasis given to private equity, real estate and below investment grade credit.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | investments
•outside of the u.s., fixed maturity securities held by our insurance companies consist primarily of investment-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.
•we also utilize derivatives to manage our asset and liability duration as well as currency exposures.
asset-liability management the investment strategy within the general insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus, maintenance of sufficient liquidity for unanticipated insurance claims, and preservation of capital. general insurance invests primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. fixed maturity securities of the general insurance companies' north america operations have an average duration of 4.0 years. fixed maturity securities of the general insurance companies' international operations have an average duration of 3.2 years.
while invested assets backing reserves of the general insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional liquid fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate to asset classes that offer higher yields through structural and illiquidity premiums, particularly in our north america operations. in addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates and inflation. we seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes, sectors and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks.
in addition, a portion of the surplus of general insurance is invested in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments that seek to balance liquidity, volatility and growth of surplus. although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.
the investment strategy of the life and retirement companies is to provide net investment income to back liabilities that result in stable distributable earnings and enhance portfolio value, subject to asset-liability management, capital, liquidity and regulatory constraints.
the life and retirement companies use asset-liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. the life and retirement companies maintain a diversified, high-to-medium quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans that, to the extent practicable, match the duration characteristics of the liabilities. we seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes, sectors, and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks. the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, duration varies between distinct portfolios. the interest rate environment has a direct impact on the asset-liability management profile of the businesses, and changes in the interest rate environment may result in the need to lengthen or shorten the duration of the portfolio. in a rising rate environment, we may shorten the duration of the investment portfolio.
fixed maturity securities of the life and retirement companies' domestic operations have an average duration of 7.2 years.
in addition, the life and retirement companies seek to enhance surplus portfolio returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved returns in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio returns.
national association of insurance commissioners (naic) designations of fixed maturity securities the securities valuation office (svo) of the naic evaluates the investments of u.s. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called naic designations. in general, naic designations of '1' highest quality, or '2' high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while naic designations of '3' through '6' generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. naic designations for non-agency residential mortgage backed securities (rmbs) and commercial mortgage backed securities (cmbs) are calculated using third party modeling results provided through the naic. these methodologies result in an improved naic designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. the following tables summarize the ratings distribution of aig subsidiaries' fixed maturity security portfolio by naic designation, and the distribution by composite aig credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. for fixed maturity securities where no naic designation is assigned or able to be calculated using third-party data, the naic designation category used in the first table below reflects an internal rating.
the naic designations presented below do not reflect the added granularity to the designation categories adopted by the naic in 2020, which further subdivide each category of fixed maturity securities by appending letter modifiers to the numerical designations.

higher net realized capital gains excluding fortitude re funds withheld assets in 2022 compared to the prior year were due primarily to higher derivative gains, which was partially offset by losses in sales of securities versus gains in the prior year.
variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of related hedges, reflected higher gains in 2022 compared to the prior year. fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities due to the non-performance or "own credit" risk adjustment used in the valuation of the variable annuities with gmwb embedded derivative, which are not hedged as part of our economic hedging program, and other risk margins used for valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio.

net loss development - 2021
during 2021, we recognized favorable prior year loss reserve development of $115 million. the key components of this development were:
north america
•strong favorable development in personal insurance, primarily attributable to subrogation recovery related to the 2017 and 2018 california wildfires partially offset by the impact of dropping below the attachment point of our 2018 catastrophe aggregate treaty, which also adversely impacted our u.s. property and special risk commercial lines.
•favorable development on u.s. workers compensation and short-tailed commercial lines within other product lines, reflecting lower frequency and severity in recent calendar years.
•amortization benefit related to the deferred gain on the adverse development cover.
•reserve strengthening within u.s. financial lines, reflecting higher severity of claims in directors & officers, principally from accident years 2018 and prior, and cyber risk from accident years 2019 and 2020.
international
•favorable development on short-tailed international commercial lines and personal insurance, reflecting lower frequency and severity of claims.
•reserve strengthening on international financial lines, reflecting higher severity of claims, the majority of which is from accident years 2018 and prior.
other operations
•unfavorable development primarily attributed to the blackboard insurance portfolio due to increased severity on reported claims.
we note that for certain categories of claims (e.g., construction defect claims and environmental claims) and for reinsurance recoverable, losses may sometimes be reclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to us.
for information regarding the 2020 net loss development, see part ii, item 7. md&a - insurance reserves - loss reserves of our 2021 annual report.
significant reinsurance agreements in the first quarter of 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico, under which we transferred to nico 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our u.s. commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. under this agreement, we ceded to nico 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after january 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. we account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. this
98       aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves transaction resulted in a gain, which under gaap retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period. nico created a collateral trust account as security for their claim payment obligations to us, into which they deposited the consideration paid under the agreement, and berkshire hathaway inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure nico's obligations under the agreement.

the lines of business subject to this agreement include those with longer tails, which carry a higher degree of uncertainty. since inception, there have been periods of unfavorable prior year development, with more recent favorable development. this agreement will continue to reduce the impact of volatility in the development on our ultimate loss estimates over time. the agreement has resulted in lower capital charges for reserve risks at our u.s. insurance subsidiaries. in addition, net investment income declined as a result of lower invested assets.
fortitude re was established during the first quarter of 2018 in a series of reinsurance transactions related to our run-off operations. those reinsurance transactions were designed to consolidate most of our insurance run-off lines into a single legal entity. as of december 31, 2022, approximately $29.0 billion of reserves from our life and retirement run-off lines and approximately $3.2 billion of reserves from our general insurance run-off lines related to business written by multiple wholly-owned aig subsidiaries, had been ceded to fortitude re under these reinsurance transactions.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves of the fortitude re reinsurance agreements, the largest is the amended and restated combination coinsurance and modified coinsurance agreement by and between our subsidiary agl and fortitude re. under this treaty, approximately $22.1 billion of agl reserves as of december 31, 2022 were ceded to fortitude re representing a mix of life and annuity risks. fortitude re provides 100 percent reinsurance of the ceded risks. agl retains the risk of collection of any third party reinsurance covering the ceded business. at effectiveness of the treaty, an amount equal to the aggregate ceded reserves was deposited by agl into a modified coinsurance account of agl to secure the obligations of fortitude re. fortitude re receives or makes quarterly payments that represent the net gain or loss under the treaty for the relevant quarter, including any net investment gain or loss on the assets in the modified coinsurance account. since the effectiveness of the treaty, an aig affiliate has served as portfolio manager of the vast majority of the assets in the modified coinsurance account. in december 2022, the management of most of the public fixed income securities in the modified coinsurance account was transitioned to blackrock. in accordance with the terms of the treaty, following the third anniversary of the june 2, 2020 closing of the sale of our majority interest in fortitude group holdings, l.l.c., fortitude re has increased rights to direct the appointment of investment managers to manage the assets in the modified coinsurance account.

update of actuarial assumptions and models the life insurance companies review and update actuarial assumptions at least annually, generally in the third quarter.
investment-oriented products the life insurance companies review and update estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize dac and related items (which may include voba, dsi and unearned revenue reserves) as well as assessments used to accrue guaranteed benefit reserves at least annually. estimated gross profit projections include assumptions for investment-related returns and spreads (including investment expenses), product-related fees and expenses, mortality gains and losses, policyholder behavior and other factors. in estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on dac amortization. if the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, dac and related reserves are recalculated using the new projections, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. updating such projections may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.
the life insurance companies also review assumptions related to their respective gmwb living benefits that are accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value. the fair value of these embedded derivatives is based on actuarial assumptions, including policyholder behavior, as well as capital market assumptions.
various assumptions were updated, including the following effective september 30, 2022, which continued to be our best estimate assumptions as of december 31, 2022:
•expected lapses increased primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates for fixed annuities in individual retirement; and
•interest rates and equity correlation used to generate risk neutral path for variable annuities in individual retirement and group retirement decreased resulting in a reduction of gmwb embedded derivatives.
for information regarding actuarial methods, see critical accounting estimates - estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs and unearned revenue for investment-oriented products.
traditional long-duration products for long-duration traditional products, which include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long‐term care insurance, and life-contingent single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements, a "lock-in" principle applies. the assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and dac are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. a loss recognition event occurs when current liabilities together with expected future premiums are not sufficient to provide for all future benefits, expenses, and dac amortization, net of reinsurance. a loss recognition event is driven by observed changes in actual experience or estimates differing significantly from "locked-in" assumptions. underlying assumptions, including interest rates, are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate for loss recognition testing purposes. as it relates to business ceded to fortitude re, as our accounting policy is to include reinsurance balances when performing loss recognition testing and as there will be no future profits recognized on this business, we will not incur any future loss recognition events related to business ceded to fortitude re, absent any decisions by us to recapture the business. the net increases (decreases) to pre-tax income and adjusted pre-tax income as a result of the update of actuarial assumptions for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are shown in the following tables.

in 2022, adjusted pre-tax income included a net unfavorable update of $57 million, primarily in fixed annuities driven by the impact of higher interest rates on expected lapses.
in 2021, adjusted pre-tax income included a net unfavorable update of 166 million, primarily in fixed annuities driven by changes to earned rates causing spread compression partially offset by favorable updates to full surrender assumptions, and updates to the life insurance reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees and similar features (excluding base policy liabilities and embedded derivatives) model.
the updates related to the update of actuarial assumptions in each period are discussed by business segment below.
update of actuarial assumptions by business segment impact to adjusted pre-tax income (loss)
individual retirement the annual update of actuarial assumptions resulted in net unfavorable impact to adjusted pre-tax income of individual retirement of $86 million and $270 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
in 2022, in fixed annuities, the impact of higher interest rates on expected lapses resulted in a net unfavorable impact of $83 million. in 2021, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net unfavorable impact of $274 million which reflected lower projected investment earnings.
in 2022, in variable and index annuities, the update of assumptions resulted in a net unfavorable impact of $3 million due to a small model refinement. in 2021, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net favorable impact of $4 million, driven by lower assumed lapses. these updates were largely offset by lower projected investment earnings.
group retirement in 2022, in group retirement, the update of assumptions resulted in a net favorable impact of $2 million. in 2021, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net unfavorable impact of $2 million, driven primarily in the variable annuities line by lower projected investment earnings, largely offset by resetting the reversion to the mean rate.

variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results our individual retirement and group retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with gmwb riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features. the liabilities for gmwbs are accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value. the fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads, market volatility, policyholder behavior and other factors.
in addition to risk-mitigating features in our variable annuity product design, we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from gmwb, including exposures to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. the hedging program utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap and option contracts, as well as fixed maturity securities.
for additional information on market risk management related to these product features, see enterprise risk management - insurance risks - life and retirement companies' key risks - variable annuity, fixed index annuity and index universal life risk management and hedging programs.
differences in valuation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target the variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our gmwb riders. the economic hedge target differs from the gaap valuation of the gmwb embedded derivatives, creating volatility in our net income (loss) primarily due to the following:
•the economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations; the gaap valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero;
•the economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for gaap valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and
•the economic hedge target excludes the non-performance or "own credit" risk adjustment used in the gaap valuation, which reflects a market participant's view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating a different spread (the npa spread) to the curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows. because the gaap valuation includes the npa spread and other explicit risk margins, it has different sensitivities to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target. for additional information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits, see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. in addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the life and retirement companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. the primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include:
•basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative;
•realized volatility versus implied volatility;
•actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging, particularly policyholder behavior; and
•risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.

impact on pre-tax income (loss)
the impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of the gmwb embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, both of which are recorded in net realized gains (losses). realized gains (losses), as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities used in the hedging program, are excluded from adjusted pre-tax income of individual retirement and group retirement.
the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the gaap embedded derivatives and the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. when corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the npa spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a gain, and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten, the change in the npa spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a loss. in addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the npa spread, the npa balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits.

aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves the twelve-month period ended december 31, 2022 net impact on pre-tax income (loss) of $1.3 billion resulted from:
•$1.3 billion gain in the fair value of embedded derivatives excluding npa, net of the hedging portfolio was driven by increases in interest rates, partially offset by lower equity markets.
•$146 million loss due to npa was driven by the impact of higher interest rates that resulted in npa volume losses from lower expected gmwb payments, partially offset by a widening of the npa credit spread.
•$79 million gain from the review and update of actuarial assumptions.
on an economic basis, the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the changes in the economic hedge target. in the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, we had a net mark-to-market gain of approximately $714 million from our hedging activities related to our economic hedge target primarily driven by widening credit spreads and update of actuarial assumptions.
the twelve-month period ended december 31, 2021 net impact on pre-tax income (loss) of $18 million resulted from:
•$529 million gain in the fair value of embedded derivatives excluding npa, net of the hedging portfolio was driven by increases in interest rates and higher equity markets.
•$451 million loss due to npa was driven by a tightening of the npa credit spread, and the impact of higher interest rates that resulted in npa volume losses from lower expected gmwb payments.
•$60 million loss from the review and update of actuarial assumptions on an economic basis, the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the changes in the economic hedge target. in the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, we had a net mark-to-market gain of approximately $109 million from our hedging activities related to our economic hedge target primarily driven by higher equity markets, partially offset by losses from the review and update of actuarial assumptions.
change in economic hedge target the decrease in the economic hedge target liability in 2022 was primarily driven by higher interest rates and widening credit spreads, offset by lower equity markets. the decrease in the economic hedge target liability in 2021 was primarily driven higher interest rates and rising equity markets, partially offset by losses from the review and update of actuarial assumptions.
change in fair value of the hedging portfolio the changes in the fair value of the economic hedge target and, to a lesser extent, the embedded derivative valuation under gaap, were offset in part by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio:
•changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts, which included swaps, swaptions and futures, resulted in losses driven by higher interest rates in the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021.
•changes in the fair value of equity derivative contracts, which included futures and options, resulted in gains in 2022 driven by the decline in the equity market compared to losses in 2021, primarily due to gains in the equity market.
•changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, primarily corporate bonds, are used as a capital-efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread-related risk. the change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in 2022 reflected losses due to increases in interest rates and widening credit spreads. the change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in 2021 reflected losses due to higher interest rates.

(a)dac balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments was $10.0 billion, $10.5 billion and $10.5 billion at december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
the net impact to dac amortization from the update of actuarial assumptions for estimated gross profits, including those reported within change in dac related to net realized gains (losses), represented one percent and one percent of the dac balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
reversion to the mean the projected separate account returns on variable annuities use a reversion-to-the-mean (rtm) approach, under which we consider historical returns and adjust projected returns over an initial future period of five years so that returns converge to the long-term expected rate of return. as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, we assumed a 7% long-term expected rate of return. the criterion to review the five-year rtm anchor date is for the current rtm rate to be less than zero or more than double the long-term growth rate assumption for three consecutive months. when the anchor date is reset, the rtm rate is determined to be approximately one-half of the long-term rate. should market returns be significantly out of line with our expectations there are caps and floors that if breached would trigger a reassessment of the long-term rate and the rtm rate.
for additional discussion of assumptions related to our reversion to the mean methodology, see - update of actuarial assumptions and models and - critical accounting estimates - estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs and unearned revenue for investment-oriented products.
dac and reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments dac and reserves for universal life insurance and investment-oriented products are adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in dac, unearned revenue, and benefit reserves with an offset to other comprehensive income (loss) (oci) as if securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (changes related to unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments). similarly, for long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities with an offset to oci to be recorded.
changes related to unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments related to dac and unearned revenue generally move in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported dac and unearned revenue balance when market interest rates decline. conversely, changes related to unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments related to benefit reserves generally move in the same direction as the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, increasing reported future policy benefit liabilities balance when market interest rates decline.
market conditions in 2022 drove a $40.2 billion decrease in the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of the available for sale fixed maturity securities portfolio held to support the life and retirement businesses at december 31, 2022 compared to december 31, 2021. at december 31, 2022, the changes related to unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments reflected increases in amortized balances including dac and unearned revenue reserves, while accrued liabilities such as policyholder benefit liabilities decreased $3.0 billion from december 31, 2021. market conditions in the year ended december 31, 2021 drove a $7.4 billion decrease in the unrealized appreciation of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities portfolios held to support our insurance liabilities at december 31, 2021 compared to december 31, 2020. at december 31, 2021, the changes related to unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments reflected increases in amortized balances including dac and unearned revenue reserves, while accrued liabilities such as policyholder benefit liabilities decreased $0.9 billion from december 31, 2020.

aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources analysis of sources and uses of cash operating cash flow activities insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. the ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates, effective management of our investment portfolio and operating expense discipline.
interest payments totaled $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion in the twelve-month periods ended december 31, 2022 and 2021. excluding interest payments, aig had operating cash inflows of $5.3 billion in the twelve-month period ended december 31, 2022 compared to operating cash inflows of $7.6 billion in the prior year.

for information regarding cash flow activities for the year ended december 31, 2020, see part ii, item 7. md&a - liquidity and capital resources - analysis of sources and uses of cash of our 2021 annual report.
liquidity and capital resources of aig parent and subsidiaries aig parent as of december 31, 2022, aig parent and applicable intermediate holding companies had approximately $8.2 billion in liquidity sources held in the form of cash and short-term investments, and also includes aig parent's committed, revolving syndicated credit facility of $4.5 billion. as of december 31, 2021, aig parent and applicable intermediate holding companies had approximately $15.2 billion in liquidity sources held in the form of cash and short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities, and also includes aig parent's committed, revolving syndicated credit facility of $4.5 billion. following the initial public offering of corebridge, corebridge liquidity, including its loan facilities, is no longer reflected in aig parent's liquidity. as a public company shareholder of corebridge, aig receives its pro rata share of dividends paid by corebridge on corebridge common stock after its ipo. aig parent's primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities. aig parent's primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, operating expenses and dividends on aig common stock and series a preferred stock.
we expect to access the debt and preferred equity markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources we utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic or inorganic growth opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or aig common stock repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management.
insurance companies we expect that our insurance companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. our insurance companies' liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.
each of our material insurance companies' liquidity is monitored through various internal liquidity risk measures. the primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income and maturities. the primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, benefit claims, surrenders, withdrawals, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investment purchases and collateral requirements.
our insurance companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. for example, large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to the affected operations of our general insurance companies, and a shift in interest rates may require us to provide support to the affected operations of our life and retirement companies.
certain of our u.s. life and retirement insurance companies are members of the fhlbs in their respective districts. our borrowings from fhlbs are non-puttable and are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. our u.s. life and retirement companies had $4.6 billion and $3.6 billion which were due to fhlbs in their respective districts at december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, respectively, under funding agreements issued through our individual retirement, group retirement and institutional markets operating segments, which were reported in policyholder contract deposits. proceeds from funding agreements are generally invested in fixed income securities and other investments intended to generate spread income.
certain of our u.s. life and retirement companies have securities lending programs that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. under these programs, these companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. these companies had $3.3 billion of securities subject to these agreements at december 31, 2021 and $3.4 billion of liabilities to borrowers for collateral received at december 31, 2021. as of december 31, 2022 we had no loans outstanding under these programs.
aig parent and/or certain subsidiaries are parties to several letter of credit agreements with various financial institutions, which issue letters of credit from time to time in support of our insurance companies. these letters of credit are subject to reimbursement by aig parent and/or certain subsidiaries in the event of a drawdown of these letters of credit. letters of credit issued in support of the general insurance companies totaled approximately $3.4 billion at december 31, 2022. letters of credit issued in support of the life and retirement companies totaled approximately $272 million at december 31, 2022, which are subject to reimbursement by corebridge with no recourse to aig parent.
on november 1, 2021, corebridge declared a dividend payable to aig parent in the amount of $8.3 billion. in connection with such dividend, corebridge issued the intercompany note, which, as of september 15, 2022, was repaid in full by corebridge.
following the initial public offering of corebridge, aig holds 77.7 percent of corebridge common stock, resulting in the tax deconsolidation of corebridge from aig. as such, as of september 15, 2022, aig is no longer receiving tax sharing payments from corebridge for tax liabilities of subsequent periods. pursuant to the tax matters agreement entered into by corebridge and aig on september 14, 2022, the parties will make tax payments to each other in respect of historic tax periods and tax periods prior to the tax deconsolidation of corebridge from aig in a manner consistent with pre-existing tax sharing arrangements between the companies.
credit facilities aig parent maintains a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the facility) with aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide aig parent with unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings. the facility is scheduled to expire in november 2026.
our ability to utilize the facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the facility. these include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the facility would restrict our access to the facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
as of december 31, 2022, a total of $4.5 billion remained available under the facility.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources corebridge maintains a revolving syndicated credit facility (the corebridge facility) with aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide corebridge with unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $2.5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and with no recourse to aig parent. the corebridge facility is scheduled to expire in may 2027.
as of december 31, 2022, a total of $2.5 billion remained available under the corebridge facility.
corebridge also maintains a 3-year delayed draw term loan agreement (the ddtl facility) with aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide corebridge with delayed draw term loans of up to $1.5 billion, with no recourse to aig parent. on september 15, 2022, corebridge borrowed $1.5 billion under the ddtl facility, a portion of which was used to repay the remaining amount due to aig parent under the intercompany note. the ddtl facility is scheduled to mature in february 2025.
as of december 31, 2022, a total of $1.5 billion of borrowings are outstanding under the ddtl facility.

(a)represents loss reserves, undiscounted and gross of reinsurance.
(b)does not reflect $5.9 billion of debt of consolidated investment entities, for which recourse is limited to the assets of the respective investment entities and for which there is no recourse to the general credit of aig. in addition, on september 15, 2022, corebridge borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion under the 3-year ddtl facility through october 20, 2022. corebridge continued this borrowing through june 21, 2023 and has the ability to further continue this borrowing through the final maturity date of the ddtl facility on february 25, 2025.
loss reserves loss reserves relate to our general insurance companies and represent estimates of future loss and loss adjustment expense payments based on historical loss development payment patterns. the amounts presented in the above table are undiscounted and therefore exceed the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including allowance for credit losses, as presented on the consolidated balance sheets. due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. we believe that our general insurance companies maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations.
for additional information on loss reserves, see critical accounting estimates - loss reserves and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
insurance and investment contract liabilities insurance and investment contract liabilities, including gic liabilities, relate to our life and retirement companies. these liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments. these liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. for these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control.
we have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. the amounts presented in the above table are undiscounted and therefore exceed the liabilities for future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts, and policyholder contract deposits included in the consolidated balance sheets. due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments.
we believe that our life and retirement companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations.

we are party to some agreements that contain "ratings triggers." depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.
in the event of a downgrade of aig's long-term senior debt ratings, certain aig entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative and other transactions, or certain of the counterparties of such aig entities would be permitted to terminate such transactions early.
the actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.

aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management enterprise risk management overview we consider risk management an integral part of our business strategy and a key element of our approach to corporate governance. we have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. our board of directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. our enterprise risk management department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of aig's major risk positions. erm embeds risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, monitoring, reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by aig. nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur. for further information regarding the risks associated with our business and operations, see part i, item 1a. risk factors.
aig employs a three lines of defense model. aig's business leaders assume full accountability for the risks and controls in their operating units, and erm performs a review, challenge and oversight function. the third line consists of our internal audit group that provides independent assurance to aig's board of directors.
risk governance structure our risk governance structure fosters the development and maintenance of a risk and control culture that encompasses all significant risk categories impacting our lines of business and functions. accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual business leaders, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit. we review our governance and committee structure on a regular basis and make changes as appropriate to continue to effectively manage and govern both our risks and risk-taking activities.
our board of directors oversees the management of risk through its risk and capital committee (rcc) and audit committee. these committees regularly interact with other committees of the board of directors which are further described below. our chief risk officer (cro) reports to both the rcc and our chairman and chief executive officer. our cro is also a member of the executive leadership team providing erm the opportunity to contribute to, review, monitor and consider the impact of changes in strategy.
the group risk committee (grc): the grc is the senior management group responsible for assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis to protect our financial strength and reputation. the grc is chaired by our cro. our cro reports periodically on behalf of the grc to both the rcc and the audit committee of the board of directors.
the grc is supported by management committees including the business unit risk committees and legal entity risk committees. these committees are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout aig and its subsidiaries. these committees are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates. in addition, various working groups are in place in support of the grc to manage and monitor the various risks across the organization.
risk appetite, limits, identification and measurement risk appetite framework our risk appetite framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. we balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. the framework includes our risk appetite statement approved by the board of directors and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources.
these measures are set at the aig parent level as well as the legal entity level and cover consolidated and insurance company capital and liquidity ratios. our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs. the grc routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. a consolidated risk report is also presented periodically to the rcc by our cro.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management risk limits a key component of our risk appetite framework is having a process in place that establishes and maintains appropriate tolerances and limits on the material risks identified for our core businesses and facilitates the monitoring and meeting of both internal and external stakeholder expectations.
to support the monitoring and management of aig's and its business units' material risks, erm has an established limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:
•board-level risk tolerances are aig's aggregate consolidated capital and liquidity limits. they define the minimum level of consolidated capital and liquidity that we should maintain. these board-level risk tolerances are approved by the board of directors and monitored by the rcc.
•aig management level limits are risk type specific limits at the aig consolidated level. these limits are approved by our cro with consultation from the grc.
•business unit and legal entity level limits are set to address key risks identified for the business unit and legal entities, protect capital and liquidity at legal entities and/or meet legal entity specific requirements of regulators and rating agencies. these limits are defined by the business unit and legal entity risk officers.
all limits are reviewed by the grc or relevant business unit risk committees on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees. limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality.
risk identification and measurement we conduct risk identification through multiple processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks. a key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process which is conducted down to the product-line level. in addition, we perform an annual top-down risk assessment to identify top risks and assign owners to ensure these risks are appropriately addressed and managed. these processes are used as critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.
we employ various approaches to measure, monitor and manage risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. we use a proprietary internal capital and stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks.
the internal capital framework quantifies our aggregate economic risk at a given confidence interval, after taking into account diversification benefits between risk factors and business lines. we leverage the internal capital framework to help inform our consolidated risk consumption and profile as well as risk and capital allocation for our businesses.
the stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risks in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our non-insurance company subsidiaries, and risks to aig consolidated capital. we use this information to support the assessment of resources needed at the aig parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.
we evaluate and manage risk in material topics as discussed below.
•credit risk management       •liquidity risk management          •insurance risks
•market risk management       •operational risk management credit risk management credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty's credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads.
direct and indirect credit exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, securities purchased under agreements to resell and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance and retrocessional insurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees, letters of credit, and certain general insurance businesses.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management our credit risks are managed by teams of credit professionals, subject to erm oversight and various control processes. erm is primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework. our credit risk framework incorporates risk identification and measurement, risk limits, risk delegations to authorized credit professionals throughout the company, and credit reserving. credit reserving includes but is not limited to the development of a proper framework, policies and procedures for establishing accurate identification of (i) reserves for credit losses and (ii) other-than-temporary impairments for securities portfolios.
we monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. to minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. we treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. we also closely monitor the quality of any trust collateral accounts.
for additional information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures, see investments - credit ratings - available-for-sale investments.
derivative transactions we utilize derivatives principally to enable us to hedge exposure associated with changes in levels of interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities, equity prices and other risks. credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. all derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by erm.
we evaluate counterparty credit quality via an internal analysis that is consistent with the aig credit policy. we require credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and transaction size and maturity. furthermore, we enter into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as isda master agreements. these provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, we can set off receivables from a counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. as a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated fair values.
for additional information related to derivative transactions, see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
market risk management market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their respective levels of volatility.
we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and the liability sides of our balance sheet through on- and off-balance sheet exposures. the scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in the above mentioned market risk drivers.
many of our market risk exposures, including exposures to changes in levels of interest rates and equity prices, are associated with the asset and liability exposures of our life and retirement companies. these exposures are generally long-term in nature. also, we have equity market risk sensitive surrenders in our variable annuity product portfolio. these interactive asset-liability types of risk exposures are regularly monitored in accordance with the risk governance framework noted above.
market risk is overseen at the corporate level within erm through the cro. market risk is managed by our finance, treasury and investment management corporate functions, collectively, and in partnership with erm.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management market risk drivers:
equity prices                                         we are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of equity-linked capital market instruments and insurance products, including but not limited to the valuation of publicly traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, alternative risk premia investment strategies, variable annuities, indexed universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.
residential and commercial real estate values         our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. changes in real estate prices can affect the valuation of mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include real estate mortgages, trusts that include real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance and reinsurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.
interest rates                                        interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make some of our product offerings less attractive to investors. conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. when rates rise quickly, there can be an asymmetric gaap accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value and the offsetting decrease in the value of certain liabilities may not be recognized. changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, and insurance contracts. additionally, for variable annuity, index annuity, and equity indexed universal life products, deviations in actual versus expected policyholder behavior can be driven by fluctuations in various market variables, including interest rates. policies with guaranteed living benefit options or riders are also subject to the risk of actual benefit utilization being different than expected.
credit spreads                                        credit spreads measure an instrument's risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument. changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, asset backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, aig-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives, derivative credit valuation adjustments and economic valuation of insurance liabilities. wider credit spreads paired with unchanged expectations about default losses imply higher investment income in the long term. in the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities. a precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.
foreign exchange (fx) rates                           as a globally diversified enterprise, changes in fx rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.
commodity prices                                      changes in commodity prices can affect the valuation of publicly-traded commodities and commodity indices, derivatives on commodities and commodity indices, and other commodity-linked investments and insurance contracts. we are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers' debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio.
inflation                                             changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including aig-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.
our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures.
we monitor risks through multiple lenses that include economic, gaap and statutory reporting frameworks at various levels of business consolidation. this process aims to establish a comprehensive coverage of potential implications from adverse market risk developments. we use a number of approaches to measure market risk exposure including sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis and stress testing.

interest rate sensitivity is defined as the change in value with respect to a 100 basis point parallel shift up in the interest rate environment, calculated as: scenario value minus base value, where base value is the value under the yield curves as of the period end and scenario value is the value reflecting a 100 basis point parallel increase in all yield curves.
we evaluate our interest rate risk without considering effects of correlation of changes in levels of interest rate with other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the values of our financial assets and liabilities.
we evaluate our equity price risk without considering effects of correlation of changes in equity prices with other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the values of our financial assets and liabilities, as the stress scenario does not reflect the impact of basis risk which we use in the development of our hedging strategy.
the risk monitoring responsibilities, owned by the business units, include ensuring compliance with market risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. such activities must be reported to the erm market risk team by the relevant business unit. this monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.
for additional information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits, see risk appetite, limits, identification and measurement - risk limits.
liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations as they come due.
aig and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity both during the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due.
aig parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow us to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario. we maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under stress conditions. if we project that we could breach these tolerances, we assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. however, market or other conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.
liquidity risk is overseen at the corporate level within erm. the cro has responsibility for the oversight of the liquidity risk management framework and delegates the day-to-day implementation of this framework to the aig treasurer. our treasury function manages liquidity risk, subject to erm oversight and various control processes. our liquidity risk management framework includes liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address aig-specific, broader industry and market-related liquidity events.
types of liquidity and funding risks:
market/monetization risk         assets may not be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values or necessary volumes to meet liquidity needs.
cash flow mismatch risk          discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.
event funding risk               event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.
financing risk                   we may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, aig-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.
comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. we produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. in addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity. we use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure including minimum liquidity limits, coverage ratios, coverage flow forecasts, and stress testing.
relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to aig parent and business unit risk committees. the frequency, content, and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity, based on its complexity, risk profile, activities and size.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management operational risk management operational risk is defined as the risk of loss, or other adverse consequences, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events. operational risk includes legal, regulatory, technology, compliance, third-party and business continuity risks, but excludes business and strategy risks.
operational risk is inherent in each of our business units and functions and can have many impacts, including but not limited to: unexpected economic losses or gains, reputational harm due to negative publicity, regulatory action from supervisory agencies and operational and business disruptions, and/or damage to customer relationships.
the operational risk management (orm) function within erm oversees adherence to the operational risk policy and risk and control framework, which includes risk identification, assessment, measurement, management and monitoring of operational risk exposures. in line with the three lines of defense model, the orm program includes, but is not limited to, issue/risk event capture, analysis and treatment, risk assessments, and key risk indicators.
orm, working together with other control and assurance functions (e.g., compliance, financial controls unit, enterprise resiliency, and internal audit) through the risk and control framework, provides an independent view of operational risks for each business, and works with the business units, corporate functions, and the first line risk and control owners.
cybersecurity risk aig, like other global companies, continues to witness the increased sophistication and activities of unauthorized parties attempting cyber and other computer-related penetrations such as "denial of service" attacks, phishing, untargeted but sophisticated and automated attacks, and other disruptive software in an effort to compromise systems, networks and obtain sensitive information. cybersecurity risks may also derive from unintentional human error or intentional malice on the part of aig employees or third parties who have authorized access to aig's systems or information.
erm works closely with and supports the risk management practices of information technology, the information security office and the business units and functions that form the lines of defense against the cybersecurity risks that we face.
aig's board of directors is regularly briefed by management on aig's cybersecurity matters, including threats, policies, practices and ongoing efforts to improve security. for additional information regarding the privacy data protection and cybersecurity regulations to which we are subject, see part i, item 1. business - regulation - privacy, data protection and cybersecurity. for additional discussion of cybersecurity risks, see part i, item 1a. risk factors - business and operations.
insurance risks insurance risk is defined as the risk of actual claims experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than initially expected at the inception of an insurance contract. uncertainties related to insurance risk can lead to deviations in magnitude and/or timing of prospective cash flows associated with our liabilities compared to what we expected.
we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. a primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. to achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.
we operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. we manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of processes and procedures, including, but not limited to:
•pricing and risk selection models including regular monitoring;
•pricing approval processes;
•pre-launch approval of product design, development and distribution;
•underwriting approval processes and authorities;
•modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels (policy, line of business, product group, country, individual/group, correlation and catastrophic risk events);
•risk transfer tools such as reinsurance, both internal and third-party;
•review and challenge of reserves to ensure comprehensive analysis with established escalation procedures to provide appropriate transparency in reserving decisions and judgments made in the establishment of reserves;
•management of relationship between assets and liabilities, including hedging;
•model risk management framework and validation processes;
•actuarial profitability and reserve reviews; and
•experience monitoring and assumption updates.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management we closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each underwritten line of business, concentrations in industries, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. we analyze concentrations of risks using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.
risk measurement, monitoring and limits we use a number of approaches to measure our insurance risk exposure including sensitivity and scenario analyses, stochastic methods, and experience studies. additionally, there are risk-specific assessment tools, both internal and third-party, in place to better manage the variety of insurance risks to which we are exposed.
we monitor concentrations of exposure through insurance limits and thresholds aggregated along dimensions such as geography, industry, or counterparty.
the risk monitoring responsibilities of the business units include ensuring compliance with insurance risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. such activities are reported to management by all business units for informative decision-making on a regular basis. this monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.
for additional information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits, see risk appetite, limits, identification and measurement - risk limits.
general insurance companies' key risks we manage our risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. this management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance. underwriting practices and pricing procedures incorporate historical experience, changes in underlying exposure, current regulation and judicial decisions as well as proposed or anticipated regulatory changes or societal trends.
for general insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:
•loss reserves - the potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the general insurance companies. we manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. for further information, see critical accounting estimates - loss reserves.
•underwriting - the potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the general insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. we develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit.
•catastrophe exposure - our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. natural disasters, man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.
•single risk loss exposure - our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. the net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the chief underwriting officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance.
•reinsurance - since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the recoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. the inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.
natural catastrophe risk we manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate probable maximum loss (pml) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.
we use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. we apply adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management we recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. with multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. in addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.
the table below details our modeled estimates of pml, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. the 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 pmls are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. estimates as of december 31, 2022 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of october 1, 2022, except for aig re with exposures as of january 1, 2023, and all inuring reinsurance covers as of december 31, 2022, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of january 1, 2023 and reflected as of such date.

(f)taxed at the statutory tax rate of 21 percent for both the u.s. and japanese modeled losses. the majority of japan exposures are ceded to our u.s. pool.
aig, along with other property casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, uses industry-recognized catastrophe models and applies proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. since there is no industry standard for assumptions and preparation of insured data for use in these models, our modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.
also, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements. however, reinsurance recoverables may not be fully collectible. therefore, these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our net exposure, inclusive of credit risk, to these events.
our 2023 property catastrophe reinsurance program is a worldwide program providing both aggregate and per occurrence protection, with differing per occurrence and aggregate retentions for north america, japan, and rest of world. in 2023, we made changes to our north america property catastrophe reinsurance program to reflect our improving portfolio with attachment points of $500 million for commercial portfolio and $300 million for lexington and programs business. our property catastrophe treaty per occurrence structures largely stayed the same as 2022 for international, with japan's retention unchanged from prior year at $200 million and rest of world attachment point of $125 million.
we have also purchased property per risk covers that provide protection against large losses globally, which include those emanating from non-critical catastrophe events (all events except for named windstorm and earthquake) globally as well as critical catastrophe events (named windstorm and earthquake) outside north america.
actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. the occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
for additional information, see also part 1, item 1a. risk factors - reserves and exposures.
terrorism risk we actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the general insurance companies' exposures.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management our largest terrorism concentrations are in new york city, and estimated losses are largely driven by the property and workers' compensation lines of business. our exposure to terrorism risk in the u.s. is mitigated by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act (tripra) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. tripra covers certified terrorist attacks within the u.s. or u.s. missions and against certain u.s. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law.
we offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. international terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. we also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-u.s. jurisdictions.
life and retirement companies' key risks we manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing and underwriting discipline, risk limits and thresholds, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the alignment between risk and cash flow profiles of assets and liabilities, and hedging instruments.
for life and retirement companies, risks include the following:
•longevity risk - represents the risk of an increase in liabilities associated with an insurance product, e.g. an annuity policy or a payout benefit as a result of actual mortality experience being lower than the expected mortality experience. this risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our annuity products.
•morbidity risk - represents the risk arising from actual morbidity (e.g. illness, disability or disease) incidence rate being higher than expected or the length of the claims extending longer than expected resulting in a higher overall benefit payout. this risk exists in a number of our product lines such as individual and group accident and health and long-term care businesses which for the most part are in run-off, and ceded to fortitude re.
•mortality (including pandemic) risk - represents the risk of unexpected loss arising from current actual mortality experience being higher than expected mortality experience. this risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.
•policyholder behavior risk (including full and partial surrender/lapses) - represents the risk that actual policyholder behavior differs from expected behavior in a manner that has an adverse effect on our operating results. there are many related assumptions made when products are sold, including how long the contracts will persist and other assumptions which impact the expected utilization of contract benefits, options and guarantees. actual experience can vary significantly from these assumptions. this risk is impacted by a number of factors including changes in personal policyholder situations and market conditions, especially changes in the levels of yields, equity prices, tax law, regulations, competitive landscape and policyholder preferences.
the emergence of significant adverse experience compared to the experience we expected and priced for could require an adjustment to benefit reserves and/or dac, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations for a particular period.
for additional information on the impact of actual and expected experience on dac and benefit reserves, see critical accounting estimates - future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and critical accounting estimates - guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity, fixed annuity and fixed index annuity products. for additional information on business risks, see part i, item 1a. risk factors - business and operations.
variable annuity, fixed index annuity and index universal life risk management and hedging programs our individual and group retirement businesses offer variable and fixed index annuity products with guaranteed living benefit (glb) riders that guarantee a certain level of lifetime benefits. under current gaap rules, variable and certain index annuity glbs are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in other realized gains (losses). glb features subject the life and retirement companies to market risk, including exposure to changes in levels of interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.
product design is the first step in managing our exposure to these market risks. risk mitigation features of our variable annuity product designs include glb rider fees indexed to a broad equity market volatility index, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts to reduce overall equity exposure, and for some of the variable annuity products, the utilization of volatility control funds.
we utilize asset liability management and hedging programs to manage economic exposure to market risks that are not fully mitigated through product designs. our hedging program is designed to offset certain changes in the economic value of embedded derivatives associated with our variable annuity, index annuity and index universal life liabilities, within established thresholds. the hedging program is designed to provide additional protection against large and combined movements in levels of interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility under multiple scenarios.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management our hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents our estimate of the underlying economic risks in the embedded derivatives. the hedge target is established via a stochastic projection. this stochastic projection method uses best estimate assumptions for policyholder behavior in conjunction with market scenarios calibrated to observable equity and interest rate option prices. policyholder behaviors are regularly evaluated to compare current assumptions to actual experience and, if appropriate, changes are made to the policyholder behavior assumptions. the risk of changes in policyholder behavior is not explicitly hedged, and such differences between expected and actual policyholder behaviors will result in hedge ineffectiveness.
due to differences between the calculation of the value of the economic hedge target and the u.s. gaap valuation of the embedded derivative, we expect relative movements in the economic hedge target and the u.s. gaap embedded derivative valuation will vary over time with changes in levels of equity markets, interest rates, credit spreads and volatility.
for information on the impact on our consolidated pre-tax income from the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives and the hedging portfolio, as well as additional discussion of differences between the economic hedge target and the valuation of the embedded derivatives, see insurance reserves - life and annuity future policy benefits, policyholder contract deposits and dac - variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results.
in designing the hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions that are used in projections of future performance of the underlying mutual funds elected by the variable annuity policyholders. we use these assumptions to project future policy level account value changes. we map the mutual funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. basis risk exists due to the variance between funds returns projected under these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the value of the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic value of the hedge liability target. net hedge results and the associated cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.
our hedging programs associated with index annuity and index universal life products, are designed to manage market risk associated with the index crediting strategies offered on these product platforms. similarly, as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the value of the economic liability hedge target and the u.s. gaap valuation of the index annuity and index universal life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.
to manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic liability hedge targets, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset corresponding sensitivities in the associated economic hedge targets, within internally defined threshold limits. since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits. as such, periodic adjustments are made to the hedging portfolio in order to return the net exposure to within the threshold limits.
our hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions. in addition, within the variable annuities hedging program, we purchase certain fixed income securities classified as available for sale. to minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of the derivative instruments utilized within the hedging programs are cleared through global exchanges. over the counter derivatives utilized within the hedging programs are subject to two-way collateralization, managed under a net zero collateral threshold.
the hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic liability hedge targets and the associated derivative portfolios stay within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedging strategies. in addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program's effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. finally, hedging strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.
reinsurance activities we purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. we may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis. pooling of our reinsurance risks enables us to purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks.
reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (life and non-life) exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. in addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.
aig | 2022 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management reinsurance markets include:
•traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the united states, bermuda, london and europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;
•capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and
•other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.
the form of reinsurance we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:
•proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premiums and losses to reinsurers;
•non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or
•facultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.
we continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.
reinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. however, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.
in certain markets, we are required to participate on a proportional basis in reinsurance pools based on our relative share of direct writings in those markets. such mandatory reinsurance generally covers higher-risk consumer exposures such as assigned-risk automobile and earthquake, as well as certain commercial exposures such as workers' compensation.
reinsurance recoverable aig's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and life and annuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).
at december 31, 2022, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $71.6 billion. these assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $4.4 billion, ceded loss reserves of $32.2 billion including reserves for ibnr claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $30.7 billion. the methods used to estimate ibnr and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. these methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. any adjustments are reflected in income. we believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at december 31, 2022 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. actual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.
the reinsurance credit department (rcd) conducts periodic detailed assessments of the financial strength and condition of current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. the rcd monitors both the financial condition of reinsurers as well as the total reinsurance recoverable ceded to reinsurers, and sets limits with regard to the amount and type of exposure we are willing to take with reinsurers. as part of these assessments, we attempt to identify whether a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, assess its financial capacity and liquidity, and evaluate the local economic and financial environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. the rcd reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for measures, including collateral to mitigate credit risk. for example, in our treaty reinsurance contracts, we frequently include provisions that require a reinsurer to post collateral or use other measures to reduce exposure when a referenced event occurs. furthermore, we limit our unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers such as insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in regulatory capital, or relevant rbc ratios fall below certain levels. we also set maximum limits for reinsurance recoverable exposure, which in some cases is the recoverable amount plus an estimate of the maximum potential exposure from unexpected events for a reinsurer. in addition, credit executives within erm review reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approve reinsurer credit limits above specified levels. finally, even where we conclude that uncollateralized credit risk is acceptable, we require collateral from active reinsurance counterparties where it is necessary for our subsidiaries to recognize the reinsurance recoverable assets for statutory accounting purposes. at december 31, 2022, we held $74.3 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.
at december 31, 2022, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility and catastrophe losses (including covid-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. the rcd, in conjunction with the credit executives within erm, reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require the reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.

executive summary introduction biogen is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and delivering innovative therapies for people living with serious and complex diseases worldwide. we have a broad portfolio of medicines to treat ms, have introduced the first approved treatment for sma and co-developed two treatments to address a defining pathology of alzheimer's disease. we are focused on advancing our pipeline in neurology, neuropsychiatry, specialized immunology and rare diseases. we support our drug discovery and development efforts through internal research and development programs and external collaborations.
our marketed products include tecfidera, vumerity, avonex, plegridy, tysabri and fampyra for the treatment of ms; spinraza for the treatment of sma; aduhelm for the treatment of alzheimer's disease; and fumaderm for the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis. we also collaborate with eisai on the commercialization of leqembi for the treatment of alzheimer's disease, which was granted accelerated approval by the fda in january 2023. we have certain business and financial rights with respect to rituxan for the treatment of non-hodgkin's lymphoma, cll and other conditions; rituxan hycela for the treatment of non-hodgkin's lymphoma and cll; gazyva for the treatment of cll and follicular lymphoma; ocrevus for the treatment of ppms and rms; lunsumio (mosunetuzumab), which was granted accelerated approval in the u.s. during the fourth quarter of 2022 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma; glofitamab, an investigational bispecific antibody for the potential treatment of non-hodgkin's lymphoma; and have the option to add other potential anti-cd20 therapies, pursuant to our collaboration arrangements with genentech, a wholly-owned member of the roche group.
in addition to continuing to invest in new potential innovation in ms and sma we are advancing our mid-to-late stage programs including zuranolone for mdd and ppd, biib080 for alzheimer's disease, tofersen for als and both litifilimab and dapirolizumab pegol for certain forms of lupus.
we also commercialize biosimilars of advanced biologics including benepali, an etanercept biosimilar referencing enbrel, imraldi, an adalimumab biosimilar referencing humira, and flixabi, an infliximab biosimilar referencing remicade, in certain countries in europe, as well as byooviz, a ranibizumab biosimilar referencing lucentis, in the u.s. we continue to develop potential biosimilar products including biib800, a proposed tocilizumab biosimilar referencing actemra, and sb15, a proposed aflibercept biosimilar referencing eylea. in february 2023 we announced that we are exploring strategic options for our biosimilars business.
for additional information on our collaboration arrangements, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
we seek to ensure an uninterrupted supply of medicines to patients around the world. to that end, we continually review our manufacturing capacity, capabilities, processes and facilities. in order to support our future growth and drug development pipeline, we are expanding our large molecule production capacity by building a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in solothurn, switzerland. in the second quarter of 2021 a portion of the facility received a gmp multi-product license from swissmedic. solothurn has been approved for the manufacture of aduhelm and leqembi by the fda. we estimate the second manufacturing suite at the solothurn facility will be operational by the end of 2023. we believe that the solothurn facility will support our anticipated near-term needs for the manufacturing of biologic assets. if we are unable to fully utilize our manufacturing facilities, due to lower than forecasted demand for our products, we will incur excess capacity charges which will have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
our revenue depends upon continued sales of our products as well as the financial rights we have in our anti-cd20 therapeutic programs, and, unless we develop, acquire rights to and/or commercialize new products and technologies, we will be substantially dependent on sales from our products and our financial rights in our anti-cd20 therapeutic programs for many years.
in the longer term, our revenue growth will depend upon the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and launch of new commercial table of contents products as well as additional indications for our existing products, our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other rights related to our marketed products, assets originating from our research and development efforts and/or successful execution of external business development opportunities.
business environment for a detailed discussion on our business environment, please read item 1. business, included in this report. for additional information on our competition and pricing risks that could negatively impact our product sales, please read item 1a. risk factors, included in this report.
aduhelm (aducanumab)
u.s.
in june 2021 the fda granted accelerated approval of aduhelm, which, until march of 2022, we had been collaborating on with eisai, based on reduction in amyloid beta plaques observed in patients treated with aduhelm. as part of the accelerated approval, we are required to conduct a confirmatory trial to verify the clinical benefit of aduhelm in patients with alzheimer's disease. the fda may withdraw approval if, among other things, the confirmatory trial fails to verify clinical benefit of aduhelm, aduhelm's benefit-risk is no longer positive or we fail to comply with the conditions of the accelerated approval.
in april 2022 the cms released a final ncd for the class of anti-amyloid treatments in alzheimer's disease, including aduhelm. the final ncd confirmed coverage with evidence development, in which patients with medicare can only access treatment if they are part of an approved clinical trial. this decision effectively resulted in denying all medicare beneficiaries access to aduhelm. we expect that this decision will reduce future demand for aduhelm to a minimal level.
during the first quarter of 2022, as a result of the final ncd, we recorded approximately $275.0 million of charges associated with the write-off of inventory and purchase commitments in excess of forecasted demand related to aduhelm. additionally, for the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $111.0 million of aggregate gross idle capacity charges related to aduhelm. these charges were recorded in cost of sales within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2022.
we have recognized approximately $197.0 million related to eisai's 45.0% share of inventory, idle capacity charges and contractual commitments in collaboration profit (loss) sharing within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2022.
additionally, as a result of the final ncd we have substantially eliminated our commercial infrastructure supporting aduhelm, retaining minimal resources to manage patient access programs, including a continued free drug program for patients currently on treatment in the u.s.
we expect to continue funding certain regulatory and research and development activities for aduhelm, including the continuation of the embark re-dosing study and the phase 4 post-marketing requirement study, envision. additional actions regarding aduhelm may be informed by upcoming data readouts expected for this class of antibodies, as well as further engagement with the fda and cms.
on march 14, 2022, we amended our aduhelm collaboration agreement with eisai. as of the amendment date, we have sole decision making and commercialization rights worldwide on aduhelm, and beginning january 1, 2023, eisai receives only a tiered royalty based on net sales of aduhelm, and no longer participates in sharing aduhelm's global profits and losses. eisai's share of development, commercialization and manufacturing expense was limited to $335.0 million for the period from january 1, 2022 to december 31, 2022, which was achieved as of december 31, 2022. once this limit was achieved, we became responsible for all aduhelm related costs.
rest of world in october 2020 the ema accepted for review the maa for aducanumab and in december 2020 the ministry of health, labor and welfare (mhlw) accepted for review the japanese nda for aducanumab.
in december 2021 the chmp of the ema adopted a negative opinion on the maa for aducanumab in europe. we sought re-examination of the opinion by the chmp. in april 2022 we announced our decision to withdraw our maa for aducanumab in europe.
tecfidera multiple tecfidera generic entrants are now in north america, brazil and certain e.u. countries and have deeply discounted prices compared to tecfidera. the generic competition for tecfidera has significantly reduced our tecfidera revenue and we expect that tecfidera revenue will continue to decline in the future.
in the e.u., we are seeking to enforce a patent granted in june 2022 that relates to tecfidera and expires in 2028. in addition, we are litigating to affirm that tecfidera is entitled to regulatory data and table of contents market protection until at least february 2024. our company, the ema and the ec have each appealed the may 2021 decision of the european general court, which annulled the ema's decision not to validate an application for approval of a tecfidera generic on the basis that the ema and ec conducted the wrong assessment when determining tecfidera's entitlement to regulatory data and marketing protection. our company, the ema and the ec have each appealed the general court's decision as wrongly decided and the appeal is pending. on october 6, 2022, the advocate general of the cjeu issued a nonbinding advisory opinion in biogen's favor. this opinion recommends that the cjeu set aside the judgment of the european general court. we are awaiting the decision of the cjeu.

business update regarding covid-19 and other disruptions covid-19
the covid-19 pandemic continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world. the length of time and full extent to which the covid-19 pandemic directly or indirectly impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition, including sales, expense, reserves and allowances, the supply chain, manufacturing, clinical trials, research and development costs and employee-related costs, depends on future developments that are highly uncertain, subject to change and are difficult to predict, including as a result of new information that may emerge concerning covid-19 and the actions taken to contain or treat covid-19 as well as the economic impact on local, regional, national and international customers and markets.
we are monitoring the demand for our products, including the duration and degree to which we may see delays in starting new patients on a product due to hospitals diverting the resources that are necessary to administer certain of our products to care for covid-19 patients, including products, such as tysabri and spinraza, that are administered in a physician's office or hospital setting. we may also see reduced demand for immunosuppressant therapies during the covid-19 pandemic.
while we are currently continuing the clinical trials we have underway in sites across the globe, covid-19 precautions have impacted the timeline for some of our clinical trials and these precautions may, directly or indirectly, have a further impact on timing in the future.
geopolitical tensions the ongoing geopolitical tensions related to russia's invasion of ukraine have resulted in global business disruptions and economic volatility, including sanctions and other restrictions levied on the government and businesses in russia. although we do not have affiliates or employees, in either russia or ukraine, we do provide various therapies to patients in russia through a distributor and are currently involved in clinical trials with sites in ukraine and russia. the timing and costs of these trials may be impacted as a result of the conflict. in addition, new government sanctions on the export of certain manufacturing materials to russia may delay or limit our ability to get new products approved.
the impact of the conflict on our operations and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the severity and duration of the conflict, its impact on regional and global economic conditions and whether the conflict spreads or has effects on countries outside ukraine and russia. revenue generated from sales in these regions represented less than 2.0% of total product revenue for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021.
we will continue to monitor the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine and assess any potential impacts on our business, supply chain, partners or customers, as well as any factors that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
factors such as the covid-19 pandemic and other global health outbreaks, adverse weather events, geopolitical events, labor or raw material shortages and other supply chain disruptions could result in product shortages or other difficulties and delays or increased costs in manufacturing our products.
for additional information on the various risks posed by the covid-19 pandemic and the conflict in ukraine, please read item 1a. risk factors, included in this report.
table of contents inflation reduction act of 2022
in august 2022 the ira was signed into law in the u.s. the ira introduced new tax provisions, including a 15.0% corporate alternative minimum tax and a 1.0% excise tax on stock repurchases. the provisions of the ira will be effective for periods after december 31, 2022. the enactment of the ira did not result in any material adjustments to our income tax provision or net deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2022. we expect additional guidance and regulations to be issued in future periods and will continue to assess its potential impact on our business and results of operations as further information becomes available.
the ira also contains substantial drug pricing reforms that may have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry in the u.s. this includes allowing cms to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source medicare drugs, as well as redesigning medicare part d to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, potentially resulting in higher contributions from plans and manufacturers. the ira also establishes drug inflationary rebate requirements to penalize manufacturers from raising the prices of medicare covered single-source drugs and biologics beyond the inflation-adjusted rate. further, to incentivize biosimilar development, the ira provides an 8.0% medicare part b add-on payment for qualifying biosimilar products for a five-year period.
the overall impact that the ira will have on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and the impact on the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is not yet known. we will continue to assess as further information becomes available.
financial highlights diluted earnings per share attributable to biogen inc. were $20.87 for 2022, representing an increase of 100.7% as compared to $10.40 in the same period in 2021.
as described below under results of operations, our net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to biogen inc. for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, reflects the following:
revenue
•total revenue was $10,173.4 million for 2022, representing an $808.3 million, or 7.4%, decrease compared to $10,981.7 million in 2021.
•product revenue, net totaled $7,987.8 million for 2022, representing an $859.1 million, or 9.7%, decrease compared to $8,846.9 million in 2021. this decrease was primarily due to a $666.5 million, or 10.9%, decrease in ms product revenue, a $111.6 million, or 5.9%, decrease in spinraza product revenue and an $80.0 million, or 9.6%, decrease in revenue from our biosimilar business.
◦the decrease in ms product revenue of $666.5 million, or 10.9%, from $6,096.7 million in 2021 to $5,430.2 million in 2022, was primarily due to a decrease in tecfidera demand as a result of multiple tecfidera generic entrants in north america, brazil and certain e.u. countries, and a decrease in interferon demand due to competition as patients transition to higher efficacy and oral ms therapies.
◦the decrease in spinraza revenue of $111.6 million, or 5.9%, from $1,905.1 million in 2021 to $1,793.5 million in 2022, was primarily due to country mix, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange and the timing of shipments, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes. the increase in sales volumes reflects growth in certain asian markets, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes from increased competition in certain established markets, particularly germany and japan.
◦the decrease in revenue from our biosimilar business of $80.0 million, or 9.6%, from $831.1 million in 2021 to $751.1 million in 2022, was primarily due to unfavorable pricing and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes.
•revenue from anti-cd20 therapeutic programs totaled $1,700.5 million for 2022, representing a $42.0 million, or 2.5%, increase compared to $1,658.5 million in 2021. this increase was primarily due to a $144.6 million, or 14.6%, increase in royalty revenue on sales of ocrevus, partially offset by a $103.4 million, or 18.0%, decrease in rituxan revenue. sales of rituxan have been adversely affected by biosimilar competition.
•other revenue totaled $485.1 million for 2022, representing a $8.8 million, or 1.8%, increase from $476.3 million in 2021.
expense
•total cost and expense was $6,581.6 million for 2022, representing a $2,654.9 million, or 28.7%, decrease compared to $9,236.5 million in 2021.

◦research and development expense decreased $270.1 million, or 10.8%, from $2,501.2 million in 2021 to $2,231.1 million in 2022, primarily due to higher upfront payments in 2021. in 2021 we recorded approximately $285.0 million of upfront payments related to our collaborations with innocare, ionis, bio-thera, genentech, capsigen inc., and ginkgo bioworks, as compared to $28.5 million in 2022. in addition, $39.1 million of estimated clinical trial closeout costs and manufacturing commitments associated with biib111 (timrepigene emparvovec) and biib112 (cotoretigene toliparvovec) were recorded in 2021.
◦amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets decreased $515.4 million, or 58.5%, from $881.3 million in 2021 to $365.9 million in 2022, primarily due to higher impairment charges recorded in 2021. in 2021 we recorded $629.3 million of impairment charges, as compared to $119.6 million in 2022.
◦the decrease in cost and expense was also due to a pre-tax gain of $503.7 million recognized in 2022 related to the sale of one of our buildings.
◦other (income) expense, net for 2022 reflected a pre-tax gain of $1.5 billion related to the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in samsung bioepis, partially offset by a pre-tax charge of $900.0 million, plus settlement fees and expenses, related to a litigation settlement agreement to resolve a qui tam litigation relating to conduct prior to 2015.
as described below under financial condition, liquidity and capital resources:
•we generated $1,384.3 million of net cash flow from operations for 2022.
•cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $5,598.5 million as of december 31, 2022.
•we repurchased and retired approximately 3.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $750.0 million during 2022 under our 2020 share repurchase program. approximately $2.1 billion remained available under our 2020 share repurchase program as of december 31, 2022.

fumarate fumarate revenue includes sales from tecfidera and vumerity. during the fourth quarter of 2021 vumerity was approved for the treatment of rrms in the e.u., switzerland and the u.k.
for 2022 compared to 2021, the 13.8% decrease in u.s. fumarate revenue was primarily due to a decrease in tecfidera demand as a result of multiple tecfidera generic entrants in the u.s. market, partially offset by net price increases in tecfidera driven by lower pharmacy rebates, managed care rebates and co-pay assistance as well as an increase in vumerity sales volumes.
for 2022 compared to 2021, the 16.9% decrease in rest of world fumarate revenue was primarily due to tecfidera pricing reductions and a decrease in tecfidera demand as multiple tecfidera generic entrants entered into markets such as germany and canada. the decrease was also driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange, partially offset by an increase in vumerity sales volumes.
in the e.u., we are seeking to enforce a patent granted in june 2022 that relates to tecfidera and expires in 2028. in addition, we are litigating to affirm that tecfidera is entitled to regulatory data and market protection until at least february 2024. our company, the ema and the ec have each appealed the may 2021 decision of the european general court, which annulled the ema's decision not to validate an application for approval of a tecfidera generic on the basis that the ema and ec conducted the wrong assessment when determining tecfidera's entitlement to regulatory data and marketing protection. our company, the ema and the ec have each appealed the general court's decision as wrongly decided and the appeal is pending. on october 6, 2022, the advocate general of the cjeu issued a nonbinding advisory opinion in biogen's favor. this opinion recommends that the cjeu set aside the judgment of the european general court. we are awaiting the decision of the cjeu.
for additional information, please read note 21, litigation, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
we expect that tecfidera revenue will continue to decline in 2023, compared to 2022, as a result of generic competition in the north america, latin america and certain e.u. countries.
we expect an increase in vumerity sales volumes in 2023, compared to 2022, mostly due to demand growth in the u.s. and select european markets. we believe that we have resolved previously reported manufacturing issues at our contract manufacturer. in addition, we are in the process of securing regulatory approval for a secondary source of supply. we do not anticipate a supply shortage in 2023 and are currently focused on rebuilding adequate inventory.
table of contents interferon for 2022 compared to 2021, the 18.9% decrease in u.s. interferon revenue was primarily due to a decrease in interferon sales volumes of 15.5%. the net decline in sales volumes reflects the continued decline of the interferon market as patients transition to higher efficacy and oral ms therapies.
for 2022 compared to 2021, the 12.9% decrease in rest of world interferon revenue was primarily due to a decrease in interferon sales volumes of 6.0% resulting from the continued decline of the interferon market as patients transition to higher efficacy and oral ms therapies, as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange.
we expect that interferon revenue will continue to decline in both the u.s. and rest of world markets in 2023, compared to 2022, as a result of increasing competition from other ms products.
tysabri for 2022 compared to 2021, u.s. tysabri revenue was relatively flat, with a modest decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by an increase in pricing, net of higher discounts and allowances.
for 2022 compared to 2021, rest of world tysabri revenue was relatively flat, with a modest decrease in pricing and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes.
we anticipate tysabri revenue to be relatively flat on a global basis in 2023, compared to 2022, despite increasing competition from additional treatments for ms. we expect to continue to face price reductions in certain european markets. we are also aware of a potential biosimilar entrant of tysabri that may enter the u.s. and european markets as early as 2023.
table of contents spinal muscular atrophy spinraza for 2022 compared to 2021, u.s. spinraza revenue was relatively flat, with a modest increase in sales volumes of 3.7%, resulting from the timing of shipments, partially offset by higher discounts and allowances.
for 2022 compared to 2021, the 9.4% decrease in rest of world spinraza revenue was primarily due to country mix, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange and the timing of shipments, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes. the increase in sales volumes reflects growth in certain asian markets, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes from increased competition in certain established markets, particularly germany and japan.
despite competition from a gene therapy product and an oral product, we anticipate spinraza revenue to be relatively flat in 2023, compared to 2022. moderate growth in the u.s. as well as continued access expansion in emerging markets is expected to offset increased competition and the impact of loading dose dynamics.

biosimilars benepali, imraldi, flixabi and byooviz during the third quarter of 2021 byooviz, a ranibizumab biosimilar referencing lucentis, was approved in the u.s., the e.u and the u.k. byooviz launched in the u.s. in june 2022 and became commercially available in july 2022 through major distributors in the u.s.
for 2022 compared to 2021, the 9.6% decrease in biosimilar revenue was primarily due to unfavorable pricing and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes.
we anticipate modest growth in revenue from our biosimilars business in 2023, compared to 2022, driven by the continued launch of byooviz in the u.s. and rest of world, offset in part by continued price reductions in certain markets.
we are currently working with our contract manufacturer for imraldi to address facility regulatory inspection deficiencies at two filling locations, which could impact supply and have an adverse impact on 2023 imraldi sales, if not resolved. manufacturing of benepali also utilizes one of these facilities and therefore could have an adverse impact on 2023 benepali sales. we are working with our existing secondary supplier for benepali with the aim to secure additional capacity.

for 2022 compared to 2021, the decrease in u.s. product revenue, net was primarily due to a decrease in sales volumes of rituxan in the u.s. of
28.4%, primarily due to the onset of competition from multiple biosimilar products.
for 2022 compared to 2021, the decrease in collaboration costs and expense was primarily due to lower cost of sales, selling and marketing expense, distribution costs and other costs and expense related to rituxan.
we are aware of several other anti-cd20 molecules, including biosimilar products, that have been approved and are competing with rituxan and gazyva in the oncology and other markets. biosimilar products referencing rituxan have launched in the u.s and are being offered at lower prices. this competition has had a significant adverse impact on the pre-tax profits of our collaboration arrangements with genentech, as the sales of rituxan have decreased substantially compared to prior periods. we expect that biosimilar competition will continue to increase as these products capture additional market share and that this will have a significant adverse impact on our co-promotion profits in the u.s. in future years.
royalty revenue on sales of ocrevus for 2022 compared to 2021, the increase in royalty revenue on sales of ocrevus was primarily due to sales growth of ocrevus in the u.s.
ocrevus royalty revenue is based on our estimates from third party and market research data of ocrevus sales occurring during the corresponding period. differences between actual and estimated royalty revenue will be adjusted for in the period in which they become known, which is generally expected to be the following quarter.
other revenue from anti-cd20 therapeutic programs other revenue from anti-cd20 therapeutic programs consists of our share of pre-tax co-promotion profits from rituxan in canada.
in december 2022 the fda approved lunsumio, a bispecific antibody for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. our share of pre-tax profits and losses on lunsumio will be included as a component of revenue from anti-cd20 therapeutic programs in our consolidated statements of income. for the year ended december 31, 2022, lunsumio revenue was immaterial.
for additional information on our collaboration arrangements with genentech, including information regarding the pre-tax profit-sharing formula and its impact on future revenue from anti-cd20 therapeutic programs, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
table of contents other revenue other revenue consists of royalty revenue and contract manufacturing and other revenue and is summarized as follows:
royalty revenue and contract manufacturing and other revenue contract manufacturing and other revenue we record contract manufacturing and other revenue primarily from amounts earned under contract manufacturing agreements.
for 2022 compared to 2021, the decrease in contract manufacturing and other revenue was primarily due to lower contract manufacturing revenue related to the timing of batch releases.
royalty revenue we receive royalties from net sales on products related to patents that we have out-licensed, as well as royalty revenue on biosimilar products from our collaboration arrangements with samsung bioepis.
for additional information on our collaborative arrangements with samsung bioepis, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
reserves for discounts and allowances revenue from product sales is recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances, including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain international markets where we operate.
these reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). these estimates reflect our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. if actual results vary, we adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.
reserves for discounts, contractual adjustments and returns that reduced gross product revenue are summarized as follows:
table of contents for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, reserves for discounts and allowances as a percentage of gross product revenue were 30.1%, 28.6% and 27.1%, respectively.
discounts discounts include trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives.
for 2022 compared to 2021, the decrease in discounts was primarily due to a decrease in gross sales, driven by lower tecfidera sales, offset by higher purchase discounts for tysabri.
contractual adjustments contractual adjustments primarily relate to medicaid and managed care rebates in the u.s., pharmacy rebates, co-payment (copay) assistance, veterans administration, 340b discounts, specialty pharmacy program fees and other government rebates or applicable allowances.
for 2022 compared to 2021, the decrease in contractual adjustments was primarily driven by lower tecfidera sales in the u.s., resulting in lower pharmacy rebates, medicaid rebates and managed care rebates, as well as lower medicaid rebates in the u.s. driven by a favorable change in estimates for vumerity.
returns product return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers. in accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product. the majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. provisions for product returns are recognized in the period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales.
for 2022 compared to 2021, return reserves were relatively consistent.

product cost of sales for 2022 compared to 2021, the increase in product cost of sales was primarily due to higher charges in 2022 associated with the write-off of excess aduhelm inventory and purchase commitments, higher gross idle capacity charges associated with our manufacturing facilities and increased product cost of sales driven by product mix.
inventory amounts written down as a result of excess, obsolescence or unmarketability totaled $336.2 million, $167.6 million and $26.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded approximately $286.0 million and $170.0 million, respectively, of charges associated with the write-off of aduhelm inventory and purchase commitments in excess of forecasted demand.
for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded approximately $119.0 million and $48.0 million, respectively, of aggregate gross idle capacity charges.
we have also recognized approximately $197.0 million and $99.0 million related to eisai's 45.0% share of inventory, idle capacity charges and contractual commitments, which was recorded in collaboration profit (loss) sharing within our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
for additional information on our collaboration arrangements with eisai, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
royalty cost of sales for 2022 compared to 2021, the decrease in royalty cost of sales was primarily due to lower royalties payable on lower sales of spinraza, tysabri and avonex, partially offset by higher royalties payable on higher sales of vumerity.
research and development table of contents we support our drug discovery and development efforts through the commitment of significant resources to discovery, research and development programs and business development opportunities.
a significant amount of our research and development costs consist of indirect costs incurred in support of overall research and development activities and non-specific programs, including activities that benefit multiple programs, such as management costs, as well as depreciation, information technology and facility-based expenses. these costs are considered other research and development costs in the table above and are not allocated to a specific program or stage.
research and development expense incurred in support of our marketed products includes costs associated with product lifecycle management activities including, if applicable, costs associated with the development of new indications for existing products. late stage programs are programs in phase 3 development or in registration stage. early stage programs are programs in phase 1 or phase 2 development. research and discovery represents costs incurred to support our discovery research and translational science efforts. costs are reflected in the development stage based upon the program status when incurred. therefore, the same program could be reflected in different development stages in the same year. for several of our programs, the research and development activities are part of our collaborative and other relationships. our costs reflect our share of the total costs incurred.
for 2022 compared to 2021, the decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to higher milestone payments in 2021, partially offset by the advancement of biib059 (anti-bdca2) for the potential treatment of sle and cle, the development of lunsumio, a a bispecific antibody for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma, the development of biib124 (sage-324) for the potential treatment of essential tremor, which we are developing in collaboration with sage, the development of biib122 (dnl151) for the potential treatment of parkinson's disease, which we are developing in collaboration with denali, and the development of biib800, a proposed tocilizumab biosimilar referencing actemra.
excluding upfront payments, we expect our core research and development expense to modestly increase in 2023, as we continue to invest in our pipeline. we intend to continue committing significant resources to targeted research and development opportunities where there is a significant unmet need and where a drug candidate has the potential to be highly differentiated.
milestone and upfront expense research and development expense for 2022 includes:
•$37.0 million in charges to research and development expense in connection with milestone payments to ionis;
•$15.0 million charge to research and development expense in connection with the upfront payment associated with entering into our collaboration with alectos in the second quarter of 2022; and
•$10.0 million charge to research and development expense in connection with the upfront payment associated with entering into table of contents our collaboration with alcyone in the fourth quarter of 2022.
research and development expense for 2021 includes:
•$125.0 million charge to research and development expense in connection with the upfront payment associated with entering into our collaboration with innocare in the third quarter of 2021;
•$60.0 million charge to research and development expense upon the exercise of our option under our collaboration agreement with ionis to develop and commercialize biib115, an investigational aso in development for sma;
•$30.0 million charge to research and development expense related to the option exercise fee payable to genentech to jointly develop and commercialize lunsumio; and
•$30.0 million charge to research and development expense in connection with the upfront payment associated with entering into a commercialization and license agreement with bio-thera to develop, manufacture and commercialize biib800.
the upfront payments associated with these collaborations are classified as research and development expense as the programs they relate to had not achieved regulatory approval as of the payment date.
for additional information about these collaboration arrangements, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
early stage programs for 2022 compared to 2021, the decrease in spending related to our early stage programs was primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with:
•the discontinuation of cinpanemab (biib054) in parkinson's disease;
•the discontinuation of gosuranemab (biib092) in alzheimer's disease;
•the discontinuation of cotoretigene toliparvovec (biib112) in x-linked retinitis pigmentosa;
•the advancement of litifilimab (biib059) for the potential treatment of sle into late stage;
•the advancement of biib122 for the potential treatment of parkinson's disease into late stage;
•the discontinuation of vixotrigine (biib074) in tgn and dpn; and
•the discontinuation of biib078 for the potential treatment of alzheimer's disease.
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with:
•an increase in spending in the development of biib124 for the potential treatment of essential tremor;
•an increase in spending in the development of litifilimab (biib059) for the potential treatment of cle;
•an increase in spending in the development of biib113 for the potential treatment of alzheimer's disease;
•an increase in spending in the development of biib131 for the potential treatment of acute ischemic stroke; and
•an increase in spending in the development of biib121 for the potential treatment of angelman syndrome.
late stage programs for 2022 compared to 2021, the decrease in spending associated with our late stage programs was primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with:
•the advancement of aduhelm from late stage to marketed upon the accelerated approval of aduhelm in the u.s.; and
•the discontinuation of biib111 in choroideremia.
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with:
•the advancement of litifilimab (biib059) for the potential treatment of sle into late stage;
•the advancement of biib122 for the potential treatment of parkinson's disease into late stage; and
•the advancement of biib800, a proposed tocilizumab biosimilar referencing actemra, into late stage.
marketed programs for 2022 compared to 2021, the increase in spending associated with our marketed programs was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with:
•the advancement of aduhelm from late stage to marketed upon the accelerated approval of aduhelm in the u.s.; and
•the advancement of lunsumio from late stage to marketed upon the accelerated approval of lunsumio in the u.s.
table of contents other research and development in march 2019 eisai initiated a global phase 3 trial for the development of leqembi in early alzheimer's disease. under our collaboration arrangement, eisai serves as the lead of leqembi development and regulatory submissions globally with both companies co-commercializing and co-promoting the product, and eisai having final decision-making authority. all costs, including research, development, sales and marketing expense, are shared equally between us and eisai. in january 2023 the fda granted accelerated approval of leqembi. additionally, in january 2023 eisai completed the submission of a supplemental bla to the fda for approval under the traditional pathway for leqembi.
as of december 31, 2022, we had approximately $89.8 million of work-in-process inventory related to leqembi.
for additional information on our collaboration arrangements with eisai, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
selling, general and administrative for 2022 compared to 2021, the decrease in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to cost-reduction measures realized during 2022.
as a result of the final ncd we have substantially eliminated our commercial infrastructure supporting aduhelm, retaining minimal resources to manage patient access programs, including a continued free drug program for patients currently on treatment in the u.s.
beginning in the second quarter of 2021 reimbursement from eisai for its share of u.s.
aduhelm selling, general and administrative expense is recognized in collaboration profit (loss) sharing in our consolidated statements of income.
we expect selling, general and administrative costs to continue to decline in 2023 due to the implementation of our cost saving initiatives during 2022, which include the substantial elimination of our commercial infrastructure supporting aduhelm as well as other cost-reduction measures.
amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets our amortization expense is based on the economic consumption and impairment of intangible assets. our most significant amortizable intangible assets are related to our tysabri, avonex, spinraza, vumerity and tecfidera (rest of world) products and other programs acquired through business combinations.
for 2022 compared to 2021, the decrease in amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets was primarily due to higher impairment charges in 2021 of approximately $629.3 million, compared to impairment charges of approximately $119.6 million in 2022.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects the impact of a $119.6 million impairment charge related to vixotrigine for the potential treatment of dpn.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects the impact of a $365.0 million impairment charge related to biib111, a $220.0 million impairment charge related to biib112 and a $44.3 million impairment charge related to vixotrigine for the potential treatment of tgn.
table of contents amortization of acquired intangible assets, excluding impairment charges, totaled $246.3 million, $252.0 million and $255.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
we monitor events and expectations regarding product performance. if new information indicates that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis are substantially different than those utilized in our current estimates, our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue of the relevant products. the occurrence of an adverse event could substantially increase the amount of amortization expense related to our acquired intangible assets as compared to previous periods or our current expectations, which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations.
ipr&d related to business combinations ipr&d represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that we acquired as part of a business combination and had not yet reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition. we review amounts capitalized as acquired ipr&d for impairment annually, as of october 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate to us that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable.
overall, the value of our acquired ipr&d assets is dependent upon several variables, including estimates of future revenue and the effects of competition, our ability to secure sufficient pricing in a competitive market, our ability to confirm safety and efficacy based on data from clinical trials and regulatory feedback, the level of anticipated development costs and the probability and timing of successfully advancing a particular research program from one clinical trial phase to the next. we are continually reevaluating our estimates concerning these and other variables, including our life cycle management strategies, research and development priorities and development risk, changes in program and portfolio economics and related impact of foreign currency exchange rates and economic trends and evaluating industry and company data regarding the productivity of clinical research and the development process. changes in our estimates may result in a significant change to our valuation of our ipr&d assets.
vixotrigine in the periods following our acquisition of vixotrigine, there were numerous delays in the initiation of phase 3 studies for the potential treatment of tgn and for the potential treatment of dpn, another form of neuropathic pain. we engaged with the fda regarding the design of the potential phase 3 studies of vixotrigine for the potential treatment of tgn and dpn and performed an additional clinical trial of vixotrigine, which was completed during 2022.
the performance of this additional clinical trial delayed the initiation of the phase 3 studies of vixotrigine for the potential treatment of tgn, and, as a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $44.3 million related to vixotrigine for the potential treatment of tgn during the first quarter of 2021.
during the fourth quarter of 2022 we discontinued further development of vixotrigine based on regulatory, development and commercialization challenges. for the year ended december 31, 2022, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $119.6 million related to vixotrigine for the potential treatment of dpn, reducing the remaining book value of this ipr&d intangible asset to zero. we also adjusted the value of our contingent consideration obligations related to this asset resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $209.1 million, which was recognized in (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration within our consolidated statements of income.
biib111 and biib112
during the second quarter of 2021 we announced that our phase 3 star study of biib111 and our phase 2/3 xirius study of biib112 did not meet their primary endpoints. in the third quarter of 2021 we suspended further development on these programs based on the decision by management as part of its strategic review process. for the year ended december 31, 2021, we recognized an impairment charge of $365.0 million related to biib111 and an impairment charge of $220.0 million related to biib112, reducing the remaining book values of these ipr&d intangible assets to zero.
in addition, as a result of our decision to suspend further development of biib111 and biib112, we recorded charges of approximately $39.1 million during the third quarter of 2021 related to our manufacturing arrangements and other costs that we expect to incur as a result of suspending these programs. these charges were recognized in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2021.

collaboration profit (loss) sharing collaboration profit (loss) sharing primarily includes samsung bioepis' 50.0% share of the profit or loss related to our biosimilars 2013 commercial agreement with samsung bioepis and, beginning in the second quarter of 2021, eisai's 45.0% share of income and expense in the u.s. related to the aduhelm collaboration agreement. beginning january 1, 2023, eisai receives only a tiered royalty based on net sales of aduhelm, and will no longer share global profits and losses.
for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized net profit-sharing expense of $217.4 million and $285.4 million, respectively, to reflect samsung bioepis' 50.0% sharing of the net collaboration profits.
for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 we recognized net reductions to our operating expense of approximately $224.7 million and $233.2 million, respectively, to reflect eisai's 45.0% share of net collaboration losses in the u.s.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, we also recognized net reductions to our operating expense of $45.0 million to reflect eisai's 45.0% share of the $100.0 million milestone payment made to neurimmune related to the launch of aduhelm in the u.s. during the second quarter of 2021.
for additional information on our collaboration arrangements with samsung bioepis and eisai, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
(gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration for the year ended december 31, 2022,  the changes in fair value of our contingent consideration obligations were primarily due to the discontinuation of further development efforts related to vixotrigine for the potential treatment of tgn and dpn, resulting in a reduction of our contingent consideration obligations of approximately $195.4 million, and changes in the interest rates used to revalue our contingent consideration liabilities.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, the changes in fair value of our contingent consideration obligations were primarily due to reductions in the probability of technical and regulatory success and delays in the expected timing of the achievement of certain remaining developmental milestones related to our vixotrigine programs.

table of contents restructuring charges
2022 cost saving initiatives in december 2021 and may 2022 we announced our plans to implement a series of cost-reduction measures that when completed we expect may yield approximately $1.0 billion in expense savings. these savings are being achieved through a number of initiatives, including reductions to our workforce, the substantial elimination of our commercial aduhelm infrastructure, the consolidation of certain real estate locations and operating efficiency gains across our selling, general and administrative and research and development functions.
under these initiatives, we estimate we will incur total restructuring charges of approximately $131.0 million, primarily related to severance. these amounts were substantially incurred during 2022. as of december 31, 2022, approximately $35.9 million remained in our restructuring reserve and payments are expected to be made through 2026.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, we recognized approximately $131.1 million of net pre-tax restructuring charges related to our 2022 cost saving initiatives, of which approximately $112.6 million consisted of employee severance costs. our restructuring reserve is included in accrued expense and other in our consolidated balance sheets.
in september 2022 we entered into an agreement to partially terminate a portion of our lease located at 300 binney street, as well as to reduce the lease term for the majority of the remaining space. this resulted in a gain of approximately $5.3 million, which was recorded within restructuring charges in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2022. for additional information on our 300 binney street lease modification, please read note 12, leases, to these consolidated financial statements included in this report.
following an evaluation of our current capacity needs, in march 2022 we ceased using a patient services office space in durham, nc. our decision to cease use of the facility resulted in the immediate expense of certain leasehold improvements and other assets at this facility. as a result, we recognized approximately $10.4 million of accelerated depreciation expense, which was recorded in restructuring charges in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2022. in may 2022 we entered into a lease assignment agreement whereby we assigned our remaining lease obligations to an external third party. as a result of the lease assignment, we derecognized the related operating lease obligation and right-of-use asset during the second quarter of 2022.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, we recognized other restructuring costs of approximately $13.2 million, which were recorded in restructuring charges in our consolidated statements of income. other restructuring costs include items such as facility closure costs, employee non-severance expense, asset write-offs and other costs.
the following table summarizes the charges and spending related to our 2022 workforce reductions for the year ended december 31, 2022:

table of contents gain on sale of building in september 2022 we completed the sale of our building and land parcel located at 125 broadway for an aggregate sales price of approximately $603.0 million, which is inclusive of a $10.8 million tenant allowance. this sale resulted in a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately $503.7 million, net of transaction costs, for the year ended december 31, 2022.
simultaneously, with the close of this transaction we leased back the building for a term of approximately 5.5 years, which resulted in the recognition of approximately $168.2 million in new lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recorded within our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2022. the sale and immediate leaseback of this building qualified for sale and leaseback treatment and is classified as an operating lease.
for additional information on our 125 broadway sale and leaseback transaction, please read note 11, property, plant and equipment and note 12, leases, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
other (income) expense, net for 2022 compared to 2021, the change in other (income) expense, net primarily reflects a pre-tax gain during 2022 of approximately $1.5 billion related to the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in samsung bioepis, partially offset by a pre-tax charge of $900.0 million, plus settlement fees and expenses, related to a litigation settlement agreement to resolve a qui tam litigation relating to conduct prior to 2015.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, net unrealized losses and realized (gains) losses on our holdings in equity securities were approximately $264.7 million and zero, respectively, compared to net unrealized losses and realized gains of $831.4 million and $10.3 million, respectively, in 2021.
the net unrealized losses recognized during the year ended december 31, 2022, primarily reflect a decrease in the aggregate fair value of our investments in denali and sangamo common stock of approximately $278.0 million.
the net unrealized losses recognized during the year ended december 31, 2021, primarily reflect decreases in the aggregate fair value of our investments in denali, sage, sangamo and ionis common stock of approximately $819.6 million.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, net interest expense was $157.3 million, compared to $242.6 million in 2021. this decrease was primarily due to higher interest income earned on our investments in 2022, compared to 2021, and lower interest expense in 2022 due to the redemption of our 3.625% senior notes due september 15, 2022, with an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion.
for 2023 compared to 2022, we anticipate a decrease in net interest expense as a result of lower average debt balances in 2023 and an increase in table of contents interest income driven by higher interest rates on our cash and marketable securities.

income tax provision our effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the global nature of our operations. the factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include changes in tax laws, variability in the allocation of our taxable earnings among multiple jurisdictions, the amount and characterization of our research and development expense, the levels of certain deductions and credits, acquisitions and licensing transactions.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to 2021, the increase in our effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the net neurimmune deferred tax asset, as discussed below, includes the tax impacts of the litigation settlement agreement and the sale of our building at 125 broadway. these increases were partially offset by the impact of the current year tax benefits related to an international reorganization to align with global tax developments, the impacts of the sale of our equity interest in samsung bioepis and the tax impacts of the decision to discontinue development of vixotrigine. further in 2021, our effective tax rate benefited from the tax effects of the biib111 and biib112 impairment charges and the non-cash tax effects of changes in the value of our equity instruments.
for additional information on the litigation settlement agreement, please read note 18, other consolidated financial statement detail, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
neurimmune deferred tax asset during 2021 we recorded a net deferred tax asset in switzerland of approximately $100.0 million on neurimmune's tax basis in aduhelm, the realization of which was dependent on future sales of aduhelm.
during the first quarter of 2022, upon issuance of the final ncd related to aduhelm, we recorded an increase in a valuation allowance of approximately $85.0 million to reduce the net value of this deferred tax asset to zero.
these adjustments to our net deferred tax asset are each recorded with an equal and offsetting amount assigned to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of income, resulting in a zero net impact to net income attributable to biogen inc.

equity in (income) loss of investee, net of tax in february 2012 we entered into a joint venture agreement with samsung biologics establishing an entity, samsung bioepis, to develop, manufacture and market biosimilar products.
in april 2022 we completed the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in samsung bioepis to samsung biologics. following the sale of samsung bioepis we no longer recognize gains or losses associated with samsung bioepis' results of operations and amortization related to basis differences.
prior to this sale, we recognized our share of the results of operations related to our investment in samsung bioepis under the equity method of accounting one quarter in arrears when the results of the entity became available, which was reflected as equity in (income) loss of investee, net of tax in our consolidated statements of income. we also recognized amortization on certain basis differences resulting from our november 2018 investment.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, we recognized net income on our investment of $2.6 million, reflecting our share of samsung bioepis' operating profits, net of tax, totaling $17.0 million offset by amortization of basis differences totaling $14.4 million. this amount reflects our share of results prior to the sale of samsung bioepis as the results are recognized one quarter in arrears.

nm not meaningful overview we have historically financed and expect to continue to fund our operating and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow earned through our operations as well as our existing cash resources. we believe generic competition for tecfidera in the u.s. and other key markets and the impact of biosimilar competition on rituxan sales volumes will continue to reduce our cash flow from operations in 2023 and will have a significant adverse impact on our future cash flow from operations.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, certain significant cash flows were as follows:
•$1,384.3 million in net cash flow provided by operating activities;
•$990.3 million in net proceeds received from the sale of our equity interest in samsung bioepis;
•$582.6 million in net proceeds received from the sale of one of our buildings;
•$1.0 billion payment made for the redemption of our 3.625% senior notes due september 15, 2022;
•$917.0 million in total net payments for a litigation settlement agreement and settlement fees and expenses;
•$932.9 million in total net payments for income taxes;
•$750.0 million used for share repurchases; and
•$240.3 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, certain significant cash flows were as follows:
•$3,639.9 million in net cash flow provided by operating activities;
•$1.8 billion used for share repurchases;
•$170.0 million used in connection with our private offer to exchange (exchange offer) our tendered 5.200% senior notes due september 15, 2045 (2045 senior notes) for a new series of 3.250% senior notes due february 15, 2051 (2051 senior notes) and cash, and an offer to purchase our tendered 2045 senior notes for cash;
•$258.1 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment;
•$247.9 million in total net payments for income taxes; and
•$100.0 million milestone payment to neurimmune.
we believe that our existing funds, when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to additional financing resources, if needed, are sufficient to satisfy our operating, working capital, strategic alliance, milestone payment, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. in addition, we may choose to opportunistically return cash to shareholders and pursue other business initiatives, including acquisition and licensing activities. we may, from time to time, also seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other table of contents sources should we identify a significant new opportunity.

cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities until required for another use in our business, we typically invest our cash reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes, u.s. and foreign government instruments, overnight reverse repurchase agreements and other interest-bearing marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy. it is our policy to mitigate credit risk in our cash reserves and marketable securities by maintaining a well-diversified portfolio that limits the amount of exposure as to institution, maturity and investment type.
as of december 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately $5.6 billion compared to approximately $4.7 billion as of december 31, 2021. the change in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at december 31, 2022, from december 31, 2021, was primarily due to net cash flow provided by operating activities, which includes $917.0 million in total net payments for a litigation settlement agreement and settlement fees and expenses, and $990.3 million in net proceeds received from the sale of our equity interest in samsung bioepis and $582.6 million in net proceeds received from the sale of one of our buildings, partially offset by $1.0 billion of cash used for the redemption of our 3.625% senior notes due september 15, 2022 and $750.0 million used for share repurchases.

although the contractual holding period restrictions on our investments in denali, sage, sangamo and ionis have expired, our ability to liquidate these investments may be limited by the size of our interest, the volume of market related activity, our concentrated level of ownership and potential restrictions resulting from our status as a collaborator. therefore, we may realize significantly less than the current value of such investments.
for additional information on our collaboration arrangements, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
investments and other assets investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2021, includes the carrying value of our investment in samsung bioepis of $599.9 million. in april 2022 we completed the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in samsung bioepis to samsung biologics. under the terms of this transaction, we received approximately $1.0 billion in cash at closing and expect to receive approximately $1.3 billion in cash to be deferred over two payments of approximately $812.5 million due at the first anniversary and approximately $437.5 million due at the second anniversary of the closing of this transaction.
as part of this transaction, we are also eligible to receive up to an additional $50.0 million upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones. if any payments due to us remain outstanding after the second anniversary of the closing of this transaction, we may elect to receive shares of samsung biologics common stock at a 5.0% discount in lieu of a cash payment for the remaining amount due. currently, we believe that the likelihood of samsung biologics failing to make timely payments to us for the amounts due is remote.
for additional information on the sale of our equity interest in samsung bioepis, please read note 3, dispositions, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
capital expenditures in march 2021 we announced our plans to build a new gene therapy manufacturing facility in rtp, nc to support our gene therapy pipeline across multiple therapeutic areas. the new manufacturing facility will be approximately 197,000 square feet and is expected to be operational by the end of 2023, with an estimated total investment of approximately $195.0 million. construction for this new facility began during the fourth quarter of 2021.

credit facility in january 2020 we entered into a $1.0 billion, five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we are permitted to draw funds for working capital and general corporate purposes. the terms of the revolving credit facility include a financial covenant that requires us not to exceed a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.
as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings and were in compliance with all covenants under this facility.
working capital working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. working capital was $6.5 billion and $3.6 billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the change in working capital reflects an increase in total current assets of approximately $1.9 billion and a decrease in total current liabilities of approximately $1.0 billion.
current assets the increase in total current assets was primarily driven by the following:
•net increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities due to net cash flow provided by operating activities of approximately $1,384.3 million;
•receipt of approximately $990.3 million in cash, net of expenses, from the sale of our equity interest in samsung bioepis;
•recording of a receivable from samsung biologics for approximately $798.8 million as part of the sale of our equity interest in samsung bioepis; and
•cash receipt of approximately $582.6 million related to the sale of one of our buildings.
the increase was partially offset by cash used for the redemption of our 3.625% senior notes due september 15, 2022, of approximately $1.0 billion and share repurchases of $750.0 million and $917.0 million in total net payments for a litigation settlement agreement and settlement fees and expenses.
current liabilities the decrease in total current liabilities was primarily due to the following:
•redemption of our 3.625% senior notes due september 15, 2022, of approximately $1.0 billion, which were classified within current liabilities in 2021; and
•a reduction in our accounts payable.
share repurchase programs in october 2020 our board of directors authorized our 2020 share repurchase program, which is a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock. our 2020 share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. all share repurchases under our 2020 share repurchase table of contents program will be retired. under our 2020 share repurchase program, we repurchased and retired approximately 3.6 million, 6.0 million and 1.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $750.0 million, $1.8 billion and $400.0 million during the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. approximately $2.1 billion remained available under our 2020 share repurchase program as of december 31, 2022.
in december 2019 our board of directors authorized our december 2019 share repurchase program, which was a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock, which was completed as of september 30, 2020. all shares repurchased under our december 2019 share repurchase program were retired. under our december 2019 share repurchase program, we repurchased and retired approximately 16.7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $5.0 billion during the year ended december 31, 2020.
in march 2019 our board of directors authorized our march 2019 share repurchase program, which was a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock, which was completed as of march 31, 2020. all shares repurchased under our march 2019 share repurchase program were retired. under our march 2019 share repurchase program, we repurchased and retired approximately 4.1 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $1.3 billion during the year ended december 31, 2020.
in august 2022 the ira was signed into law. among other things, the ira levies a 1.0% excise tax on net stock repurchases after december 31, 2022. historically, we have made discretionary share repurchases.

operating activities cash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. we expect cash provided from operating activities will continue to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.
operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for:
•non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, unrealized gain (loss) on strategic investments, acquired ipr&d and share-based compensation;
•changes in operating assets and liabilities, which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations; and
•changes in the fair value of contingent payments associated with our acquisitions of businesses and payments related to collaborations.
for 2022 compared to 2021, the decrease in net cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower revenue in 2022, net payments of $917.0 million for a litigation settlement agreement and settlement fees and expenses, timing of payments and higher net income tax payments in 2022. the higher tax payments are, in part, due to a change in the tax deductibility of payments made for research and development.
investing activities for 2022 compared to 2021, the increase in net cash flow provided by investing activities was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in samsung bioepis of $990.3 million, net of expenses, during the second quarter of 2022 as well as $582.6 million in net proceeds received from the sale of one of our buildings during the third quarter of 2022.
financing activities for 2022 compared to 2021, the decrease in net cash flow used in financing activities was primarily due to $1.1 billion in lower share repurchases in 2022, partially offset by $832.2 million in higher debt repayments in 2022.

for additional information on our collaboration arrangement with alkermes, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
contingent development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments based on our development plans as of december 31, 2022, we could trigger potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately $9.3 billion, including approximately $2.0 billion in development milestones, approximately $0.5 billion in regulatory milestones and approximately $6.8 billion in commercial milestones, as part of our various collaborations, including licensing and development programs. payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. because the achievement of these milestones was not considered probable as table of contents of december 31, 2022, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones.
if certain clinical and commercial milestones are met, we may pay up to $356.2 million in milestones in 2023 under our current agreements. this includes milestones totaling $225.0 million due to sage upon the first commercial sale of zuranolone, for the potential treatment of mdd and ppd, in the u.s.
other funding commitments as of december 31, 2022, we have several ongoing clinical studies in various clinical trial stages. our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to cros. the contracts with cros are generally cancellable, with notice, at our option. we recorded accrued expense of approximately $20.4 million in our consolidated balance sheets for expenditures incurred by cros as of december 31, 2022. we have approximately $929.0 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing cro contracts as of december 31, 2022.
tax related obligations we exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. as of december 31, 2022, we have approximately $154.6 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.
as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, we have accrued income tax liabilities of approximately $558.0 million and $633.0 million, respectively, under the transition toll tax. of the amounts accrued as of december 31, 2022, approximately $137.8 million is expected to be paid within one year. the transition toll tax will be paid in installments over an eight--year period, which started in 2018, and will not accrue interest.
other off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. as such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. we consolidate variable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary.

legal matters for a discussion of legal matters as of december 31, 2022, please read note 21, litigation, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (u.s. gaap), requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expense. actual results may differ from these estimates. other significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. we recognize revenue following the five-step model prescribed under financial accounting standards board (fasb) accounting standards codification 606, revenue from contracts with customers: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations.
product revenue in the u.s., we sell our products primarily to wholesale and specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies. in other countries, we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors, hospitals, pharmacies and other third-party distribution partners. these customers subsequently resell our products to table of contents health care providers and patients. in addition, we enter into arrangements with health care providers and payors that provide for government-mandated or privately-negotiated discounts and allowances related to our products.
product revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. we expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.
reserves for discounts and allowances product revenue is recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with our customers, health care providers or payors, including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain of the international markets in which we operate. our process for estimating reserves established for these variable consideration components do not differ materially from our historical practices.
product revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenue, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts, contractual adjustments and returns.
these reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). our estimates of reserves established for variable consideration are calculated based upon a consistent application of our methodology utilizing the expected value method. these estimates reflect our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. the transaction price, which includes variable consideration reflecting the impact of discounts and allowances, may be subject to constraint and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. if actual results vary, we adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.
as of december 31, 2022, a 10.0% change in our discounts, contractual adjustments and reserves would have resulted in a decrease of our pre-tax earnings by approximately $338.6 million.
in addition to discounts, rebates and product returns, we also maintain certain customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management, data and distribution services, which are generally reflected as a reduction of revenue. to the extent we can demonstrate a separable benefit and fair value for these services we classify these payments in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
for additional information on our revenue, please read note 5, revenue, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
inventory at each reporting period we review our inventories for excess or obsolescence and write-down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires management to make estimates based on assumptions about the future demand of our products, product expiration dates, estimated future sales and our general future plans. if customer demand subsequently differs from our forecasts, we may be required to record additional charges for excess inventory.
although we believe that the assumptions we use in estimating inventory write-downs are reasonable, no assurance can be given that significant future changes in these assumptions or changes in future events and market conditions could result in different estimates.
during 2021 we wrote-off approximately $120.0 million of inventory in excess of forecasted demand related to aduhelm. during the first quarter of 2022 we wrote-off approximately $275.0 million, as a result of the final cms decision.
as of december 31, 2022, the carrying value of our aduhelm inventory was immaterial. as of december 31, 2021, we had approximately $223.0 million of aduhelm inventory.
acquired intangible assets, including ipr&d when we purchase a business, the acquired ipr&d is measured at fair value, capitalized as an intangible asset and tested for impairment at least annually, as of october 31, until commercialization, after which time the ipr&d is amortized over its estimated useful life. if we acquire an asset or group of assets that do not meet the definition of a business under applicable accounting standards, the acquired ipr&d is expensed on its acquisition date. future costs to develop these assets are recorded to table of contents research and development expense as they are incurred.
we have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible assets through the acquisition of biotechnology companies or through the consolidation of variable interest entities. these intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and ipr&d product candidates. when significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, we generally engage an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets acquired. discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:
•estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in-process projects;
•projecting regulatory approvals;
•estimating future cash flow from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects; and
•developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project.
we believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates.
if these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods. additionally, the value of the acquired intangible assets may become impaired. no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated.
impairment and amortization of long-lived assets long-lived assets to be held and used include property, plant and equipment as well as intangible assets, including ipr&d and trademarks. property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. we review our intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, as of october 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
when performing our impairment assessment, we calculate the fair value using the same methodology as described above under acquired intangible assets, including ipr&d. if the carrying value of our acquired ipr&d exceeds its fair value, then the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. changes in estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our acquired ipr&d could result in an impairment. impairments are recorded within amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets in our consolidated statements of income.
based on our most recent impairment assessment we incurred impairment charges of approximately $119.6 million and $629.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, mainly related to the discontinuation of ipr&d programs. for additional information on our impairments, note 7, intangible assets and goodwill, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
our most significant intangible assets are our acquired and in-licensed rights and patents. acquired and in-licensed rights and patents primarily relate to our acquisition of all remaining rights to tysabri. we amortize the intangible assets related to our marketed products using the economic consumption method based on revenue generated from the products underlying the related intangible assets. an analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenue of our marketed products is performed annually during our long-range planning cycle and whenever events or changes in circumstances would significantly affect anticipated lifetime revenue of the relevant products.
for additional information on the impairment charges related to our long-lived assets during 2022, 2021 and 2020, please read note 7, intangible assets and goodwill, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
contingent consideration we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. each reporting period thereafter, we revalue the remaining obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to contingent consideration expense in our consolidated statements of income. changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates and achievement and timing of any cumulative sales-based and development milestones or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval. these fair value measurements represent level 3 measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market.
table of contents significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. accordingly, changes in assumptions described above, could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.
income taxes we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction's tax laws and regulations. in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. upon our election in the fourth quarter of 2018 to record deferred taxes for global intangible low-taxed income (gilti), we have included amounts related to gilti taxes within temporary difference.
significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. in performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. in making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and the effects of tax planning strategies. in the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
we account for uncertain tax positions using a "more likely than not" threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished, through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the "more likely than not" threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process. we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews, we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re-examine the related tax position. we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

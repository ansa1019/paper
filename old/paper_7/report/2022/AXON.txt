overview axon's product suite includes taser energy devices, body-worn cameras, in-car cameras, cloud-hosted digital evidence management solutions, productivity software and real-time operations capabilities. our financial strategy is to build highly recurring, highly profitable businesses. axon products are generally cloud-connected, designed to drive better outcomes and customer experiences, and sold via mutually reinforcing integrated bundles.
axon's operations comprise two reportable segments:
1.    software and sensors: we develop, manufacture and sell fully integrated hardware and cloud-based software solutions that enable law enforcement to capture, securely store, manage, share and analyze video and other digital evidence. our software offerings also support productivity and real-time operations.

2.    taser: axon is the market leader in the development, manufacture and sale of ceds, which we sell under our brand name, taser.

we derive revenue from two primary sources: (1) the sale of physical products, including axon cameras, axon signal enabled devices, ceds, corresponding hardware extended warranties, and related accessories such as axon docks, cartridges and batteries, among others, and (2) subscriptions to our axon evidence digital evidence management software-as-a-service ("saas") (including data storage fees and other ancillary services), which includes varying levels of support. to a lesser extent, we also recognize revenue from training, professional services and other software and saas services.
some of our products and services are sold on a standalone basis. we also bundle our hardware products and services together and sell them to our customers in single transactions, where the customer can make payments over a multi-year period. these sales may include payments for upfront hardware and services, as well as payments for hardware and services to be provided by us at a future date.
our revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022 were $1,189.9 million, an increase of $326.6 million, or 37.8%, from the prior year. we had income from operations of $93.3 million compared to a loss from operations of $168.1 million in the prior year. gross margin dollars increased by $187.7 million, but decreased as a percentage of revenue compared to 2021, reflecting higher labor and freight costs. operating expenses decreased $73.6 million, reflecting a decrease of $195.9 million in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to the ceo performance award and xspp, partially offset by an increase in salaries and bonus expense, and increases in travel and commissions expense. for the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded net income of $147.1 million, which reflected net unrealized gains of $131.9 million related to observable price changes for our existing investments and related warrants and an unrealized loss of $32.9 million on market securities related to our investment in cellebrite di ltd ("clbt"), compared to a net loss of $60.0 million for the prior year.

international revenue increased in 2022, driven by strength in our asia-pacific ("apac") region, but decreased as a percentage of total revenue compared to 2021.
our operations are comprised of two reportable segments. in both segments, we report sales of products and services. service revenue in both segments includes sales related to axon evidence.
●   the "software and sensors" segment includes software and sensors, which includes the sale of devices, wearables, applications, cloud and mobile products, and services.

o   "axon cloud revenue" includes recurring cloud-hosted software revenue, related non-recurring professional services, and certain software, including on-premise licenses.

o   "sensors and other revenue" is referred to as revenue from our "products" in the software and sensors segment, which is generally from the sales of sensors, including on-officer body cameras, axon fleet cameras, other hardware sensors, warranties on sensors, and other products.

●   the "taser" segment includes the manufacture and sale of ceds, batteries, accessories and extended warranties and other products and services;

38
o   service revenue in this segment also includes digital subscription training content, vr training content, taser evidence.com, and other professional services tied to taser and vr deployments.

within the software and sensors segment, we include only revenues and costs attributable to that segment which costs include: costs of sales for both products and services, direct labor, and product management and r&d for products included, or to be included, within the software and sensors segment. all other costs are included in the taser segment. sales, general and administrative expenses are reported on a consolidated basis.

net sales for the taser segment increased $94.6 million, or 21.7%, primarily as a result of an increase of $89.0 million in taser 7 devices and a $28.8 million increase in cartridge revenue. the increase in taser 7 revenue is the result of increased unit sales and higher average selling prices. we continue to see a shift to purchases of taser 7 from legacy devices. cartridge revenue increased due to increased unit sales and higher average selling prices due to product mix shift from legacy handles to taser 7. axon evidence and cloud services revenue increased based on the increased number of taser 7 devices in the field. partially offsetting the increases was a decrease in revenue of legacy devices of $40.9 million. the decrease was attributable to decreased unit sales and was partially offset by higher average selling prices.
net sales for the software and sensors segment increased $231.9 million, or 54.4%. revenue from axon evidence and cloud services increased $125.9 million as we continued to add users to our network during the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase in the aggregate number of users and devices also resulted in increased extended warranty revenues of $16.1 million. sales of our axon body 3 camera drove most of the $48.7 million increase in axon body revenue and the $5.6 million increase in axon dock revenue. fleet revenue increased $38.7 million driven by an increase in both units and higher average selling prices, driven largely by fleet 3.
backlog - as of december 31, 2022 compared to december 31, 2021
our backlog for products and services includes all orders that have been received and are believed to be firm. we define backlog as cumulative bookings, net of cancellations, less product and service revenue recognized to date. bookings are generally realized as revenue over multiple years.
the taser segment backlog balance was $824.4 million as of december 31, 2022. this backlog balance includes $111.0 million of deferred revenue, and $713.5 million that has been recorded as bookings but not yet invoiced, all as of december 31, 2022. we expect to realize approximately $176.8 million of the december 31, 2022 backlog balance as revenue during the next 12 months.
the software and sensors backlog balance was $3.8 billion as of december 31, 2022. this backlog balance includes $497.1 million of deferred revenue, and $3.3 billion that has been recorded as bookings but not yet invoiced, all as of december 31, 2022. we expect to realize approximately $780.7 million of the december 31, 2022 backlog balance as revenue during the next 12 months.

other sg&a expenses increased by $32.8 million, reflecting higher headcount and the following:
●   travel expenses increased $8.4 million reflecting increased in-person customer and vendor meetings. increased travel costs per trip also impacted higher travel expenses.

●   professional, consulting and lobbying expenses increased $5.2 million, driven primarily by initiatives supporting company growth and expansion.

●   depreciation and amortization increased $4.5 million primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense following the implementation of several phases of our enterprise resource planning and related systems during 2021.

net sales for the taser segment decreased $8.1 million, or 5.6%, on a sequential basis primarily due to a $10.5 million decrease in revenue from taser 7 devices. this is tied to shipment timing on hardware, and we see healthy demand for taser products and services for 2023. the decrease in taser 7 revenues was partially offset by an increase in axon evidence revenue of $1.8 million and increased cartridge revenue of $1.1 million of other taser devices. the decrease in revenue was a result of decreased unit sales, and was partially offset by higher average selling prices on our taser 7 devices. the increase in axon evidence revenue was a result of more taser devices in the field, as well as higher vr revenue. cartridge revenue increased due to increased units, partially offset by lower average selling prices.
net sales for the software and sensors segment increased $32.5 million, or 19.5%, on a sequential basis primarily due to a $16.4 million increase in axon evidence and cloud services revenue and a $13.0 million increase in axon

fleet revenue. the increase in axon evidence and cloud services revenue was a result of the increase in the aggregate number of users on our network. axon fleet revenue was driven primarily by increased unit sales, partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price.
international sales were $55.5 million in for the three months ended december 31, 2022 as compared to $47.1 million for the three months ended september 30, 2022, an increase of $8.4 million, primarily driven by increased sales in the emea region.

●   adjusted ebitda (most comparable gaap measure: net income) - earnings before interest expense, investment interest income, taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, realized and unrealized gains and losses on strategic investments and marketable securities, and certain other pre-tax items.

although these non-gaap financial measures are not consistent with gaap, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-gaap financial measures when assessing our operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. however, management recognizes that:
●   these non-gaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered only as a supplement to our gaap financial measures;

●   these non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, our gaap financial measures;

●   these non-gaap financial measures should not be considered to be superior to our gaap financial measures; and

●   these non-gaap financial measures were not prepared in accordance with gaap and investors should not assume that the non-gaap financial measures presented in this annual report on form 10-k were prepared under a comprehensive set of rules or principles.

liquidity and capital resources summary as of december 31, 2022, we had $353.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $2.6 million from december 31, 2021. cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of $689.6 million from december 31, 2021.
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):

year ended december 31,
2022                                      2021
operating activities                                                           $235,361                  $124,494
investing activities                                                                  (830,967)                   252,556
financing activities                                                                    598,100                 (174,181)
effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents                            (3,380)                   (1,982)
net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash       $(886)                    $200,887
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 of $235.4 million consisted of $147.1 million in net income, a net add-back of non-cash income statement items totaling $69.2 million, and an $19.1 million net change in operating assets and liabilities. included in the non-cash items were $106.2 million in stock-based compensation expense, a $98.9 million net gain on the change in fair value of strategic investments and marketable securities, $24.4 million in depreciation and amortization expense, and a $22.1 million increase in deferred income tax assets. cash provided by operations was impacted by an increase of $73.2 million in accounts and notes receivable and contract assets, which was largely attributable to increased sales in 2022, particularly for sales made under subscription plans. cash provided by operations was also impacted by an increase of $52.2 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, resulting
46
primarily from an increase in deferred commissions expense offset by a decrease in income tax receivable due to utilization of overpayments, plus an increase of $96.0 million in inventory as we proactively built up inventory to help meet future product demand. partially offsetting this activity was an increase in deferred revenue of $159.7 million, which was primarily attributable to increased subscription invoicing for software and sensors hardware and services in advance of fulfillment, and a smaller increase in hardware deferred revenue from taser subscription sales.
investing activities we used $831.0 million for investing activities in 2022. cash outflows from investing activities included $692.2 million for purchases of available-for-sale investments, net of proceeds from calls and maturities, $74.3 million for new strategic minority investments and $6.6 million for the exercise of price of warrants related to our strategic investments. we also invested $55.5 million in the purchase of property and equipment and intangibles, net of proceeds on disposals.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was $598.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds of $603.0 million from issuing the notes and warrants and the purchase of the note hedge. partially offsetting the increase were payments totaling $4.9 million for certain restricted stock units ("rsus") that were net-share settled, such that we withheld shares to cover the employees' tax obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities.
liquidity and capital resources our most significant source of liquidity continues to be funds generated by operating activities and available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. in addition, our $200.0 million revolving credit facility is available for additional working capital needs or investment opportunities. under the terms of the line of credit, available borrowings are reduced by outstanding letters of credit. advances under the line of credit bear interest at term sofr plus 1.25 to 1.75% per year determined in accordance with a pricing grid based on our net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") ratio. "sofr" is defined as a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the federal reserve bank of new york or a successor administrator of the secured overnight financing rate.
as of december 31, 2022, we had letters of credit outstanding of $7.0 million, leaving the net amount available for borrowing of $193.0 million the credit agreement will mature on the earlier of december 15, 2027 or the date that is six months prior to the stated maturity date of the 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2027 unless such notes have been redeemed, repurchased, converted or defeased in full. additionally, the credit agreement has an accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total line of credit up to $300.0 million, subject to each lender's sole discretion. at december 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no borrowings under the line.
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility.
our agreement with the bank requires us to comply with a net leverage ratio, defined as consolidated total indebtedness to ebitda, of no greater than 3.50 to 1.00 based upon a trailing four fiscal quarter period. at december 31, 2022, our net leverage ratio was 0.97 to 1.00. additionally, we must comply with a consolidated interest coverage ratio, defined as ebitda to consolidated interest expense, of no less than 3.50 to 1.00 based upon a trailing four fiscal quarter end. we are compliant with the consolidated interest coverage ratio, which is not meaningful for the year ended december 31, 2022.
taser subscription and installment purchase arrangements typically involve amounts invoiced in five equal installments at the beginning of each year of the five-year term. this is in contrast to a traditional ced sale in which
47
the entire amount being charged for the hardware is invoiced upon shipment. this impacts liquidity in a commensurate fashion, with the cash for the subscription or installment purchase received in five annual installments rather than up front. our strategy includes continuing to shift an increasing amount of our business to a subscription model, to better match the municipal budgeting process of our customers as well as to allow for multiple product offerings to be bundled into existing subscriptions. we carefully considered the cash flow impacts of this strategic shift and regularly revisit our cash flow forecast with the goal of maintaining a comfortable level of liquidity as we continue to offer products and services in which we incur upfront cash costs to produce and fulfill hardware sales ahead of the cash inflows from our customers.
based on our strong balance sheet at december 31, 2022 and successful convertible senior notes offering completed during 2022, we believe financing will be available, both through our existing credit line and possible additional financing. however, there is no assurance that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
we believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions or investments, income and payroll tax payments for net-settled stock awards, and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. we and our board of directors may consider repurchases of our common stock. further repurchases of our common stock would take place on the open market, would be financed with available cash and are subject to authorization as well as market and business conditions.
contractual obligations the following table outlines our future contractual financial obligations by period in which payment is expected, as of december 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands):

short                long total                 term                 term operating lease obligations                                    $55,893               $8,448               $47,445
purchase obligations                                                   915,102              544,341               370,761
principal amount payable on our convertible senior notes               690,000              -                     690,000
total contractual obligations                                  $1,660,995            $552,789             $1,108,206
purchase obligations in the table above represent $499.7 million of open purchase orders and $415.4 million of other purchase obligations. the open purchase orders represent both cancelable and non-cancelable purchase orders with key vendors, which are included in this table due to our strategic relationships with these vendors.
for additional information regarding our convertible senior notes, refer to note 12 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
we are subject to u.s. federal income tax as well as income taxes imposed by state and foreign jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2022, we had $21.5 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. the settlement period for these long-term income tax liabilities cannot be determined; however, the liabilities are expected to increase by approximately $0.9 million within the next 12 months.
critical accounting estimates we have identified the following accounting estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the preparation of this annual report on form 10-k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. while we do not believe that a change in these estimates is reasonably likely, there can
48
be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from these estimates. the effect of these estimates on our business operations is discussed below.
standard warranties we warranty our ceds, axon cameras and certain related accessories from manufacturing defects on a limited basis for a period of one year after purchase and, thereafter, will replace any defective unit for a fee. estimated costs for the standard warranty are charged to cost of products sold when revenue is recorded for the related product. future warranty costs are estimated on a quarterly basis based on historical data related to warranty claims and this rate is applied to current product sales. historically, reserve amounts have been increased if management becomes aware of a component failure or other issue that could result in larger than anticipated warranty claims from customers. the warranty reserve is reviewed quarterly to verify that it sufficiently reflects the remaining warranty obligations based on the anticipated expenditures over the balance of the warranty obligation period, and adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates. the warranty reserve is included in accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, our warranty reserve was approximately $0.8 million and $2.8 million, respectively. warranty expense for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $0.2 million, $2.9 million and $0.0 million, respectively. warranty expense for the year ended december 31, 2022 was impacted by lower than expected warranty claims for the axon on-officer body cameras and taser 7 handles. warranty expense for the year ended december 31, 2021, was impacted by higher battery degradation resulting in shorter battery lives for the axon body 3 on-officer body camera and warranty claims for taser 7 handles. warranty expense for the year ended december 31, 2020 was impacted by lower than expected warranty claims for the axon body 3 on-officer body camera.
revenue related to separately-priced extended warranties is initially recorded as deferred revenue at its allocated amount and subsequently recognized as net sales on a straight-line basis over the warranty service period. costs related to extended warranties are charged to cost of product and service sales when incurred.
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out ("fifo") basis, or net realizable value, net of an inventory valuation allowance. we use a standard cost methodology to approximate the cost basis for our inventories. costs include allocations for materials, labor, and overhead. all variances between actual costs and standard costs are apportioned to inventory and cost of product sales based upon inventory turnover. additional provisions are made to reduce excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventories to their net realizable value. these provisions are based on management's best estimate after considering historical demand, projected future demand, inventory purchase commitments, industry and market trends and conditions among other factors. we evaluate inventory costs for abnormal costs due to excess production capacity and treat such costs as period costs.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded provisions to reduce inventories to their lower of cost and net realizable value of approximately $1.5 million compared to $0.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2021.
revenue recognition, deferred revenue and accounts and notes receivable and contract assets we derive revenue from two primary sources: (1) the sale of physical products, including conducted energy devices ("ceds"), axon cameras, axon signal enabled devices, corresponding hardware extended warranties, and related accessories such as axon docks, cartridges and batteries, among others, and (2) subscriptions to our axon evidence digital evidence management software-as-a-service ("saas") (including data storage fees and other ancillary services), which includes varying levels of support. to a lesser extent, we also recognize revenue from training, professional services and other software and saas services. we apply the five-step model outlined in accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 606, revenue from contracts from customers ("topic 606"). for additional discussion of the adoption of topic 606, see note 2.
49
a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in topic 606. for contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our estimate of the standalone selling price ("ssp") of each distinct good or service in the contract.
revenues are recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which is generally distinct and accounted for as a separate performance obligation. revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns.
performance obligations to deliver products, including ceds, cameras and related accessories such as cartridges, batteries and docks, are generally satisfied at the point in time we ship the product, as this is when the customer obtains control of the asset under our standard terms and conditions. in certain contracts with non-standard terms and conditions, these performance obligations may not be satisfied until formal customer acceptance occurs. performance obligations to fulfill service-type extended warranties and provide our saas offerings, including axon evidence and other cloud services, are generally satisfied over time as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of these services over the stated service period.
many of our products and services are sold on a standalone basis. we also bundle our hardware products and services together and sell them to our customers in single transactions, where the customer can make payments over a multi-year period. these sales may include payments for upfront hardware and services, as well as payments for hardware and services to be provided by us at a future date.
additionally, we offer customers the ability to purchase ced cartridges and certain services on an unlimited basis over the contractual term. due to the unlimited nature of these arrangements whereby we are obligated to deliver unlimited products at the customer's request, we account for these arrangements as stand-ready obligations and recognize revenue ratably over the contract period. cost of product sales is recognized when control of hardware products or accessories have transferred to the customer.
we have elected to recognize shipping costs as an expense in cost of product sales when the control of hardware products or accessories have transferred to the customer.
sales tax collected on sales is netted against government remittances and thus, recorded on a net basis.
the timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. we generally have an unconditional right to consideration when we invoice our customers and record a receivable. we record a contract asset when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or a contract liability (deferred revenue) when revenue will be recognized subsequent to invoicing. contract asset amounts that will be invoiced during the subsequent twelve month period from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets and the remaining portion is recorded within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. deferred revenue that will be recognized during the subsequent twelve month period from the balance sheet date is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as long-term deferred revenue. generally, customers are billed in annual installments. see note 2 for further disclosures about our contract assets.
sales are typically made on credit, and we generally do not require collateral. we are exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of products and services. our expected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable, notes receivable, and contract assets is developed using historical collection experience, published or estimated credit default rates for entities that represent our customer base, current and future economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of customers' trade accounts receivables. we review receivables for u.s. and international customers separately to better reflect different published credit default rates and economic and market conditions. additionally, specific reserve amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. our monitoring activities include account reconciliation, dispute resolution, payment
50
confirmation, consideration of customers' financial condition and macroeconomic conditions. balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible.
valuation of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets we evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of these assets may not be recoverable. such circumstances could include, but are not limited to, a change in the product mix, a change in the way products are created, produced or delivered, or a significant change in the way products are branded and marketed. in performing the review for recoverability, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss, if impairment exists, is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amounts of the assets over their estimated fair value computed using discounted cash flows.
finite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives; rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. we perform our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded $5.3 million of impairment charges. of this total, $3.3 million related to the cease-use of a portion of our seattle office. an additional $1.4 million related to the decision to slow pacing on construction of our new scottsdale, arizona campus. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we recorded an immaterial amount of impairment charges. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we abandoned certain planning and site development activities related to our planned new headquarters, resulting in an impairment charge of $0.7 million. additionally, we recognized impairment charges totaling $0.5 million related to improvements and remodeling of certain of our offices. during the year ended december 31, 2022, these charges were included in sales, general and administrative expense, except for $2.7 million related to the seattle office lease cease-use, which was recorded in r&d, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
income taxes we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. we also recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards.
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. we must also assess whether uncertain tax positions as filed could result in the recognition of a liability for possible interest and penalties if any. we have completed research and development tax credit studies for each year a tax credit was claimed for federal and state income tax purposes. we determined that it was more likely than not that the full benefit of the research and development tax credit would not be sustained on examination and accordingly, have established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $21.5 million as of december 31, 2022. we expect the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit to increase by approximately $0.9 million within the next 12 months. should the unrecognized tax benefit of $21.5 million be recognized, our effective tax rate would be favorably impacted. our estimates are based on information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provision. our income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state, and local governments, generally years after the returns are filed. these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws.
our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. our estimates of current and deferred tax
51
assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting or tax laws in the u.s. and internationally, or changes in other facts or circumstances. in addition, we recognize liabilities for potential tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, or if the actual tax liability is greater than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit, or additional income tax expense, respectively, in our consolidated financial statements.
in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including operating results, ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. a valuation allowance is established if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business.
we have state net operating loss ("nols") of $89.5 million, which expire at various dates between 2026 and 2041 or carryforward indefinitely. we anticipate sufficient future pre-tax book income to realize a large portion of our deferred tax assets. however, based on expected income for years in which arizona r&d tax credits are set to expire, unrealized investment losses for which realization is uncertain, and specific identified intangibles with an indefinite life, a reserve of $26.4 million has been recorded as a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2022.
stock-based compensation we have historically granted stock-based compensation to key employees and non-employee directors as a means of attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel. stock-based compensation awards primarily consist of service-based rsus, performance-based rsus, and performance-based stock options. our stock-based compensation awards are classified as equity and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. for service-based awards, we recognize rsu expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period. vesting of performance-based rsus is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria related to our operating performance, as well as successful and timely development and market acceptance of future product introductions. for performance-based rsus containing only performance conditions, compensation cost is recognized using the graded attribution model over the explicit or implicit service period. for awards containing multiple service, performance or market conditions, where all conditions must be satisfied prior to vesting, compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is defined as the longest explicit, implicit or derived service period, based on management's estimate of the probability and timing of the performance criteria being satisfied, adjusted at each balance sheet date. for both service-based and performance-based rsus, we account for forfeitures as they occur as a reduction to stock-based compensation expense and additional paid-in-capital.
for performance-based options, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance goals when the achievement of each individual performance goal becomes probable. for performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement. the fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulations. refer to note 16 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements within this annual report on form 10-k.
we have granted a total of approximately 15.3 million performance-based awards (options and restricted stock units) of which approximately 3.8 million are outstanding as of december 31, 2022, the vesting of which is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria including the successful development and market acceptance of future product introductions as well as our future sales targets and operating performance and market capitalization. of the 3.8 million performance-based awards that are outstanding, 1.4 million are options that are exercisable.

compensation expense for performance awards will be recognized based on management's best estimate of the probability of the performance criteria being satisfied using the most currently available projections of future product adoption and operating performance, adjusted at each balance sheet date. changes in the subjective and probability-based assumptions can materially affect the estimates of the fair value of the awards and timing of recognition of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive income.
contingencies and accrued litigation expense we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including product-related and other litigation. we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. refer to note 13 of our consolidated financial statements within this annual report on form 10-k.
reserve for expected credit losses we are exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of products and services. our expected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable, notes receivable, and contract assets is developed using historical collection experience, published or estimated credit default rates for entities that represent our customer base, current and future economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of customers' trade accounts receivables. additionally, specific allowance amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. our monitoring activities include account reconciliation, dispute resolution, payment confirmation, consideration of customers' financial condition and macroeconomic conditions. balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible.
we review receivables for u.s. and international customers separately to better reflect different published credit default rates and economic and market conditions.
a majority of our customers are governmental agencies. due to municipal government funding rules, certain of our contracts are subject to appropriation, termination for convenience, or similar cancellation clauses, which could allow our customers to cancel or not exercise options to renew contracts in the future. economic slowdowns that negatively affect municipal tax collections and put pressure on law enforcement may increase this risk and negatively impact the realizability of our accounts and notes receivable and contract assets.
based on the balances of our financial instruments as of december 31, 2022, a hypothetical 25 percent increase in expected credit loss rates across all pools would result in a $0.8 million increase in the allowance for expected credit losses.

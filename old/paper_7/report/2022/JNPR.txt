________________________________
(1) dso is for the fourth quarter ended december 31, 2022, and 2021.
(2) includes deferred revenue from hardware solutions, software licenses, software support and maintenance and saas offerings sold in our automated wan solutions, cloud-ready data center, and ai-driven enterprise customer solution categories.
•net revenues: net revenues increased during 2022 compared to 2021 across all of our verticals, customer solutions, and geographies. service net revenues increased primarily due to strong sales of software subscriptions.
•gross margin: gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased during 2022 compared to 2021. product gross margin decreased primarily due to incremental component costs due to supply chain constraints and product mix, partially offset by higher software revenue and pricing actions. the decrease in product gross margin was partially offset by the increase in service gross margin, which was primarily due to higher revenue and lower service delivery costs.
•operating margin: operating income as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by the drivers described in the gross margin discussion above and higher personnel-related expenses driven by an increase in headcount.
•operating cash flows: net cash provided by operations decreased primarily due to higher supplier payments for inventory and contract manufacturer deposits in order to address significant industry-wide supply constraints. as of december 31, 2022, our inventory balance was $642.9 million, an increase of $358.7 million from the prior year, and our contract manufacturer deposit balance was $434.7 million, an increase of $210.9 million from the prior year. we also had approximately $140 million in tax payments attributed to the capitalization and amortization requirements for r&d expenditures pursuant to the tax act. the increase in payments was partially offset by higher collections from increased invoicing activity.
•capital return: we continue to return capital to our stockholders. during 2022, we repurchased a total of 9.2 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $32.32 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $299.7 million. during 2022, we paid quarterly dividends of $0.21 per share, for an aggregate amount of $270.4 million.
•dso: dso is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net revenues for the preceding 90 days. dso increased, primarily driven by higher overall invoicing, partially offset by higher revenue.
•deferred revenue: total deferred revenue increased, primarily driven by an increase in deferrals of saas and software license subscriptions.
global component shortage and covid-19 pandemic update we continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business operations on a regional, national, and global basis. in 2022, we reopened our facilities world-wide for office-based employees in a new office/hybrid collaboration model. we do not expect the pandemic to have a substantial net impact on our consolidated operating results or our liquidity position.
we have a global supply chain, which is primarily composed of manufacturing partners and component suppliers. global supply chain constraints in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic have resulted in disruption to our production schedule due to both constrained manufacturing capacity as well as component parts shortages as our component vendors were also facing manufacturing challenges. these challenges resulted in extended lead times of certain products to our customers, increased logistics costs, and impacted the volume of products we were able to deliver, which negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue. to meet our customer needs, our supply chain team has been executing on a strong risk mitigation plan to resolve our challenges, further enhance our supply chain resiliency, and mitigate the effects of disruptions including, multi-sourcing, pre-ordering components, transforming our logistics network, prioritizing critical customers, and partnering on solutions that limit disruptions to our operations while ensuring the safety of our employees, partners, and suppliers.
similar to others, we continue to experience elevated component costs and inventory balances. these have had a negative impact on our gross margin and operating cash flow. we believe some of the strength in previous product orders was attributable to these industry supply chain challenges that were causing certain customers to place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed, which resulted in significantly elevated backlog levels. in the third and fourth quarter of 2022, we saw a decline in product orders as buying patterns normalized and customers consumed previously placed orders. we anticipate backlog to remain at elevated levels but expect it to decline as supply improves.
we believe the extended lead times and increased component and logistic costs will modestly improve through the course of 2023. we have taken pricing actions to mitigate some of the effects of rising component costs and general inflationary pressures arising from supply chain constraints as well as overall macroeconomic conditions, and expect these actions to have a more substantial impact in 2023. while the situation is dynamic, at this point in time, we believe we will have access to sufficient supplies of semiconductors and other components and will be able to meet our full-year financial forecast. see the section entitled "risk factors" in item 1a of part ii of this report for further discussion of this risk.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. gaap requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. note 1, description of business, basis of presentation and significant accounting policies, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
the below accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.
•revenue recognition: we enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while most of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements that contain non-standard terms and conditions and include promises to transfer multiple goods or services. as a result, significant interpretation and judgment are sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions, including: (1) whether performance obligations are considered distinct that should be accounted for separately versus together, how the price should be allocated among the performance obligations, and when to recognize revenue for each performance obligation; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price, or ssp, of each distinct performance obligation; (3) combining contracts that may impact the allocation of the transaction price between product and services; and (4) estimating and accounting for variable consideration, including rights of return, rebates, price protection, expected penalties or other price concessions as a reduction of the transaction price.
our estimates of ssp for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factors, including, but not limited to, historical discounting trends for products and services, pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs, competitor pricing strategies, and industry technology lifecycles. our estimates for rights of return, rebates, and price protection are based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria outlined in customer contracts or rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. our estimates for expected penalties and other price concessions are based on historical trends and expectations regarding future incurrence.
changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition.
•income taxes: we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. we apply the authoritative accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our taxes including the interpretation and application of gaap and complex domestic and international tax laws and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 1, description of business, basis of presentation and significant accounting policies, in notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on financial condition and results of operations, which is incorporated herein by reference.

our gross margins as a percentage of net revenues have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including general inflationary pressures, the mix and average selling prices of our products and services, new product introductions and enhancements, manufacturing, component and logistics costs, expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations, cost of support and service personnel, customer mix as we continue to expand our footprint with certain strategic customers, the mix of distribution channels through which our products and services are sold, and import tariffs. for example, our logistics and other supply chain-related costs have increased due to the ongoing global component shortage. for more information on the impact of supply chain constraints on our business, see the "risk factors" section of item 1a of part i of this report.
product gross margin product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues decreased primarily due to $64.8 million in incremental component costs due to supply chain constraints and product mix, partially offset by higher software revenue and pricing actions. we continue to undertake specific efforts to address certain factors impacting our product gross margin. these efforts include performance and quality improvements through engineering to increase value across our products; optimizing our supply chain and service business; pricing management; and increasing software and solution sales.
service gross margin service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased primarily due to higher revenue and lower delivery costs.

our operating expenses have historically been driven in large part by personnel-related costs, including salaries and wages; commissions and bonuses, which we refer to collectively as variable compensation; benefits; share-based compensation; and travel. facility and information technology, or it, departmental costs are allocated to each department based on usage and headcount. we had a total of 10,901 and 10,191 employees as of december 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. our headcount increased by 710 employees, or 7%, primarily from hiring for the research and development and sales and marketing organizations. we expect inflationary pressures to impact operating expense, at least for the next twelve months.
research and development research and development expense, or r&d, increased primarily due to higher personnel-related costs driven by headcount growth.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense, or s&m, increased primarily due to higher personnel-related costs driven by headcount growth, higher variable compensation and higher travel expenses, as well as higher costs associated with marketing initiatives.
restructuring charges restructuring charges decreased primarily due to lower contract termination, facility consolidation, severance and other exit-related costs recorded in 2022 under the 2022 restructuring plan, compared to the charges recorded in 2021 under the 2021 restructuring plan.

income tax provision the following table presents income tax provision (in millions, except percentages):

effective tax rate            11.3   %                  18.5   %
the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than fiscal year 2021, primarily due to the net difference in discrete items in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 and a change in the geographic mix of earnings. for a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% and further explanation of our income tax provision, see note 13, income taxes, in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report.
beginning january 1, 2022, as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ("tax act"), all our u.s. and non-u.s. based r&d expenditures are being capitalized and amortized over five and fifteen years, respectively. in 2022, the new regulations resulted in incremental cash tax payments of approximately $140 million and a reduction in our effective tax rate due to increased benefit from u.s. foreign-derived intangible income. in 2023, the new regulations are expected to result in incremental cash tax payments of up to $25 million related to 2022. the actual impact on future cash flow from operations will primarily depend on if and when this legislation is deferred, modified, or repealed by the u.s. congress, including if retroactively, and the amount of r&d expenditures paid or incurred in those respective years. we estimate the largest impact will have been to 2022 cash flow from operations and that the impact in future years should gradually decrease over the five- and fifteen-year amortization periods. the company's future effective tax rate may be impacted.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions, investments in strategic relationships, repurchases of shares of our common stock, and payment of cash dividends on our common stock. since the enactment of the tax act, we have repatriated a significant amount of cash from outside of the u.s., and plan to continue to repatriate on an ongoing basis. we intend to use the repatriated cash to invest in the business, support value-enhancing mergers and acquisitions, and fund our return of capital to stockholders.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term, and long-term investments, cash generated from operations together with the revolving credit facility and our ability to access to capital markets will be sufficient to fund our operations; planned stock repurchases and dividends; capital expenditures; purchase commitments and other liquidity requirements; and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. however, our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including, but not limited to, our growth rate; the timing and amount we spend to support development efforts; the expansion of sales and marketing activities; the introduction of new and enhanced products and services; the costs to acquire or invest in businesses and technologies; an increase in manufacturing or component costs; and the risks and uncertainties detailed in the "risk factors" section of item 1a of part i of this report.
the company's material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.
debt as of december 31, 2022, we had outstanding fixed-rate senior notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $1,700.0 million (collectively the "notes"), none of which is payable within 12 months. future interest payments associated with the notes total $650.0 million, with $55.4 million payable within 12 months.
purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and in the interest of having access to adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and certain suppliers to procure inventory based on the company's requirements. a significant portion of the company's purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm and non-cancelable commitments. in certain instances, these agreements allow the company the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust its requirements based on the company's business needs prior to firm orders being placed. as of december 31, 2022, we had purchase commitments of $2,476.3 million, with $2,101.1 million payable within 12 months.
tax our transition tax liability represents future cash payments on accumulated foreign earnings of subsidiaries as a result of the tax act. the company has elected to pay its transition tax, net of applicable tax refunds, over the eight-year period provided in the tax act. as of december 31, 2022, the balance of our transition tax obligation was $250.6 million, with $52.1 million payable within 12 months.
as of december 31, 2022, the company had $81.0 million included in long-term income taxes payable on the consolidated balance sheets for unrecognized tax positions. at this time, the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.
in 2022, we made tax payments of approximately $253.2 million of which approximately $140 million can be attributed to the capitalization and amortization requirements for r&d expenditures pursuant to the tax act.
leases the company leases its facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases that have remaining lease terms of 1 to 9 years and 1 to 4 years, respectively. as of december 31, 2022, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $177.3 million, with $48.7 million payable within 12 months.
unconditional purchase obligations - other unconditional purchase obligations consist of agreements that include firm and non-cancelable terms to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum amounts or quantities to be purchased at fixed or minimum prices. as of december 31, 2022, we had unconditional purchase obligations of $96.8 million, with $48.4 million payable within 12 months. see note 15, commitments and contingencies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our unconditional purchase obligations.
guarantees we have financial guarantees consisting of third-party financing arrangements extended to end-user customers and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities, insurance programs, and customs of $27.4 million as of december 31, 2022.
capital return in addition to our cash requirements, we have a capital return program authorized by the board of directors (the "board"). in january 2018, the board, approved a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, which we refer to as the 2018 stock repurchase program. in october 2019, the board authorized a $1.0 billion increase to the 2018 stock repurchase program for a total of $3.0 billion.
during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $32.32 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $299.7 million, under the 2018 stock repurchase program. as of december 31, 2022, there was $0.6 billion of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 stock repurchase program.
future share repurchases under the 2018 stock repurchase program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. our 2018 stock repurchase program may be discontinued at any time. see note 10, equity, in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our share purchase program.
in addition, any future dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, are subject to approval by the board or an authorized committee thereof. see note 16, subsequent events, in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for discussion of our dividend declaration subsequent to december 31, 2022.

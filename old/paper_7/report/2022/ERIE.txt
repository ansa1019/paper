recent accounting standards see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 2, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards and the impact on our financial statements.
table of contents operating overview overview we are a pennsylvania business corporation that since 1925 has been the managing attorney-in-fact for the subscribers (policyholders) at the exchange, a reciprocal insurer that writes property and casualty insurance. our primary function as attorney-in-fact is to perform policy issuance and renewal services on behalf of the subscribers at the exchange. we also act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the exchange, as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services.
the exchange is a reciprocal insurance exchange, which is an unincorporated association of individuals, partnerships and corporations that agree to insure one another. each applicant for insurance to the exchange signs a subscriber's agreement, which contains an appointment of indemnity as their attorney-in-fact to transact the business of the exchange on their behalf.
pursuant to the subscriber's agreement for acting as attorney-in-fact in these two capacities, we earn a management fee. management fee revenue is based upon all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange and the management fee rate, which is not to exceed 25%. our board of directors establishes the management fee rate at least annually, generally in december for the following year.  the process of setting the management fee rate includes the evaluation of current year operating results compared to both prior year and industry estimated results for both indemnity and the exchange, and consideration of several factors for both entities including: their relative financial strength and capital position; projected revenue, expense and earnings for the subsequent year; future capital needs; as well as competitive position. the management fee rate was set at 25% for 2022, 2021 and 2020.  our board of directors set the 2023 management fee rate again at 25%, its maximum level.
our earnings are primarily driven by the management fee revenue generated for the services we provide to the exchange.  the policy issuance and renewal services we provide to the exchange are related to the sales, underwriting and issuance of policies. the sales related services we provide include agent compensation and certain sales and advertising support services. agent compensation includes scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as additional commissions and bonuses to agents, which are earned by achieving targeted measures. agent compensation comprised approximately 66% of our 2022 policy issuance and renewal expenses. the underwriting services we provide include underwriting and policy processing and comprised approximately 10% of our 2022 policy issuance and renewal expenses. the remaining services we provide include customer service and administrative support. we also provide information technology services that support all the functions listed above that comprised approximately 11% of our 2022 policy issuance and renewal expenses. included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these policy issuance and renewal functions.
by virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the exchange does not have any employees or officers. therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through an attorney-in-fact. indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the exchange with respect to its administrative services in accordance with the subscriber's agreement. the exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and indemnity. claims handling services include costs incurred in the claims process, including the adjustment, investigation, defense, recording and payment functions. life insurance management services include costs incurred in the management and processing of life insurance business. investment management services are related to investment trading activity, accounting and all other functions attributable to the investment of funds. in 2022, approximately 71% of the administrative services expenses are entirely attributable to the respective administrative functions (claims handling, life insurance management and investment management), while the remaining 29% of these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these administrative functions. the expenses we incur and related reimbursements we receive for administrative services are presented gross in our statements of operations. the subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to indemnity. reimbursements are settled at cost on a monthly basis. state insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.
our results of operations are tied to the growth and financial condition of the exchange as the exchange is our sole customer, and our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange. the exchange generates revenue by insuring preferred and standard risks, with personal lines comprising 69% of the 2022 direct and affiliated assumed written premiums and commercial lines comprising the remaining 31%.  the principal personal lines products are private passenger automobile and homeowners.  the principal commercial lines products are commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and workers compensation.
we generate investment income from our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios. our portfolio is managed with the objective of maximizing after-tax returns on a risk-adjusted basis. we actively evaluate the portfolios for securities in an table of contents unrealized loss position and record impairment write-downs on investments in instances where we have the intent to sell or it's more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security. impairments resulting from a credit loss are recognized in earnings with a corresponding allowance on the balance sheet.
risks and uncertainties uncertainty resulting from current events, including but not limited to, post-pandemic conditions, supply chain disruptions and certain geopolitical concerns, have influenced various economic factors, including an elevated inflationary environment and rising interest rates over the past year. as these events continue to evolve, the ultimate impact and duration remain uncertain. the following sections provide a summary of the more relevant financial impacts, risk monitoring activities, and operational considerations for indemnity and the exchange.
the impact that the covid-19 pandemic and post-pandemic inflation has on the premiums written by the exchange, our sole customer, affects our management fee revenue. while reduced driving conditions resulting from the covid-19 pandemic prompted the exchange to implement personal and commercial auto rate reductions in 2020, higher severity from continued supply chain disruptions and inflation impacted rate decisions in 2021, resulting in increased average premiums per policy in 2022. there may also be other market and/or regulatory pressures that could impact the exchange's operations. response to the covid-19 pandemic and various recent geopolitical events have also had a significant impact on the global financial markets, including rising interest rates, which could impact future losses and impairments to the investment portfolio. we have provided additional disclosure of these impacted areas throughout our management's discussion and analysis that follows. a broader discussion of the potential future impacts has also been disclosed in financial condition and liquidity and capital resources contained within this report, as well as part i. item 1a. "risk factors" contained within this report.
while we were not required to close our physical locations under the state mandated closure of nonessential services during the pandemic, out of concern for the health and safety of our employees, over 90% of our workforce had been working remotely from march 2020 through april 2022. we did not experience significant interruptions to our core business processes or systems and did not have significant changes to our financial close reporting processes or related internal controls as a result of remote work.  we implemented a phased return of our workforce beginning in april 2022 and transitioned to a predominately hybrid format.  consistent with our process from the beginning of the pandemic, we prioritize the health and safety of our employees and will adjust as appropriate.

nm = not meaningful operating income increased in 2022 compared to 2021 as growth in operating revenue outpaced the growth in operating expenses. management fee revenue is based upon the management fee rate we charge and the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange.  the management fee rate was 25% for 2022, 2021, and 2020.  the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange increased 9.2% to $8.6 billion in 2022 and 3.3% to $7.9 billion in 2021.
cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 7.0% to $1.8 billion in 2022 primarily due to higher scheduled commissions driven by direct and affiliated assumed written premium growth, as well as increased professional fees and technology costs, partially offset by decreased agent incentive compensation driven by higher claims severity and related loss costs experienced by the exchange. cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 5.6% to $1.7 billion in 2021 primarily due to higher commissions driven by direct and affiliated assumed written premium growth, increased technology costs, increased administrative and other costs, and higher agent incentive compensation from profitable growth.
management fee revenue for administrative services remained consistent at $58.3 million in 2022 compared to a decrease of 2.0% in 2021. the administrative services reimbursement revenue and corresponding cost of operations increased both total operating revenue and total operating expenses by $668.3 million in 2022 and $638.5 million in 2021, but had no net impact on operating income.
total investment income decreased $66.7 million in 2022 primarily due to a decrease in net investment income as well as net realized and unrealized investment losses in 2022 compared to net gains in 2021. total investment income increased $34.5 million in 2021 primarily due to an increase in net investment income. the changes in net investment income in both periods were driven by results in our limited partnership portfolio.
general conditions and trends affecting our business economic conditions unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment, and the threat of recession, among others, may lead the exchange's customers to modify coverage, not renew policies, or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the exchange, and consequently our management fee.  the extent to which economic conditions could impact the exchange's operations and our management fee was exacerbated with the covid-19 pandemic and the post-pandemic economic environment. in particular, unanticipated increased inflation costs including medical cost inflation, building material cost inflation, auto repair and replacement cost inflation, and tort issues may impact adequacy of estimated loss reserves and future premium rates of the exchange. the extent and duration of the impacts to economic conditions remain uncertain as post-pandemic conditions continue to evolve. if any of these items impacted the financial condition or operations of the exchange, it could have an impact on our financial results. see financial condition, liquidity and capital resources, and part i, item 1a. "risk factors" contained within this report for a discussion of potential impacts to our operations or those of the exchange.
financial market volatility our portfolio of fixed maturity and equity security investments is subject to market volatility especially in periods of instability in the worldwide financial markets. over time, net investment income could also be impacted by volatility and by the general level of interest rates, which impact reinvested cash flow from the portfolio and business operations. depending upon market conditions, which are unpredictable and remain uncertain, considerable fluctuation could exist in the fair value of our investment portfolio and reported total investment income, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, table of contents results of operations, and cash flows. post-pandemic conditions and various recent geopolitical events have had a significant impact on the global financial markets. the value of our invested assets could be adversely impacted and there is potential for future losses and/or impairments on our investment portfolio resulting from continued supply chain disruptions, further inflationary pressures and rising interest rates.
critical accounting estimates the financial statements include amounts based upon estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures. we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and 2) different estimates that could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are likely to occur from period-to-period, could have a material impact on our statements of operations or financial position.
the following presents a discussion of those accounting policies surrounding estimates that we believe are the most critical to our reported amounts and require the most subjective and complex judgment. if actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions, there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. the estimates and the estimating methods used are reviewed continually, and any adjustments considered necessary are reflected in current earnings.
investment valuation fair value measurements we make estimates concerning the fair value of our investments using valuation techniques to derive the fair value of the fixed maturity and equity investments we hold. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date.
fair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information. we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. our investments are categorized into a three-level fair value hierarchy which assigns a level 1 for highly observable inputs and a level 3 to unobservable inputs. we continually assess whether or not an active market exists for all of our investments and as of each reporting date we re-evaluate their classification in the fair value hierarchy.
as of each reporting period, financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. the presence of at least one unobservable input that has significant impact to the fair value measurement would result in classification as a level 3 instrument. our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset, such as the relative impact on the fair value as a result of including a particular input and market conditions. while estimates of the fair values of our investment portfolio are obtained from outside pricing services, we ultimately determine whether the inputs used are observable or unobservable.
as of december 31, 2022, substantially all of the securities measured at fair value in our investment portfolio are classified as level 2. level 2 securities are valued using industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as the interest rate and credit spread for the underlying financial instruments. all significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable information in the marketplace, or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. at december 31, 2022, our investments classified as level 3 were not significant.
see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 5, fair value, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on the fair value measurement of our investments.
impairments during 2022, as a result of rising interest rates, unrealized losses in our fixed maturity portfolio increased significantly. we regularly monitor our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios for price changes and perform detailed reviews of securities in an unrealized loss position that may indicate that credit-related or other impairments exist. as of december 31, 2022, our intent to sell and credit-related impairments were not material to our financial condition or results of operations.
see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 2, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on impairments of available-for-sale securities.
table of contents retirement benefit plans for employees our pension plans consist of a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and an unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan ("serp") for certain members of executive and senior management. although we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, the exchange and its subsidiaries reimburse us for approximately 58% of the annual benefit expense of these plans, which represents pension benefits for employees performing administrative services and an allocated share of costs for employees in departments that support the administrative functions.
our pension obligation is developed from actuarial estimates.  several statistical and other factors, which attempt to anticipate future events, are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans.  key factors include assumptions about the discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets.  we review these assumptions annually and modify them considering historical experience, current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, and expected future trends.
accumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments.  we discount those cash payments based upon a yield curve developed from corporate bond yield information with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits.  lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense, while higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense.  the construction of the yield curve is based upon yields of corporate bonds rated aa or equivalent quality.  target yields are developed from bonds at various maturity points and a curve is fitted to those targets.  spot rates (zero coupon bond yields) are developed from the yield curve and used to discount benefit payment amounts associated with each future year.  the present value of plan benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.  a single discount rate is then developed to produce the same present value. the cash flows from the yield curve were matched against our projected benefit payments in the pension plan, which have a duration of about 15 years.  this yield curve supported the selection of a 5.67% discount rate for the projected benefit obligation at december 31, 2022 and for the 2023 pension expense.  the same methodology was used to develop the 3.16% and 2.96% discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation for 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the pension expense for 2022 and 2021, respectively. a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would increase pension cost in the following year by $3.6 million, of which our share would be approximately $1.5 million, and would increase the pension benefit obligation by $32.3 million.
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors, including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets.  these unrecognized gains and losses are recorded in the pension plan obligation and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). these amounts are systematically recognized to net periodic pension expense in future periods, with gains decreasing and losses increasing future pension expense. if actuarial net gains or losses exceed 5% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of plan assets, the excess is recognized through the net periodic pension expense equally over the estimated service period of the employee group, which is currently 14 years.
the expected long-term rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid.  to determine the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we utilized models based upon rigorous historical analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets based upon key factors such as historical returns for the asset class' applicable indices, the correlations of the asset classes under various market conditions and consensus views on future real economic growth and inflation.  the expected future return for each asset class is then combined by considering correlations between asset classes and the volatilities of each asset class to produce a reasonable range of asset return results within which our expected long-term rate of return assumption falls. while the expected long-term rate of return is generally less susceptible to annual revisions as there are typically no significant changes in the asset mix, we increased the expected return on asset assumption from 5.50% to 6.50% in 2023 based on the current asset allocation and considering a review of the key factors and expectations of future performance as well as the current market environment. a change of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $2.6 million impact on net pension benefit cost in the following year, of which our share would be approximately $1.1 million.
we use a four-year averaging method to determine the market-related value of plan assets, which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense.  under this methodology, asset gains or losses that result from returns that differ from our long-term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market-related value of assets on a level basis over a four-year period.  the market-related asset experience during 2022 that related to the actual investment return being different from that assumed during the prior year was a loss of $358.6 million. recognition of this loss will be deferred and recognized over a four-year period, consistent with the market-related asset value methodology. once factored into the market-related table of contents asset value, these experience gains and losses will be amortized over a period of 14 years, which is the remaining service period of the employee group.
we expect our net pension benefit cost to decrease from $44.2 million in 2022 to income of $7.8 million in 2023 primarily due to higher discount rates and expected return on assets, partially offset by lower than expected asset returns during 2022. our share of the net pension benefit costs after reimbursements was $18.6 million in 2022. we expect our share of the net pension benefit income to be approximately $3.3 million in 2023, of which expense of $11.5 million will be recorded in operating expense and income of $14.8 million will be recorded in other income.
the actuarial assumptions we used in determining our pension obligation may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants.  while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 9, postretirement benefits, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on the pension plans.
table of contents results of operations management fee revenue we have two performance obligations in the subscriber's agreement, providing policy issuance and renewal services and acting as attorney-in-fact for the exchange, as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services. we earn management fees for acting as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange in these two capacities and allocate our revenues between our performance obligations.
management fee rate the management fee is calculated by multiplying all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange by the management fee rate, which is determined by our board of directors at least annually.  the management fee rate was set at 25%, the maximum rate, for 2022, 2021 and 2020.  changes in the management fee rate can affect our revenue and net income significantly. the transaction price, including management fee revenue and administrative services reimbursement revenue, includes variable consideration and is allocated based on the estimated standalone selling prices developed using industry information and other available information for similar services. we update the transaction price and the related allocation at least annually based upon the most recent information available or more frequently if there have been significant changes in any components considered in the transaction price. our current and prior year transaction price allocation reviews resulted in minor changes in the allocation percentages between the two performance obligations in all periods, which did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

table of contents direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange direct and affiliated assumed premiums include premiums written directly by the exchange and premiums assumed from its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries. direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange increased 9.2% to $8.6 billion in 2022, from $7.9 billion in 2021, primarily driven by increased personal lines and commercial multi-peril premiums written.  year-over-year policies in force for all lines of business increased 3.6% in 2022 as the result of continuing strong policyholder retention and an increase in new policies written, compared to 3.2% in 2021.  the year-over-year average premium per policy for all lines of business increased 5.4% at december 31, 2022, compared to 0.1% at december 31, 2021. the year-over-year average premium per policy at december 31, 2021 was impacted by the rate reductions for personal and commercial auto policies written between january 1, 2021 and june 30, 2021, in response to lower driving activity resulting from the covid-19 pandemic.
premiums generated from new business increased 14.5% to $1.1 billion in 2022. contributing to this change was a 10.4% increase in year-over-year average premium per policy on new business at december 31, 2022 and a 3.7% increase in new business policies written. premiums generated from new business increased 13.2% to $965 million in 2021. new business policies written increased 9.0% in 2021 and year-over-year average premium per policy on new business increased 3.9% at december 31, 2021.
premiums generated from renewal business increased 8.5% to $7.5 billion in 2022, and increased 2.1% to $6.9 billion, in 2021.  underlying the trend in renewal business premiums was an increase in year-over-year policies in force of 3.6% and 2.4% in 2022 and 2021, respectively, driven by a slight increase in policy retention ratios, as well as a 4.7% increase in year-over-year average premium per policy at december 31, 2022, compared to a 0.3% decrease at december 31, 2021.
the exchange implements rate changes in order to meet loss cost expectations. in response to reduced driving conditions in 2020 resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, the exchange implemented $200 million in personal and commercial auto rate reductions on policies written between july 1, 2020 and june 30, 2021. these rate reductions resulted in a decrease to exchange's written premium of approximately $110 million and $90 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively.  claims frequency increased as driving activity returned to near pre-pandemic levels in 2021 and 2022.  inflation-driven severity increases in 2021 and 2022, combined with increasing claim frequency, impacted 2022 underwriting results, and may impact future rate decisions.
as the exchange writes policies with annual terms only, rate actions take 12 months to be fully recognized in written premium and 24 months to be recognized in earned premiums. since rate changes are realized at renewal, it takes 12 months to implement a rate change to all policyholders and another 12 months to earn the increased or decreased premiums in full. as a result, certain rate changes approved in 2021 were reflected in 2022, and a portion of the rate actions approved in 2022 will be reflected in 2023. furthermore, the exchange writes certain personal auto policies with a rate locking feature, which generally extends the amount of time it takes for rate actions to be recognized. the exchange continuously evaluates pricing and product offerings to meet consumer demands.
personal lines - total personal lines premiums written increased 8.4% to $6.0 billion in 2022, from $5.5 billion in 2021, driven by a 4.4% increase in total personal lines year-over-year average premium per policy and a 3.9% increase in total personal lines policies in force. total personal lines policies in force increased 3.1% in 2021 and year-over-year average premium per policy decreased 0.6% at december 31, 2021.
commercial lines - total commercial lines premiums written increased 11.2% to $2.6 billion in 2022, compared to 2021, driven by a 9.0% increase in the total commercial lines year-over-year average premium per policy and a 2.0% increase in total commercial lines policies in force. total commercial lines premiums written increased 5.4% in 2021, compared to 2020, driven by a 3.6% increase in total commercial lines policies in force and a 1.7% increase in the total commercial lines year-over-year average premium per policy.
future trends-premium revenue - through a careful agency selection process, the exchange plans to continue its effort to expand the size of its agency force to increase market penetration in existing operating territories to contribute to future growth.
changes in premium levels attributable to the growth in policies in force directly affect the profitability of the exchange and have a direct bearing on our management fee. our continued focus on underwriting discipline and the maturing of pricing sophistication models have contributed to the exchange's steady policy retention ratios. the continued growth of its policy base is dependent upon the exchange's ability to retain existing and attract new subscribers/policyholders. a lack of new policy growth or the inability to retain existing customers could have an adverse effect on the exchange's premium level growth, and consequently our management fee.
changes in premium levels attributable to rate changes also directly affect the profitability of the exchange and have a direct bearing on our management fee. pricing actions contemplated or taken by the exchange are subject to various regulatory requirements of the states in which it operates. the pricing actions already implemented, or to be implemented, have an effect table of contents on the market competitiveness of the exchange's insurance products. such pricing actions, and those of the exchange's competitors, could affect the ability of the exchange's agents to retain and attract new business; additionally, exposure reductions and/or changes in mix of business as a result of post-pandemic economic conditions or other significant unexpected events could impact the average direct and affiliated assumed premium written by the exchange, as customers may reduce coverages. future premiums could also be impacted by changes resulting from the continued inflationary trends and potential regulatory changes resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, among others. the extent of the impact to the exchange's premiums and our management fee cannot be estimated with a high degree of certainty at this time given the ongoing developments related to supply chain disruptions and current inflationary trends. see also part i, item 1a.

policy issuance and renewal services we allocate a portion of the management fee, which currently equates to 24.3% of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange, for providing policy issuance and renewal services. the allocation of management fee for these services was 24.3% and 24.2% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. this portion of the management fee is recognized as revenue when the policy is issued or renewed because it is at that time that the services we provide are substantially complete and the executed insurance policy is transferred to the customer. the increase in management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services was driven by the increase in the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange discussed previously.
service agreement revenue service agreement revenue primarily consists of service charges we collect from subscribers/policyholders for providing multiple payment plans on policies written by the exchange and its property and casualty subsidiaries and also includes late payment and policy reinstatement fees.  the service charges are fixed dollar amounts per billed installment.  in july 2021, we also began receiving service agreement revenue from the exchange for the use of shared office space, which increased service agreement revenue by $2.0 million in 2022 compared to 2021.

table of contents commissions - commissions increased $71.1 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by the growth in direct and affiliated assumed written premium, partially offset by a decrease in agent incentive compensation. the profitability component of agent incentive compensation decreased due to higher claims severity and related loss costs in 2022. commissions increased $57.2 million in 2021 compared to 2020 resulting from higher direct and affiliated assumed written premium, primarily in lines of business that pay a higher commission rate. to a lesser extent, there was also an increase in agent incentive compensation in 2021 compared to 2020 related to profitable growth.
non-commission expense - non-commission expense increased $47.1 million in 2022 compared to 2021. underwriting and policy processing costs increased $6.4 million primarily due to increased underwriting report, printing, and personnel costs. information technology costs increased $13.1 million primarily due to increased hardware and software costs and professional fees, partially offset by decreased personnel costs. sales and advertising costs increased $7.5 million primarily due to increased advertising and agent-related expenses. administrative and other expenses increased $22.5 million primarily due to an increase in personnel costs related to compensation and increased professional fees.
in 2021, non-commission expense increased $31.3 million compared to 2020. underwriting and policy processing costs increased $4.5 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and underwriting report costs. information technology costs increased $11.3 million primarily due to increased hardware and software costs and personnel costs. administrative and other expenses increased $14.2 million primarily due to increased professional fees and building and equipment depreciation. personnel costs in all categories were impacted by higher medical costs compared to the prior year as the covid-19 pandemic reduced elective procedures in 2020.

administrative services we allocate a portion of the management fee, which currently equates to 0.7% of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange, to the administrative services. the allocation of management fee for these services was 0.7% and 0.8% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. this portion of the management fee is recognized as revenue over a four-year period representing the time over which the services are provided. we also report reimbursed costs as revenues, which are recognized monthly as services are provided. the administrative services expenses we incur and the related reimbursements we receive are recorded gross in the statements of operations.
cost of administrative services by virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the exchange does not have any employees or officers. therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through an attorney-in-fact. indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the exchange with respect to its administrative services in accordance with the subscriber's agreement. the exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and indemnity. the subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to indemnity. reimbursements due from the exchange and its insurance subsidiaries are recorded as a receivable and settled at cost.

net realized and unrealized losses of $27.3 million in 2022 were primarily due to disposals of available-for-sale securities and market value adjustments on equity securities. net realized and unrealized gains of $4.9 million in 2021 were primarily due to disposals of available-for-sale securities, while gains of $6.4 million in 2020 were primarily due to market value adjustments on equity securities and sales of available-for-sale securities.
net impairment (losses) recoveries recognized in earnings net impairment losses of $0.7 million in 2022 were related to available-for-sale securities and include $0.5 million of credit impairment losses and $0.2 million of securities in an unrealized loss position where we had intent to sell prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis. net impairment recoveries of $0.2 million in 2021 were primarily the result of a change in the current expected credit loss allowance related to our agent loans. net impairment losses recognized on available-for-sale securities in 2020 include $2.3 million of securities in an unrealized loss position where we had intent to sell prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis and $0.7 million of credit impairment losses. the remaining 2020 impairments include the change in the current expected credit loss allowance related to our agent loans. the covid-19 pandemic's impact on financial markets contributed to higher impairment losses on our available-for-sale securities during 2020 compared to other years presented.
table of contents financial condition of erie insurance exchange serving in the capacity of attorney-in-fact for the exchange, we are dependent on the growth and financial condition of the exchange, who is our sole customer. the strength of the exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries is rated annually by a.m. best company through assessing its financial stability and ability to pay claims. the ratings are generally based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward return to investors. the exchange and each of its property and casualty subsidiaries are rated a+ "superior", the second highest financial strength rating, which is assigned to companies that have achieved superior overall performance when compared to the standards established by a.m. best and have a superior ability to meet obligations to policyholders over the long term. on august 9, 2022, the outlook for the financial strength rating was affirmed as stable. as of december 31, 2022, only approximately 12% of insurance groups, in which the exchange is included, are rated a+ or higher.
the financial statements of the exchange are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles prescribed by the commonwealth of pennsylvania. financial statements prepared under statutory accounting principles focus on the solvency of the insurer and generally provide a more conservative approach than under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. statutory direct written premiums of the exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries grew 9.2% to $8.6 billion in 2022 from $7.9 billion in 2021. these premiums, along with investment income, are the major sources of cash that support the operations of the exchange. policyholders' surplus, determined under statutory accounting principles, was $10.1 billion and $11.7 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries' year-over-year policy retention ratio continues to be high at 90.5% at december 31, 2022 and 90.1% at december 31, 2021.
we have prepared our financial statements considering the financial strength of the exchange based on its a.m. best rating and strong level of surplus. while policyholders' surplus declined by $1.6 billion from 2021 driven by higher loss costs and realized and unrealized investment losses resulting from post-pandemic economic conditions, we continue to monitor these conditions and believe that the exchange falls within established risk tolerances. however, see part i, item 1a. "risk factors" for possible outcomes that could impact that determination.

we continually review our investment portfolio for impairment and determine whether the impairment is a result of credit loss or other factors. we individually analyze all positions with an emphasis on those in a significant unrealized loss position. if we have the intent to sell or it's more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the entire impairment is recognized in earnings. factors considered in the evaluation of credit loss include the extent to which fair value is less than cost and fundamental factors specific to the issuer such as financial condition, changes in credit ratings, near and long-term business prospects and other factors, as well as the likelihood of recovery of the amortized cost of the security. impairment resulting from credit loss is recognized in earnings with a corresponding allowance on the balance sheet. we believe our investment valuation philosophy and accounting practices result in appropriate and timely measurement of fair value and recognition of impairment.
fixed maturities under our investment strategy, we maintain a fixed maturity portfolio that is of high quality and well diversified within each market sector. this investment strategy also achieves a balanced maturity schedule. our fixed maturity portfolio is managed with the goal of achieving reasonable returns while limiting exposure to risk.
fixed maturities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, included in shareholders' equity. net unrealized losses on fixed maturities, net of deferred taxes, totaled $52.5 million at december 31, 2022, compared to net unrealized gains of $6.2 million at december 31, 2021. the increase in investment portfolio positions with unrealized losses contributed to an increase in our deferred tax assets. our evaluation of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance included available tax planning strategies that could be implemented, if necessary, to support the realizability of deferred tax assets. we believe those tax strategies are feasible and prudent.

shareholders' equity postretirement benefit plans the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans is recognized in the statements of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. at december 31, 2022, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans increased by $76.5 million, net of tax, of which $6.9 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial loss and $69.6 million represents the current period actuarial gain.  the 2022 actuarial gain was driven by the higher discount rate, offset by lower than expected return on plan assets. at december 31, 2021, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans increased by $70.0 million, net of tax, of which $13.9 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial loss and $56.1 million represents the current period actuarial gain.  the 2021 actuarial gain was primarily due to higher than expected return on plan assets. although we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, the exchange and its subsidiaries reimburse us for approximately 58% of the annual benefit expense of these plans, which represents pension benefits for employees performing administrative services and an allocated share of costs for employees in departments that support the administrative functions.
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we continue to monitor the sufficiency of our liquidity and capital resources given the potential impact of recent geopolitical events and ongoing post-pandemic conditions, including rising interest rates and inflationary costs. while we did not see a significant impact on our sources or uses of cash in 2022, future disruptions in the markets could occur which may affect our liquidity position. if our normal operating and investing cash activities were to become insufficient to meet future funding requirements, we believe we have sufficient access to liquidity through our cash position, liquid marketable securities and our $100 million line of credit that does not expire until october 2026. see broader discussions of potential risks to our operations in the operating overview and part i, item 1a. "risk factors" contained within this report.
sources and uses of cash liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of its business operations and growth needs.  our liquidity requirements have been met primarily by funds generated from management fee revenue and income from investments.  cash provided from these sources is used primarily to fund the costs of our management operations including commissions, salaries and wages, pension plans, share repurchases, dividends to shareholders, the purchase and development of information technology, and other capital expenditures.  we expect that our operating cash needs will be met by funds generated from operations. cash in excess of our operating needs is primarily invested in investment grade fixed maturities. as part of our liquidity review, we regularly evaluate our capital needs based on current and projected results and consider the potential impacts to our liquidity, borrowing capacity, financial covenants and capital availability.
we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under various agreements. cash requirements within the next twelve months include accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and other current obligations.
our long-term cash requirements under various contractual obligations and commitments include:
•pension - we have a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and an unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan ("serp") for certain members of executive and senior management. see part ii, item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 9. postretirement benefits, of notes to financial statements" for the funding policy for our defined benefit pension plan and accumulated benefit obligation for our unfunded serp.
•deferred compensation - we have two deferred compensation plans for our executives, senior vice presidents, and other selected officers and two deferred compensation plans for our outside directors. see part ii, item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 10. incentive and deferred compensation plans, of notes to financial statements" for additional details of these obligations and estimated future payments.
•other commitments - we have commitments for approximately $438 million which include agreements for various services, including information technology, support and maintenance obligations, operating leases for equipment, vehicles, and real estate, and other obligations in the ordinary course of business. we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms. these agreements are enforceable and legally binding and specify fixed amounts or minimum quantities to be purchased. some agreements may contain cancellation provisions, some of which may require us to pay a termination fee. over half of these commitments are due in the next 12 months. we are reimbursed from the exchange and its subsidiaries for the portion of these costs related to administrative services.
we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our current and future cash requirements.
volatility in the financial markets presents challenges to us as we occasionally access our investment portfolio as a source of cash.  some of our fixed income investments, despite being publicly traded, may be illiquid.  volatility in these markets could impair our ability to sell certain fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs from sources other than the liquidation of securities.

net cash provided by operating activities was $366.2 million in 2022, compared to $402.8 million in 2021 and $342.6 million in 2020.  decreased cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was primarily due to increases in cash paid for agent commissions of $75.9 million due to higher scheduled commissions driven by premium growth, administrative services expenses paid of $35.0 million and pension contributions of $25.0 million. partially offsetting this decrease in cash provided by operating activities was an increase in management fees received of $118.9 million driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange, compared to 2021. increased cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in management fees received driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange of $94.6 million and an increase in administrative service reimbursements received of $46.9 million. partially offsetting the increase in cash provided by operating activities was an increase in cash paid for agent commissions of $37.4 million due to higher scheduled commission driven by premium growth, an increase in administrative services expenses paid of $33.8 million and an increase in agent bonuses of $15.4 million, compared to 2020.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $106.9 million in 2022, compared to $185.5 million in 2021 and $243.2 million in 2020. in 2022, net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by fixed asset purchases of $67.2 million, which were mostly related to software and home office renovations. additionally, purchases of investments exceeded proceeds generated from sales and maturities/calls of investments. in 2021, net cash used in investing activities was mainly driven by fixed asset purchases of $148.8 million, which included the purchase of the home office from the exchange. to a lesser extent, purchases of investments exceeded proceeds generated from sales and maturities/calls of investments. in 2020, net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by purchases of investments exceeding proceeds generated from sales and maturities/calls of investments.
net cash used in financing activities totaled $300.8 million in 2022, compared to $194.8 million in 2021 and $274.9 million in 2020. the increase in cash used in 2022, compared to 2021, was primarily due to the repayment of the remaining $93.2 million balance on the term loan in 2022. the decrease in cash used in 2021, compared to 2020, was due to a decrease in dividends paid to shareholders of $80.1 million. in addition to the normal quarterly dividends paid in 2020, the board also declared a special one-time cash dividend of $2.00 on each class a share and $300 on each class b share totaling $93.1 million, which was paid in december 2020.
capital outlook we regularly prepare forecasts evaluating the current and future cash requirements for both normal and extreme risk events, including the current post-pandemic economic environment.  should an extreme risk event result in a cash requirement exceeding normal cash flows, we have the ability to meet our future funding requirements through various alternatives available to us.
outside of our normal operating and investing cash activities, future funding requirements could be met through: 1) unpledged cash and cash equivalents, which total approximately $128.8 million at december 31, 2022, 2) $100 million available bank revolving line of credit, and 3) liquidation of unpledged assets held in our investment portfolio, including equity securities and investment grade bonds which totaled approximately $738.3 million at december 31, 2022.  volatility in the financial markets could impair our ability to sell certain fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  additionally, we have the ability to curtail or modify discretionary cash outlays such as those related to shareholder dividends and share repurchase activities.
as of december 31, 2022, we have access to a $100 million bank revolving line of credit with a $25 million letter of credit sublimit that expires on october 29, 2026. as of december 31, 2022, a total of $99.1 million remains available under the facility due to $0.9 million outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the availability for letters of credit to $24.1 million.  we had no borrowings outstanding on our line of credit as of december 31, 2022. investments with a fair value of $114.6 million were pledged as collateral on the line of credit at december 31, 2022. these investments have no trading restrictions and are reported as available-for-sale securities and cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position.  the bank requires compliance with certain covenants, which include leverage ratios and debt restrictions.  we were in compliance with our bank covenants at december 31, 2022.
table of contents enterprise risk management the role of our enterprise risk management ("erm") function is to ensure that all significant risks are clearly identified, understood, proactively managed and consistently monitored to achieve strategic objectives for all stakeholders. our erm program views risk holistically across our entire group of companies. it ensures implementation of risk responses to mitigate potential impacts. see part i, item 1a. "risk factors" contained in this report for a list of risk factors.
our erm process is founded on a governance framework that includes oversight at multiple levels of our organization, including our board of directors and executive management. accountability to identify, manage, and mitigate risk is embedded within all functions and areas of our business. we have defined risk tolerances to monitor and manage significant risks within acceptable levels. in addition to identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, monitoring, and mitigating significant risks, our erm process includes extreme event analyses and scenario testing. given our defined tolerance for risk, risk model output is used to quantify the potential variability of future performance and the sufficiency of capital and liquidity levels.
cybersecurity risk management our board of directors has a process in place to monitor management's oversight of cybersecurity. this is done primarily through regular reports to its risk committee as well as reports to the full board of directors. management reports on our cybersecurity risk management program, including our risk evaluation and the results of independent third-party security assessments, and our efforts to manage cyber related risks.
we employ a company-wide cybersecurity program of technical, administrative and physical controls intended to reduce the risk of cyber threats and protect our information, as well as documented processes to determine and make appropriate disclosures regarding potential material threats and incidents. our cybersecurity philosophy and approach align to the national institute of standards and technology cybersecurity framework and its core elements to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from the various forms of cyber threats. our practices include, but are not limited to, cybersecurity protocols and controls, system monitoring and detection, communication of incidents to appropriate management, third-party risk management, including assessments of emerging threats and vulnerabilities, and ongoing privacy and cybersecurity training for employees and contractors concerning cyber risk. we periodically assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity efforts including independent validation and verification and security assessments conducted by independent third parties.
table of contents transactions/agreements with related parties board oversight our board of directors has a broad oversight responsibility over our intercompany relationships with the exchange.  as a consequence, our board of directors may be required to make decisions or take actions that may not be solely in the interest of our shareholders, such as setting the management fee rate paid by the exchange to us and ratifying any other significant activity.
insurance holding company system most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems, defined as two or more affiliated persons, one or more of which is an insurer. the exchange has the following wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries: erie insurance company, erie insurance company of new york, erie insurance property & casualty company and flagship city insurance company, and a wholly owned life insurance company, erie family life insurance company. indemnity and the exchange, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, meet the definition of an insurance holding company system.
all transactions within a holding company system affecting the member insurers of the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and any charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable.  approval by the applicable insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the members within a holding company system.
intercompany agreements subscriber's and services agreements we serve as attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange, a reciprocal insurance exchange.  each applicant for insurance to a reciprocal insurance exchange signs a subscriber's agreement that contains an appointment of an attorney-in-fact.  through the designation of attorney-in-fact, we are required to provide policy issuance and renewal services and act as the attorney-in-fact for the exchange with respect to all administrative services, as discussed previously.  pursuant to the subscriber's agreement, we earn a management fee for these services calculated as a percentage of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange. by virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the exchange does not have any employees or officers. therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the attorney-in-fact. the exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize indemnity for all administrative services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and indemnity. the subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to indemnity.  reimbursements are settled at cost on a monthly basis. state insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.
shared facilities the exchange and its subsidiaries have a service agreement with indemnity to use space in indemnity-owned properties. see part ii, item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 14. related party, of notes to financial statements" for additional details.
cost allocation the allocation of costs affects our financial condition and that of the exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries. management's role is to determine that allocations are consistently made in accordance with the subscriber's agreement with the subscribers at the exchange, intercompany service agreements, and applicable insurance laws and regulations. allocation of costs under these various agreements requires judgment and interpretation, and such allocations are performed using a consistent methodology, which is intended to adhere to the terms and intentions of the underlying agreements.
intercompany receivables we have significant receivables from the exchange and its affiliates that result in a concentration of credit risk. net receivables from the exchange and other affiliates were $524.9 million, or 23.4% of total assets, at december 31, 2022 and $479.1 million, or 21.4% of total assets, at december 31, 2021. these receivables include management fees due for policy issuance and renewal services performed by us under the subscriber's agreement, and certain costs we incur acting as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the exchange as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries with respect to all administrative services, as discussed previously. these receivables from the exchange and other affiliates are settled monthly. we continually monitor the financial strength of the exchange.

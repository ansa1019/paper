item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction borgwarner inc. and consolidated subsidiaries (the "company" or "borgwarner") is a global product leader in clean and efficient technology solutions for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles. borgwarner's products help improve vehicle performance, propulsion efficiency, stability and air quality. these products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers ("oems") of light vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles ("suvs"), vans and light trucks). the company's products are also sold to other oems of commercial vehicles (medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks and buses) and off-highway vehicles (agricultural and construction machinery and marine applications). the company also manufactures and sells its products to certain tier one vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light, commercial and off-highway vehicles. the company operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in europe, the americas and asia and is an original equipment supplier to nearly every major automotive oem in the world.
charging forward - electrification portfolio strategy in 2021, the company announced its strategy to aggressively grow its electrification product portfolio over time through organic investments and technology-focused acquisitions. the company believes it is well positioned for the industry's anticipated migration to electric vehicles ("ev"). the company is targeting its revenue from products for pure electric vehicles to be over 25% of its total revenue by 2025 and approximately 45% of its total revenue by 2030. the company believes it is on track to exceed its 2025 organic ev-related sales target and over the last two years has announced or completed five acquisitions. on december 6, 2022, the company announced its intention to execute a tax-free spin-off of its fuel systems and aftermarket segments into a separate, publicly traded company. the intended separation of its fuel systems and aftermarket segments would support optimizing the company's combustion portfolio and advancing its electrification journey, while at the same time creating a new, focused company that would be able to pursue growth opportunities in alternative fuels, such as hydrogen, and in aftermarket. the company expects to complete the transaction in late 2023, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions. in 2022, the company's ev-related revenue was approximately $870 million, or 6%, of its total revenue. based on new business awards and actions announced to date, the company believes it is on track to achieve $4.3 billion of ev revenue by 2025.
acquisitions hubei surpass sun electric charging business on september 20, 2022, the company announced that it had entered into an equity transfer agreement under which borgwarner will acquire the electric vehicle solution, smart grid and smart energy businesses of hubei surpass sun electric. the transaction has an enterprise value up to ¥410 million ($60 million), of which approximately ¥267 million ($39 million) will be delivered at or soon after closing, and up to ¥143 million ($21 million) could be paid in the form of contingent payments over approximately two years following the closing. the acquisition complements the company's existing european and north american charging footprint by adding a presence in china. the transaction is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023.
drivetek ag on december 1, 2022, the company acquired drivetek ag, an engineering and product development company located in switzerland. this acquisition strengthens the company's power electronics capabilities in auxiliary inverters, which it expects to accelerate the growth of the high voltage efan business. the company paid ₣27 million ($29 million) at closing, and up to ₣10 million ($10 million) could be paid in the form of contingent payments over the three years following closing.
rhombus energy solutions on july 29, 2022, the company acquired rhombus energy solutions ("rhombus"), a provider of charging solutions in the north american market. the acquisition complements the company's existing european charging footprint to accelerate organic growth and adds north american regional presence to its charging business. the company paid $131 million at closing, and up to $30 million could be paid in the form of contingent payments over the three years following closing.
santroll automotive components on march 31, 2022, the company acquired santroll automotive components ("santroll"), a carve-out of santroll electric auto's emotor business. the acquisition strengthens the company's vertical integration, scale and portfolio breadth in light vehicle emotors while allowing for increased speed to market. the total final consideration was $192 million, which reflects a reduction of approximately $20 million in the base purchase price since the acquisition closing date resulting from an amendment to the equity transfer agreement and finalization of post-closing adjustments. the consideration includes approximately ¥1.0 billion ($152 million) of base purchase price and ¥0.25 billion ($40 million) of originally estimated earn-out payments. the company paid approximately $157 million of base purchase price in the year ended december 31, 2022 and expects to recapture approximately $5 million of post-closing adjustments through a reduction of the payment of the second earn-out. as of december 31, 2022, the company's estimate of the earn-out payments was approximately $21 million. the net amount of the earn-out payment and post-closing adjustments is recorded in other current liabilities in the company's consolidated balance sheet.
akasol on june 4, 2021, the company completed a voluntary public takeover offer for shares of akasol ag ("akasol"), resulting in ownership of 89% of akasol's outstanding shares. the company paid approximately €648 million ($788 million) to settle the offer. during 2021, the company increased its ownership to 93% through the subsequent purchase of additional shares. on february 10, 2022, the company completed a merger squeeze-out process (the "squeeze out") to obtain the remaining shares, resulting in 100% ownership. the acquisition further strengthens borgwarner's commercial vehicle and industrial electrification capabilities, which positions the company to capitalize on what it believes to be a fast-growing battery module and pack market.

key trends and economic factors covid-19 and supplier disruptions. the impact of covid-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has created significant volatility in the global economy. recent covid-19 outbreaks in certain regions continue to cause intermittent covid-19-related disruptions in the company's supply chain and local manufacturing operations. for a significant portion of the second quarter of 2022, china imposed lock-downs in many cities due to an increase in covid-19 cases in the region, which contributed to a decline in industry production in china during the quarter. the company also continues to face supplier disruptions due to a global semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry. further, actions taken by russia in ukraine have impacted the automotive industry particularly in europe, including the company's suppliers, its customers and its operations more generally. in 2022, the company wound down its aftermarket operation in russia, which involved purchasing the noncontrolling interest of a joint venture. the russia operations were not material to the company's financial statements.
commodities and other inflationary impacts. prices for commodities remain volatile, and since the beginning of 2021, the company has experienced price increases for base metals (e.g., steel, aluminum and nickel), precious metals (e.g., palladium), and raw materials that are primarily used in batteries for electric vehicles (e.g., lithium and cobalt). in addition, many global economies, including the united states, are experiencing elevated levels of inflation more generally, which is driving an increase in other input costs. as a result, the company has experienced, and is continuing to experience, higher costs.
in 2022, following non-contractual negotiations, the company reached agreement for the pass through and recovery of higher costs with various customers. these agreements did not enable the company to recover 100 percent of its increased costs, and as a result, the company's operating margins were negatively impacted.
foreign currency impacts. the rapid strengthening of the u.s. dollar in 2022 relative to major foreign currencies, including the euro, korean won and chinese renminbi, and related translation of these currencies to the u.s. dollar, unfavorably impacted the company's net sales, earnings and cash flows. continued significant fluctuations of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar may further negatively impact the company's financial results.
outlook the company expects global industry production to be flat to a modest increase year over year in 2023. the company also expects net new business-related sales growth, due to the increased penetration of borgwarner products and increasing electric vehicle revenue, to drive a sales increase in excess of the growth in industry production outlook. as a result, the company expects increased revenue in 2023, excluding the impact of foreign currencies. the company expects the earnings benefit of this revenue growth to be partially offset by a planned increase in electrification-related research & development ("r&d") expenditures during 2023. this planned r&d increase is to support growth in the company's electric vehicle-related products and is primarily related to supporting the launch of recently awarded programs.
the company maintains a positive long-term outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic investments to enhance its product leadership strategy. there are several trends that are driving the company's long-term growth that management expects to continue, including adoption of product offerings for electrified vehicles and increasingly stringent global emissions standards that support demand for the company's products driving vehicle efficiency.

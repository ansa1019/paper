item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview management believes the following sections provide an overview of several of the most relevant matters necessary for an understanding of the financial aspects of regions's business, particularly regarding its 2022 results. cross references to more detailed information regarding each topic within md&a and the consolidated financial statements are included. this summary is intended to assist in understanding the information provided, but should be read in conjunction with the entire md&a and consolidated financial statements, as well as the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k.
economic environment in regions' banking markets one of the primary factors influencing the credit performance of regions' loan portfolio is the overall economic environment in the u.s. and the primary markets in which it operates. after full-year 2022 real gdp growth of 2.1 percent, the january 2023 baseline forecast anticipates real gdp growth of 1.1 percent in 2023 and 1.5 percent in 2024. as 2022 came to a close, many of the distortions stemming from the pandemic and the policy response to it that had impacted the economy for the prior two years were fading while interest-sensitive sectors of the economy were impacted by the effects of significant increases in market interest rates in 2022. regions continues to expect that by late-2024 the economy will be back on the path of growth around 2.0 percent that prevailed prior to the pandemic. as has been the case since the onset of the pandemic, however, there remains a heightened degree of uncertainty around current economic forecasts.
many businesses across a broad range of industry groups are struggling to ascertain the level of underlying demand as 2023 begins. firms who produce goods or provide services to consumers saw robust growth in demand from the second half of 2020 through much of 2022, reflecting in part financial transfers as part of the policy response to the pandemic and in part by a faster pace of wage growth. consumer demand for goods began to waver over the second half of 2022, and while faster growth in consumer spending on services took up that slack, services spending is expected to slow in 2023.
firms who produce goods or provide services to firms saw robust growth in demand from late-2020 through much of 2022, which was mainly a reflection of two factors. first, firms rushed to fill in the gaps left by production having been disrupted by the effects of the pandemic on the labor market, supply chains, and shipping networks. second, firms built up inventories to levels higher than were considered normal prior to the pandemic, as a hedge against further supply chain/labor supply disruptions. much of that catch-up or precautionary demand began to wane in late-2022 with order backlogs having been worked down and inventories having been built up.
with the robust growth in demand seen over much of the past two years having subsided, firms are left trying to gauge underlying demand and, in turn, appropriate levels of staffing and capital spending. in areas such as retail trade, warehousing/distribution, and technology, many firms were not anticipating a drop-off in demand and are now adjusting to lower than anticipated demand by laying off workers and decreasing capital budgets. other firms are reassessing planned levels of staffing and capital outlays.
subsiding demand is likely to be an ongoing challenge through much of 2023, as a period of elevated inflation and rising interest rates has had an impact on the demand side of the economy and on consumer and business confidence. while supply chain stresses have eased considerably, they have not yet fully cleared, but with the demand side of the economy easing, any lingering supply chain stresses are not as disruptive to businesses as has been the case over the past two years. one sector still being impacted is residential construction, with many builders still having difficulty sourcing building materials. while higher mortgage interest rates contributed to steep declines in home sales, builders were still sitting on sizable backlogs of unfilled orders and units in various phases of construction. this has put a floor under demand for construction materials and supplies, thus helping sustain supply-side stresses.
with a slower pace of growth in consumer spending, businesses scaling down planned growth in capital expenditures, and growth in residential construction remaining weighed down by higher mortgage interest rates, the overall pace of economic activity in 2023 is expected to be considerably slower than the pace seen over the second half of 2022. this will be accompanied by a marked slowdown in the pace of job growth, which will likely fall below the pace required to keep the jobless rate steady.
the pace of job growth slowed steadily over the second half of 2022 but remained more than sufficient to keep the unemployment rate from rising. moreover, there were over ten million open jobs across the u.s. economy as 2022 came to a close. given the well below-trend pace of real gdp growth anticipated over the next several quarters, regions expects the demand for labor to decline, but there is uncertainty in how that will manifest itself. regions expects a meaningfully slower pace of job growth coupled with a significant decline in job vacancies, with firms also resorting to reducing hours worked by current workers as a lever with which to manage total labor input. regions believes that, given how hard and costly it has been for firms to attract and retain labor, firms will be unlikely to lay workers off in large numbers. while there were several high-profile announcements of layoffs as 2022 came to a close, the collective number of layoffs was a minute share of total nonfarm employment, and those workers losing jobs were able to find new positions relatively quickly. the rate of layoffs and discharges, measured as a share of total nonfarm employment, was still below pre-pandemic norms at year-end 2022. that table of contents regions expects the unemployment rate to rise over coming quarters is more a reflection of diminished hiring than of widespread layoffs. as labor demand becomes more closely aligned with labor supply, growth in hourly wages and in total labor compensation costs will slow.
as measured by the cpi, inflation rose to 8.0 percent in 2022, the highest annual rate since 1981, with an intra-year peak rate of 9.1 percent. inflation did decelerate over the second half of the year, in part due to what by year-end 2022 were falling prices for core consumer goods (consumer goods excluding food and energy). services price inflation proved to be more persistent, but there were signs that it too was decelerating by year-end 2022. while the company expects inflation to decelerate further over the course of 2023, it also expects it to end the year above the fomc's 2.0 percent target rate. the fomc, however, does not yet feel confident that inflation is on a one-way track lower and, to that point, as china's economy comes back online in 2023 there could be a new round of upward pressure on energy and commodity prices. that would in turn push headline inflation higher but, even should that prove to be the case, regions looks for core inflation to decelerate. regions expects 25-basis point increases in the fed funds rate at the first two fomc meetings of 2023, after which the expectation is for the fomc to remain on hold. at present regions does not expect the fomc to cut the fed funds rate in 2023. at the same time, the fomc will continue to let the fed balance sheet wind down as maturing assets are allowed to run off the balance sheet.
a number of states within the footprint have seen heightened flows of domestic in-migration since the onset of the pandemic, which has resulted in more rapid rates of job growth and more rapid growth in housing costs. it is likely that migration patterns will shift in 2023 as the broader economy and the labor market slow. that regions' footprint has an above-average exposure to manufacturing means it could feel the contraction in the manufacturing sector more acutely, but the larger, more industrially diverse areas of the footprint are expected to continue to outperform.
the continued economic uncertainty, as described above, impacted regions' forecast utilized in calculating the acl as of december 31, 2022. see the "allowance" section for further information.
2022 results regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $2.1 billion or $2.28 per diluted share in 2022 compared to net income available to common shareholders of $2.4 billion or $2.49 per diluted share in 2021.
net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $4.8 billion in 2022 compared to $4.0 billion in 2021. the net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.36 percent in 2022, reflecting a 51 basis point increase from 2021. the increase in net interest income was primarily driven by an increase in market interest rates, average loan growth, which includes consumer home improvement loans from the fourth quarter 2021 acquisition of enerbank, and a larger average securities portfolio. modest increases in interest expense on deposits and long-term borrowings partially offset the increase in interest income. the increase in net interest margin was primarily driven by higher market interest rates and the addition of higher-yielding consumer home improvement loans from the acquisition of enerbank in the fourth quarter of 2021.
the provision for credit losses totaled $271 million in 2022 compared to a benefit from credit losses of $524 million in 2021. the provision for credit losses was higher than net charge-offs by $8 million in 2022. the increase in the provision for credit losses was driven primarily by economic conditions, normalizing asset quality, and loan growth. refer to the "allowance for credit losses" section of management's discussion and analysis for further detail.
non-interest income was $2.4 billion in 2022 compared to $2.5 billion in 2021. the decrease was primarily driven by lower mortgage income and unfavorable market valuation adjustments on employee benefit assets. non-interest income also includes insurance proceeds related to a settlement reached with the cfpb during the third quarter of 2022. see table 4 "non-interest income" for further details.
non-interest expense was $4.1 billion in 2022 and $3.7 billion in 2021. the increase was driven by several expense categories, primarily salaries and employee benefits expense and professional, legal and regulatory expenses. the increase in professional, legal and regulatory expenses is related to the settlement with the cfpb discussed previously. these increases were partially offset by a loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2021. see table 5 "non-interest expense" for further details.
regions' effective tax rate was 22.0 percent in 2022 compared to 21.6 percent in 2021. see the "income taxes" section for further details.

•note 12 "regulatory capital requirements and restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements loan portfolio and credit during 2022, total loans increased by $9.2 billion or 10.5 percent compared to 2021. the increase was primarily driven by an increase in the commercial portfolio of $7.0 billion, demonstrating significant growth through new loan production and an increase in line utilization. also contributing to the increase was growth in the investor real estate and consumer portfolios of $1.4 billion and $876 million, respectively. the economy has been and will continue to be the primary factor which influences regions' loan portfolio. refer to the "portfolio characteristics" section for further discussion.
net charge-offs totaled $263 million, or 0.29 percent of average loans, in 2022, compared to $204 million, or 0.24 percent in 2021, reflecting increased net charge-offs in the other consumer loan portfolio driven by the sale of unsecured consumer loans at the end of the third quarter of 2022 and a full year of enerbank charge-offs. partially offsetting the increase were declines in the commercial and industrial and investor real estate mortgage charge-offs. the allowance was 1.63 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at december 31, 2022, a decrease from 1.79 percent at december 31, 2021. the coverage ratio of allowance to non-performing loans excluding held for sale was 317 percent at december 31, 2022, compared to 349 percent at december 31, 2021.

at december 31, 2022, the company's borrowing capacity with the federal reserve was $13.2 billion based on available collateral. borrowing availability with the fhlb was $14.5 billion based on available collateral at the same date. regions also maintains a shelf registration statement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission that can be utilized by the company to issue various debt and/or equity securities. additionally, regions' board has authorized regions bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time.
regions is required to conduct liquidity stress testing and measure its available sources of liquidity against minimums as established by regions' internal liquidity policy. regions was fully compliant with those requirements as of year-end.

general the following discussion and financial information is presented to aid in understanding regions' financial position and results of operations. the emphasis of this discussion will be on operations for the years 2022 and 2021; in addition, financial information for prior years will also be presented when appropriate.
regions' profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well as non-interest income sources. net interest income is primarily the difference between the interest income regions receives on interest-earning assets, such as loans, leases, investment securities and cash balances held at the frb, and the interest expense regions pays on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. regions' net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities. non-interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts, card and atm fees, mortgage servicing and secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital markets and other customer services which regions provides. results of operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, equipment and software expenses, occupancy, professional, legal and regulatory expenses, fdic insurance assessments, and other operating expenses, as well as income taxes.
table of contents economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government significantly affect most, if not all, financial institutions, including regions. lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in regions' market areas.
regions' business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile banking.
recent acquisitions on december 17, 2021, regions entered into an agreement to acquire clearsight advisors, inc., a leading-edge mergers and acquisitions firm headquartered in mclean, virginia. the transaction closed on december 31, 2021.
on october 4, 2021, regions entered into an agreement to acquire sabal capital partners, llc, a diversified financial services firm that facilitates lending in the small-balance commercial real estate market headquartered in irvine, california. the transaction closed on december 1, 2021. refer to the "sabal acquisition" section for more detail.
on june 8, 2021, regions entered into an agreement to acquire enerbank, a consumer lending institution specializing in home improvement lending headquartered in salt lake city, utah. the transaction closed on october 1, 2021, and resulted in the addition of approximately $3.1 billion in loans to consumers. refer to the "enerbank acquisition" section for more detail.
business segments regions provides traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, and other specialty financing. regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three reportable segments: corporate bank, consumer bank, and wealth management, with the remainder in other.
see note 22 "business segment information" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on regions' business segments.
non-gaap measures the table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial measures, which excludes certain adjustments that are included in the financial results presented in accordance with gaap. these non-gaap financial measures include "adjusted net loan charge-offs", "adjusted net loan charge-offs as a percent of average loans, annualized", "adjusted non-interest expense", "adjusted non-interest income", "adjusted total revenue", "adjusted total revenue, taxable-equivalent basis", and "adjusted operating leverage ratio". regions believes that excluding certain items provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparison, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the company and predicting future performance. these non-gaap financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of regions' business because management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. regions believes that presentation of these non-gaap financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management. management and the board utilize these non-gaap financial measures as follows:
•preparation of regions' operating budgets
•monthly financial performance reporting
•monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results
•presentations to investors of company performance
•metrics for incentive compensation net loan charge-offs (gaap) are presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted net loan-charge offs (non-gaap). adjusted net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans (non-gaap) are calculated as adjusted net loan charge-offs (non-gaap) divided by average loans (gaap) and annualized. non-interest expense (gaap) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-gaap). net interest income (gaap) is presented with taxable-equivalent adjustments to arrive at net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis (gaap). non-interest income (gaap) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-gaap). net interest income (gaap) and adjusted non-interest income (non-gaap) are added together to arrive at adjusted total revenue (non-gaap). net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis (gaap) and adjusted non-interest income (non-gaap) are added together to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-gaap). the adjusted operating leverage ratio (non-gaap), which is a measure of productivity, is calculated as the year over year percentage change in adjusted total revenue on a taxable-
table of contents equivalent basis (non-gaap) less the year over year percentage change in adjusted total non-interest expense (non-gaap). management uses this ratio to monitor performance and believes it provides meaningful information to investors.
non-gaap financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. although these non-gaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap. in particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to shareholders.
the following table provides: 1) a reconciliation of net loan charge-offs (gaap) to adjusted net loan charge-offs (non-gaap), 2) a computation of adjusted net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans, annualized (non-gaap), 3) a reconciliation of non-interest expense (gaap) to adjusted non-interest expense (non-gaap), 4) a reconciliation of non-interest income (gaap) to adjusted non-interest income (non-gaap), 5) a computation of adjusted total revenue (non-gaap), 6) a computation of adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-gaap) and 7) presentation of the operating leverage ratio (gaap) and the adjusted operating leverage ratio (non-gaap).

critical accounting estimates and related policies in preparing financial information, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses for the periods shown. the accounting principles followed by regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with gaap, regulatory guidance, where applicable, and general banking practices. estimates and assumptions most significant to regions are related primarily to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurements, intangible assets (goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets), residential msrs and income taxes, and are summarized in the following discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses ("allowance") consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. regions determines its allowance in accordance with gaap and applicable regulatory guidance.
see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 5 "allowance for credit losses" to the consolidated financial statements for information about areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the allowance.
the allowance is sensitive to a number of internal factors, such as modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. the allowance is also sensitive to external factors such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by changes in interest rates, inflation, gdp, unemployment rates, changes in real table of contents estate demand and values, volatility in commodity prices, bankruptcy filings, health pandemics, government stimulus, and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes.
management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance. these variables and others have the ability to result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts.
changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods. in addition, bank regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, may require changes in the level of allowance based on their judgments and estimates. volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected. additionally, changes in circumstances related to individually large credits, commodity prices, or certain macroeconomic forecast assumptions may result in volatility. the scenarios discussed below, or other scenarios, have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ, perhaps materially, from the originally estimated amounts. this analysis is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect uncertainty and imprecision based on then-current circumstances and conditions.
in june 2022, the frb released its estimated modeled credit losses for regions based on the december 31, 2021 balance sheet. the frb estimated credit losses in its severely adverse scenario of $6.0 billion, or 6.9 percent. see the federal reserve stress test disclosures at "item 1. business - capital requirements" for more information regarding their assumptions in this stress test.
it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in the allowance estimate. changes in the factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. however, to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate economic forecast, regions estimated the allowance using a scenario that was 1 standard deviation unfavorable to the expected scenario for each macroeconomic variable. this unfavorable scenario resulted in an allowance approximately 16 percent higher than the allowance using the expected scenario.
similar to the scenarios above, it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in credit risk factors might affect the overall allowance because of the wide variety of credit risk factors that are considered in estimating the allowance. changes in risk ratings may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across product or industry types. regions conducted a separate sensitivity analysis considering deteriorating conditions for commercial and investor real estate portfolio factors by stressing key portfolio drivers relative to the baseline portfolio conditions. regions stressed risk ratings by one downgrade for commercial and investor real estate loans. this scenario generated an increase in the modeled allowance of approximately $144 million for the commercial and investor real estate portfolios.
fair value measurements a portion of the company's assets and liabilities is carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded either in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). these include debt securities available for sale, mortgage loans held for sale, equity investments (with and without readily determinable market values), residential msrs and derivative assets and liabilities. from time to time, the estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale, which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. fair value determination is also relevant for certain other assets such as foreclosed property and other real estate, which are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan/property or fair value, less estimated costs to sell the property. for example, the fair value of other real estate is determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information, less estimated selling costs. adjustments to the appraised value are made if management becomes aware of changes in the fair value of specific properties or property types. the determination of fair value also impacts certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates, including goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.
fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability (an entry price), in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to "normal" market activity, management's objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a third-party investor under current market conditions. the value to the company if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates.
a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance. fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs the company utilizes. fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (level 1 valuations). if market table of contents prices are not available, quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used (level 2 valuations). where observable market data is not available, the valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on company-specific data (level 3 valuations). these unobservable assumptions reflect the company's own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. valuation techniques typically include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability.
see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value, including pricing validation processes.
intangible assets regions' intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses ("goodwill") and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily relationship assets, agency commercial real estate licenses and purchased credit card relationships). goodwill totaled $5.7 billion at both december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021. goodwill is allocated to each of regions' reportable segments (each a reporting unit: corporate bank, consumer bank, and wealth management). goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1 or more often if events and circumstances indicate impairment may exist (refer to note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion).
accounting guidance permits the company to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. if, based on the weight of the evidence, the company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds book value, then an impairment test is not necessary. if the company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, or concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment test is performed. the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. to the extent that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, impairment is not indicated. conversely, if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying amount, a loss (which could be material) would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the estimated fair value. the carrying value of equity for each reporting unit is determined from an allocation based upon risk weighted assets. adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations of the reporting unit, or other factors could result in a decline in the estimated implied fair value of goodwill.
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1, 2022, by performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level to determine whether any indicators of impairment existed. in performing the qualitative assessment, the company evaluated events and circumstances since the last impairment analysis, recent operating performance including reporting unit performance, changes in market capitalization, regulatory actions and assessments, changes in the business climate, company-specific factors, and trends in the banking industry. after assessing the totality of the events and circumstances, the company determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the corporate bank, consumer bank, and wealth management reporting units exceed their respective carrying values. therefore, a quantitative impairment test was deemed unnecessary. refer to note 9 "intangible assets" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill.
specific factors as of the date of filing the financial statements that could negatively impact the assumptions used in assessing goodwill for impairment include: a protracted decline in the company's market capitalization; adverse business trends resulting from litigation and/or regulatory actions; higher loan losses; forecasts of high unemployment levels; future increased minimum regulatory capital requirements above current thresholds (refer to note 12 "regulatory capital requirements and restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of current minimum regulatory requirements); future federal rules and regulations (e.g., such as those resulting from the dodd-frank act); and/or a significant protraction in the current level of interest rates.
other identifiable intangible assets such as relationship assets, agency commercial real estate licenses and purchased credit card relationships, are reviewed at least annually (usually in the fourth quarter) for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset. these events could include loss of customer relationships, significant losses of credit card accounts and/or balances, increased competition or adverse changes in the economy. to the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount. these events or circumstances, if they occur, could be material to regions' operating results for any particular reporting period but the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated. as of december 31, 2022, the company's review indicated there was no impairment in the value of the intangible assets.
residential mortgage servicing rights regions has elected to measure and report its residential msrs using the fair value method. although sales of residential msrs do occur, residential msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices and the exact terms table of contents and conditions of sales may not be readily available, and are therefore level 3 valuations in the fair value hierarchy previously discussed in the "fair value measurements" section. specific characteristics of the underlying loans greatly impact the estimated value of the related residential msrs. as a result, regions stratifies its residential mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics, including loan type and contractual note rate, and values its residential msrs using discounted cash flow modeling techniques. these techniques require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration historical and forecasted residential mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, escrow balances and servicing costs. changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other factors impact the fair value of residential msrs which impacts earnings. the carrying value of residential msrs was $812 million at december 31, 2022. based on a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, regions estimates that a reduction in benchmark interest rates of 25 basis points and 50 basis points would reduce the december 31, 2022 fair value of residential msrs by approximately 1 percent ($10 million) and 3 percent ($22 million), respectively. conversely, 25 basis point and 50 basis point increases in these rates would increase the december 31, 2022 fair value of residential msrs by approximately 1 percent ($9 million) and 2 percent ($17 million), respectively. regions also estimates that an increase in servicing costs of approximately $10 per loan, or 16 percent, would result in a decline in the value of the residential msrs by approximately $26 million.
the pro forma fair value analyses presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of fair values to hypothetical changes in primary mortgage rates and servicing costs. this sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome. refer to note 6 "servicing of financial assets" to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on residential mortgage servicing rights.
income taxes accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect management's estimate of income taxes to be paid or received. the company is subject to income tax in the u.s. and multiple state and local jurisdictions. the tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction are complex and may be subject to different interpretations by the company and the relevant government taxing authorities. therefore, the company is required to exercise judgment in determining tax accruals and evaluating the company's tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions.
deferred income taxes represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or received and are accounted for using the asset and liability method with the net balance reported in other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets. the company determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering all positive and negative evidence available, including the impact of recent operating results, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies. in projecting future taxable income, the company utilizes forecasted pre-tax earnings, adjusts for the estimated temporary differences and incorporates assumptions, including the amounts of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions. determining whether deferred tax assets are realizable is subjective and requires the use of significant judgment. a valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the company currently maintains a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards.
the company's estimate of accrued income taxes, deferred income taxes and income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions, as well as changes in income tax rates and changes in operating activities. any changes, if they occur, can be significant to the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 19 "income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements for further details and discussion.
operating results net interest income and net interest margin net interest income is regions' principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of regions' ability to meet its overall performance goals. both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by market interest rates and in 2022, the fomc increased the fed funds rate by 425 basis points during the twelve months ended december 31, 2022.
net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) increased by $875 million in 2022 compared to 2021, and net interest margin increased by 51 basis points to 3.36 percent in 2022. the increases in net interest income and net interest margin were driven primarily by higher interest rates and the addition of higher-yielding consumer home improvement loans from the acquisition of enerbank in the fourth quarter of 2021. growth in average loan and average securities portfolio balances also contributed to the increase in net interest income. a decline in average cash balances, as a result of loan growth and a decline in deposits due to normalizing pandemic liquidity, also contributed to the increase in net interest margin. increases in average interest-bearing deposit balances and costs partially offset the increases in net interest income and net interest margin, and a decline in ppp forgiveness income in 2022 also impacted net interest income.
table of contents regions' asset yields in 2022 were impacted by the high interest rate environment. the loan portfolio yield increased to 4.46 percent in 2022 from 4.11 percent in 2021. the company's loan yields are primarily influenced by short-term interest rates such as 30-day libor, which averaged 1.92 percent in 2022 compared to 0.10 percent in 2021. the increase in loan yields includes the transfer from higher cash-flow hedge income in 2021 to higher loan product yields in 2022, and is also attributable to the rise in short-term rates. additionally, fixed-rate lending production and investment securities portfolio reinvestment, which contains significant residential fixed-rate exposure, benefited from higher long-term rates. the investment securities portfolio increased in yield to 2.20 percent in 2022 from 1.86 percent in 2021.
funding costs remained well-controlled, but increased in 2022 to 0.23 percent compared to 0.12 percent in 2021. deposit costs increased to 14 basis points for 2022 compared to 5 basis points for 2021 due primarily to higher interest rates coupled with a higher interest-bearing balance mix.

(1)amounts have been calculated using whole dollar values.
(2)debt securities are included on an amortized cost basis with yield and net interest margin calculated accordingly.

(3)interest income on debt securities includes hedging income of $41 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 and zero for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020. hedging income for the year ended december 31, 2022 reflects strategies designed to accelerate hedge notional maturities through the use of pay fixed swaps. benefits will migrate to cash flow hedges from loans in the first quarter of 2023.
(4)loans, net of unearned income include non-accrual loans for all periods presented.
(5)interest income on loans, net of unearned income, includes hedging income of $140 million, $426 million, and $260 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. interest income on loans, net of unearned income, also includes net loan fees of $64 million, $152 million and $75 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(6)total deposit costs may be calculated by dividing total interest expense on deposits by the sum of interest-bearing deposits and non-interest-bearing deposits. the rates for total deposit costs equal 0.14%, 0.05% and 0.16% for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(7)the computation of taxable-equivalent net interest income is based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit.

notes:
•the change in interest not due solely to volume or yield/rate has been allocated to the volume column and yield/rate column in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.
•the computation of taxable-equivalent net interest income is based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit.
the mix of earning assets can affect the interest rate spread. regions' primary types of earning assets are loans and investment securities. certain types of earning assets have historically generated larger spreads; for example, loans typically generate larger spreads than other assets, such as securities or interest bearing deposits in other banks. average earning assets in 2022 totaled $144.0 billion, an increase of $5.3 billion as compared to the prior year, primarily due to increases in loans, net of unearned income, and securities. these increases were partially offset by a decline in cash balances as a result of loan growth and deposit declines due to normalizing pandemic liquidity. see the "loans", "debt securities", and "cash and cash equivalents" sections for further details.
average loans as a percentage of average earning assets were 64 percent and 61 percent in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the remaining categories of earning assets are shown in table 2 "consolidated average daily balances and yield/rate analysis". the proportion of average earning assets to average total assets, which was 90 percent in both 2022 and 2021, measures the effectiveness of management's efforts to invest available funds into the most profitable earning vehicles. funding for regions' earning assets comes from interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing sources. another significant factor affecting the net interest margin is the percentage of earning assets funded by interest-bearing liabilities. the percentage of average earning assets funded by average interest-bearing liabilities was 57 percent in 2022 and 56 percent in 2021.
table of contents provision for (benefit from) credit losses the provision for (benefit from) credit losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a level that in management's judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio at the balance sheet date. during 2022, the provision for credit losses totaled $271 million and net charge-offs were $263 million. this compares to a benefit from credit losses of $524 million and net charge-offs of $204 million in 2021.
for further discussion and analysis of the total allowance for credit losses, see the "allowance for credit losses" and "risk management" sections found later in this report. see also note 5 "allowance for credit losses" to the consolidated financial statements.

(2) the 2021 amount is a gain on the sale of an equity investment, whereas the 2020 amount is a valuation gain on the investment that was sold in the first quarter 2021.
service charges on deposit accounts service charges on deposit accounts include overdraft fees, corporate analysis service charges, non-sufficient fund fees, and other customer transaction-related service charges. during the current year, service charges have been impacted by overdraft-related policy enhancements throughout 2022 and the elimination of non-sufficient fund fees in mid-june 2022.
capital markets income capital markets income primarily relates to capital raising activities that include securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. capital markets income increased slightly in 2022, driven primarily by higher commercial swap income, which benefited from positive credit/ debit valuation adjustments due to rate and spread movements. additionally, capital markets income includes revenue from the fourth quarter 2021 acquisitions of sabal and clearsight. offsetting these increases were declines in securities underwriting and placement fees and m&a advisory fees. m&a advisory fees were impacted by timing delays due to market volatility during 2022.
mortgage income mortgage income is generated through the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. the decrease in mortgage income in 2022 was due primarily to lower mortgage production and sales as a result of higher market interest rates. the decline in production and sales was partially offset by an increase in servicing income and improvement in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedges. mortgage income for 2022 also includes approximately $12 million in gains associated with the re-securitization and sale of ginnie mae loans previously repurchased from their pools in the first quarter of 2022.
investment services fee income investment services fee income represents income earned from investment advisory services. investment services fee income increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to the rising interest rate environment, which has driven table of contents increases in fixed annuity rates and the related investment income. also contributing was an increase in assets under management due to an increase in financial advisors.
bank-owned life insurance bank-owned life insurance income primarily represents income earned from the appreciation of the cash surrender value of insurance contracts held and the proceeds of insurance benefits. bank-owned life insurance decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to an $18 million individual boli claim benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2021.
market value adjustments on employee benefit assets market value adjustments on employee benefit assets are the reflection of market value variations related to assets held for certain employee benefits. market value adjustments on employee benefit assets decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 due to market volatility. the adjustments are offset in salaries and benefits and other non-interest expense.

insurance proceeds insurance proceeds recognized in 2022 were related to the settlement of a previously disclosed matter with the cfpb. see note 23 "commitments, contingencies and guarantees" for more detail.
other miscellaneous income other miscellaneous income includes net revenue from affordable housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments (other than the item listed separately in table 4 above), fees from safe deposit boxes, check fees and other miscellaneous income. net revenue from affordable housing includes actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of affordable housing investments, cash distributions from the investments and any related impairment charges. other miscellaneous income decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a decline in commercial loan and leasing related fee income, a decrease in sbic income, and adjustments made in 2021 to increase the values of other equity investments.

salaries and employee benefits salaries and employee benefits consist of salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee benefit purposes. salaries and employee benefits increased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a full year of expense related to the additional associates from acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2021. there was also growth in full-time equivalent headcount during the year from 19,626 at december 31, 2021 to 20,073 at december 31, 2022. also contributing to the increase were annual merit increases that occurred in the second quarter of 2022. these increases were partially offset by a decline in benefits expense.
table of contents professional, legal and regulatory expenses professional, legal and regulatory expenses consist of amounts related to legal, consulting, other professional fees and regulatory charges. professional, legal and regulatory expenses increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a settlement reached with the cfpb in the third quarter of 2022 related to a previously disclosed matter. see note 23 "commitments, contingencies and guarantees" for more detail.
fdic insurance assessments fdic insurance assessments increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due to higher fdic premium expenses as a result of loan growth and declining cash balances.
loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2021, regions redeemed its 3.80% senior bank notes and incurred related early extinguishment pre-tax charges totaling $20 million.
income taxes the company's income tax expense for the year ended 2022 was $631 million compared to income tax expense of $694 million for the same period in 2021, resulting in effective tax rates of 22.0% percent and 21.6% percent, respectively. see the "executive overview" for the company's near-term expectations for future tax rates.
the effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions with differing tax rates, enacted tax legislation, net tax benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance income, tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. in addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain leveraged leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and changes to unrecognized tax benefits. accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted.
see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 19 "income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes.
balance sheet analysis the following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in certain line items in asset, liability, and shareholders' equity categories.
cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents totaled $11.2 billion compared to $29.4 billion at december 31, 2021. the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in cash on deposit with the frb partially offset by an increase in cash due from other banks. in 2022, the company used cash balances to fund loan growth and experienced a decline in deposits. also contributing to the decline in cash balances was securities purchases as a part of hedging and active cash management strategies. see the "debt securities", "loans", "liquidity", and "deposits" sections for more information.
debt securities debt securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the company. regions maintains a highly rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency mortgage-backed securities. regions' investment policy emphasizes credit quality and liquidity. debt securities rated in the highest category by nationally recognized rating agencies and debt securities backed by the u.s. government and government sponsored agencies, both on a direct and indirect basis, represented approximately 96 percent of the investment portfolio at december 31, 2022. all other debt securities rated below aaa, not backed by the u.s. government or government sponsored agencies, or which are not rated represented approximately 4 percent of total debt securities at december 31, 2022. the "market risk-interest rate risk" and "liquidity risk" sections, found later in this report, further explain regions' interest rate and liquidity risk management practices.
the average life of the debt securities portfolio at december 31, 2022 was estimated to be 5.77 years, with a duration of approximately 4.81 years. these metrics compare with an estimated average life of 4.93 years and a duration of approximately 4.25 years for the portfolio at december 31, 2021.
the decrease in debt securities from year-end 2021 was primarily driven by declines in market valuations due to an increase in market interest rates. regions made purchases of debt securities available for sale, in addition to normal reinvestment of maturities and paydowns, totaling approximately $2.8 billion consisting primarily of u.s. treasury, federal agency, residential agency mortgage, and commercial agency mortgage-backed securities in 2022, which partially offset the market value declines. approximately $2.5 billion of the purchases relate to the company's hedging strategy with the remaining purchases related to reinvestment of proceeds from loan sales.

(1)"real estate" includes reits, which are unsecured commercial and industrial products that are real estate related.
(2)"other" contains balances related to non-classifiable and invalid business industry codes offset by payments in process and fee accounts that are not available at the loan level.
(3)as customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing chain), regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to define the customer relationship. when these changes occur, regions does not recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed appropriate. as a result, year over year changes may be impacted.
table of contents investor real estate loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. this portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral. a portion of regions' investor real estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within regions' markets. additionally, this category includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. total investor real estate loans increased $1.4 billion in comparison to 2021 year-end balances. the increase was primarily driven by growth in term lending commitments and fundings on previously committed construction facilities.
residential first mortgage residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. these loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. these loans increased $1.3 billion in comparison to 2021 year-end balances. the increase is primarily due to a decline in prepayment rate and an increase in arm production retained on the balance sheet. the increase was partially offset by the sale of approximately $285 million of ginnie mae loans in the first quarter of 2022, which had been previously repurchased from their pools. approximately $4.0 billion in new loan originations were retained on the balance sheet through the year ended december 31, 2022.
home equity lines home equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. home equity lines decreased $234 million in comparison to 2021 year-end balances, as payoffs and paydowns continue to outpace production. substantially all of this portfolio was originated through regions' branch network.
beginning in december 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment term. during the 10-year draw period customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very limited basis. from may 2009 to december 2016, home equity lines of credit had a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. prior to may 2009, the predominant structure was a 20-year draw period with a balloon payment upon maturity. the term "balloon payment" means there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of credit.
the following table presents information regarding the future principal payment reset dates for the company's home equity lines of credit as of december 31, 2022. the balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a repayment period.

consumer credit quality data the company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending products ("current ltv"). the estimate is based on home price indices compiled by a third party. the third party data indicates trends for msas. regions uses the third party valuation trends from the msas in the company's footprint in its estimate. the trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area.
table of contents the following table presents current ltv data for components of the residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment. current ltv data for some loans in the portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. the amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. for purposes of the table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral the entire balance is included in the "above 100%" category, regardless of the amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

consumer credit card consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest rate consumer credit card loans.
other consumer-exit portfolios other consumer-exit portfolios includes lending initiatives through third parties consisting of loans made through automotive dealerships and other point of sale lending. regions ceased originating new loans related to these businesses prior to 2020 and therefore the portfolio balance has decreased $501 million from year-end 2021.
other consumer other consumer loans primarily include indirect and direct consumer loans, overdrafts and other revolving loans. other consumer loans increased $270 million from year-end 2021 primarily driven by by increases in consumer home improvement loans partially offset by the sale of $1.2 billion of unsecured consumer loans at the end of the third quarter of 2022.
regions considers factors such as periodic updates of fico scores, unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for consumer loans. fico scores are obtained at origination and refreshed fico scores are obtained by the company quarterly for most consumer loans. for more information on credit quality indicators refer to note 5 "allowance for credit losses".
allowance the allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. unfunded credit commitments includes items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments.
the allowance totaled $1.6 billion at both of december 31, 2022 and 2021, which represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios. key drivers of the change in the allowance by table of contents quarter from year-end 2021 to year-end 2022 are presented in table 14 below. while many of these items overlap regarding impact, they are included in the category most relevant.

in deriving its december 2022 forecast, regions benchmarked its internal forecast with external forecasts and external data available. regions' december 2022 baseline forecast weakened slightly compared to the september 2022 forecast driven by a slight decline in real gdp growth. the december 2022 baseline forecast continues to anticipate real gdp growth in 2023 supported primarily by consumer spending and business investments in equipment, machinery and intellectual property. while the baseline forecast continues to anticipate a strong hpi, quarter over quarter growth is expected to decelerate in 2023 compared to double-digit levels experienced in recent quarters. as measured by cpi, inflation is expected to remain above the fomc's 2.0 percent target into 2024. furthermore, ongoing disruptions in supply chains and shipping networks, monetary policy tightening, and heightened financial volatility provide significant uncertainty over the near-term forecast. see the "economic environment in regions' banking markets" discussion in the "executive overview" section for additional information.
credit metrics are monitored throughout each quarter in order to understand external macro-views, trends and industry outlooks, as well as regions' internal specific views of credit metrics and trends. in the fourth quarter of 2022, asset quality continued to normalize, as expected, within certain select sectors of the commercial and consumer portfolios. total net charge-offs declined $41 million, but increased $22 million excluding the impact of the consumer loan sale in the third quarter of 2022. commercial and investor real estate criticized balances increased approximately $378 million, which included an increase in classified balances of $254 million compared to the third quarter of 2022. non-performing loans, excluding held for sale, and non-performing assets both increased approximately $5 million compared to the third quarter of 2022. this normalization resulted in a modest increase to the modeled results in the allowance for credit losses.
loan growth in the fourth quarter, much of which was in high quality risk rating categories, also contributed to the increase in the allowance for credit losses modeled results. additionally, the fourth quarter allowance reflects the full release of the $20 million adjustment to the modeled results for hurricane ian established in the third quarter of 2022.
while regions' quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision. the qualitative framework has a general imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in any modeling estimate. the december 31, 2022 general imprecision allowance decreased slightly compared to the third quarter of 2022 and reflects balanced risk in the economic forecast.
based on the overall analysis performed, management deemed an allowance of $1.6 billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan and credit commitment portfolios as of december 31, 2022.

(1)regions adopted accounting guidance on january 1, 2020 and recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting guidance. see note 1 for additional details.
(2)amounts have been calculated using whole dollar values.
net charge-offs increased $59 million year-over-year, primarily driven by an increase in net charge-offs in the other consumer portfolio due to the sale of unsecured consumer loans at the end of the third quarter of 2022. see table 1 "gaap to non-gaap reconciliations" for further details. also contributing to the increase in other consumer net charge offs is $39 million in net charge-offs from the addition of the enerbank portfolio for 2022 compared to $7 million in 2021. partially offsetting the increase in net charge-offs were declines in the commercial and industrial and commercial investor real estate mortgage portfolios. see the "executive overview" section for details on expectations for net charge-offs in 2023.
allocation of the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment and class is summarized as follows:

table of contents troubled debt restructurings (tdrs)
tdrs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. residential first mortgage, home equity, consumer credit card and other consumer tdrs are consumer loans modified under the cap. commercial and investor real estate loan modifications are not the result of a formal program, but represent situations where modifications were offered as a workout alternative. renewals of classified commercial and investor real estate loans are considered to be tdrs, even if no reduction in interest rate is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below market. insignificant modifications are not considered tdrs. more detailed information is included in note 5 "allowance for credit losses" to the consolidated financial statements.
as provided initially in the cares act and subsequently extended through the consolidated appropriations act, certain loan modifications related to the covid-19 pandemic beginning march 1, 2020 through january 1, 2022 were eligible for relief from tdr classification. regions elected this provision of both acts; therefore, modified loans that met the required guidelines for relief were not considered tdrs and are excluded from the december 31, 2021 disclosures below. the following table summarizes the loan balance and related allowance for accruing and non-accruing tdrs for the periods ending december 31:

table of contents the following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and investor real estate tdrs. tdrs with subsequent restructurings that meet the definition of a tdr are only reported as tdr additions in the period they were first modified. other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures, payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, regions may remove loans from tdr classification if the following conditions are met: the borrower's financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, the loan has not been restructured as an "a" note/"b" note, the loan has been reported as a tdr over one fiscal year-end and the loan is subsequently refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new loan.
for the consumer portfolio, changes in tdrs are primarily due to additions from cap modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. given the types of concessions currently being granted under the cap as detailed in note 5 "allowance for credit losses" to the consolidated financial statements, regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition will be widely achieved.

(1)excludes accruing loans 90 days past due.
(2)excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the fha and all guaranteed loans sold to ginnie mae where regions has the right but not the obligation to repurchase. total 90 days or more past due guaranteed loans excluded were $34 million at december 31, 2022 and $49 million at december 31, 2021.
non-performing loans increased during 2022 driven primarily by increases in agriculture, business offices, and professional, scientific and technical services segments which were partially offset by improvements in the energy, restaurant, accommodation, and lodging, and utilities segments. economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity prices, and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-performing assets. circumstances related to individually large credits could also result in volatility.

other earning assets other earning assets consist primarily of investments in frb and fhlb stock, marketable equity securities, and other miscellaneous earning assets. the balance at december 31, 2022 totaled $1.3 billion, increasing from $1.2 billion at december 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in other miscellaneous earning assets. refer to note 7 "other earning assets" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
premises and equipment premises and equipment at december 31, 2022 decreased $96 million to $1.7 billion compared to year-end 2021. this decrease primarily resulted from depreciation expense on existing assets.
goodwill goodwill totaled $5.7 billion at both december 31, 2022 and 2021. refer to the "critical accounting policies" section earlier in this report for detailed discussions of the company's methodology for testing goodwill for impairment. refer to note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 9 "intangible assets" to the consolidated financial statements for the methodologies and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis. additionally, see the "enerbank" and "sabal" sections for details on goodwill recorded as a result of these acquisitions in 2021.
residential mortgage servicing rights at fair value residential msrs increased approximately $394 million from december 31, 2021 to december 31, 2022. the year-over-year increase was primarily due to purchases of residential msrs. also contributing to the increase were valuation adjustments on the msr portfolio due to changes in market interest rates and other inputs including prepayment speeds. an analysis of residential msrs is presented in note 6 "servicing of financial assets" to the consolidated financial statements.
table of contents other assets other assets increased $2.0 billion to $9.0 billion as of december 31, 2022. the increase was primarily due to an increase in deferred income tax assets due to increases in unrealized losses on securities available for sale and derivative instruments. also contributing to the increase were in-process items associated with a program which provides direct-deposit customers access to their qualifying payroll funds up to two days early and creates in-process receivables for certain participating employers' and federal and state government payments.
deposits regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market. regions' ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the company meets customers' needs. regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service, competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking services through the company's digital channels and contact center.
deposits are regions' primary source of funds, providing funding for 95 percent of average earning assets in 2022 and 94 percent of average earning assets in 2021. table 22 "deposits" details year-over-year deposit balance decline on a period-ending basis. total deposits at december 31, 2022 decreased approximately $7.3 billion compared to year-end 2021 levels across most categories.
deposit costs increased to 14 basis points for 2022, compared to 5 basis points for 2021. the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 25 basis points in 2022 compared to 9 basis points for 2021. in 2022, short-term interest rates increased rapidly throughout the year, but despite the increase in interest rates, deposit costs remained controlled. low deposit costs are driven primarily by the composition of the company's deposit base, which includes a significant amount of low-cost and relatively small account balance consumer deposits. the deposit base composition is a key component of the company's franchise value. deposit balances acquired through periods of excess liquidity during 2021 have declined from year-end 2021, as expected. see the "market risk-interest rate risk" section for further discussion of these balances.
the following table summarizes deposits by category as of december 31:

$131,743                      $139,072
non-interest-bearing demand deposits decreased $7.0 billion to $51.3 billion at year-end 2022. non-interest-bearing demand deposits accounted for approximately 39 percent of total deposits at year-end 2022 compared to 42 percent at year-end 2021. interest-bearing checking deposits decreased $2.3 billion to $25.7 billion and accounted for approximately 19 percent and 20 percent of total deposits for 2022 and 2021, respectively. the declines across non-interest bearing demand and interest-bearing checking are primarily due to corporate and wealth management customers continuing to reduce excess balances accumulated over the past two years. additionally, as interest rates have increased corporate customers have remixed into higher-yielding deposit accounts.
savings accounts increased $528 million to $15.7 billion at year-end 2022 and accounted for 12 percent of total deposits at year-end 2022 compared to 11 percent at year-end 2021. money market accounts increased $1.9 billion to $33.3 billion at year-end 2022 and accounted for approximately 25 percent of total deposits at year-end 2022 compared to 23 percent at year-end 2021. the increase in money market balances is primarily due to rate-seeking behavior exhibited by corporate customers as discussed above.
included in time deposits are certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts. time deposits decreased $371 million to $5.8 billion at year-end 2022. the decline in time deposits was driven by a decline in accounts acquired through enerbank as these deposits are not being replaced when they mature. time deposits accounted for 4 percent of total deposits in both 2022 and 2021.
see the "executive overview" section for details on expectations for deposits in 2023.
the amount of estimated uninsured deposits at december 31, 2022 and 2021, totaled $49.3 billion and $56.2 billion, respectively. the estimate of uninsured deposits was based upon methodologies used in the company's call report. time deposit accounts with balances of $250,000 or more totaled $790 million and $571 million at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

in general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of earnings. any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may impact regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, regions' access to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity, collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters of credit, thereby potentially adversely impacting regions' financial condition and liquidity. see the "risk factors" section of this annual report on form 10-k for more information.
table of contents a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.
shareholders' and total equity shareholders' equity was $15.9 billion at december 31, 2022 as compared to $18.3 billion at december 31, 2021. during 2022, net income increased shareholders' equity by $2.2 billion, cash dividends on common stock and cash dividends on preferred stock reduced shareholders' equity by $692 million and $99 million, respectively. changes in aoci decreased shareholders' equity by $3.6 billion, primarily due to the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale and derivative instruments as a result of significant changes in market interest rates during 2022. common stock repurchased during 2022 decreased shareholders' equity $230 million. these shares were immediately retired and therefore are not included in treasury stock.
total equity includes noncontrolling interest of $4 million, representing the unowned portion of a low income housing tax credit fund syndication, of which regions held the majority interest at december 31, 2022.
see note 14 "shareholders' equity and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
regulatory requirements capital rules regions and regions bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by federal and state banking agencies. these regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the company's assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative judgments by the regulators. failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. under the basel iii rules, regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. regions is a "category iv" institution under the frb's rules for tailoring enhanced prudential standards.
federal banking agencies allowed a phase-in of the impact of cecl on regulatory capital. at december 31, 2021, the add-back to regulatory capital was calculated as the impact of initial adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the allowance. the amount is phased-in over a three-year period beginning in 2022. at december 31, 2022, the net impact of the addback on cet1 was approximately $306 million or approximately 24 basis points. the add-back amounts will decrease by approximately $100 million each year, or approximately 8 basis points, in the first quarters of 2023, 2024, and 2025.
regions participates in supervisory stress testing conducted by the federal reserve and its scb is currently floored at 2.5 percent. see note 12 "regulatory capital requirements and restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding ccar results.
see the "executive overview" section for details on expectations of a range for cet1.
additional discussion of the basel iii rules, their applicability to regions, recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is included in the "supervision and regulation" subsection of the "business" section. additional discussion and a tabular presentation of the applicable holding company and bank regulatory capital requirements is included in note 12 "regulatory capital requirements and restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements.
liquidity regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management principals and regulatory expectations. the framework establishes sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report liquidity risks beginning with regions' liquidity management policy and the liquidity risk appetite statements approved by the board. processes within the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. while the framework is designed to comply with liquidity regulations, the processes are further tailored to be commensurate with regions' operating model and risk profile.
see the "supervision and regulation-liquidity regulation" subsection of the "business" section, the "risk factors" section and the "liquidity" section for more information.
risk management regions is exposed to various risks as part of the normal course of operations. the exposure to risk requires sound risk management practices that comprise an integrated and comprehensive set of programs and processes that apply to the entire company. accordingly, regions has established a risk management framework to manage risks and provide reasonable table of contents assurance of the achievement of the company's strategic objectives.
the primary risk exposures identified and managed through the company's risk management framework are market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, legal risk, compliance risk, reputational risk and strategic risk.
•market risk is the risk to the company's financial condition resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity prices.
•liquidity risk is the potential that the company will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding (referred to as "funding liquidity risk") or the potential that the company cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (referred to as "market liquidity risk").
•credit risk is the risk that arises from the potential that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation.
•operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events.
•legal risk is defined as the risk associated with the failure to meet regions' legal obligations from legislative, regulatory, or contractual perspectives.
•compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, or ethical standards.
•reputational risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding the company's business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.
•strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment.
several of these primary risk exposures are expanded upon further within the remaining sections of management's discussion and analysis.
regions' risk management framework outlines the company's approach for managing risk that includes the following four components:
•collaborative risk culture - a strong, collaborative risk culture is fundamental to the company's core values and operating principles. it ensures focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management and promote sound risk-taking within the bounds of the company's risk appetite. the company's risk culture requires that risks be promptly identified, escalated, and challenged; thereby, benefiting the overall performance of the company. sustaining a collaborative risk culture is critical to the company's success and is a clear expectation of executive management and the board.
•sound risk appetite - the company's risk appetite statements define the types and levels of risk the company is willing to take to achieve its objectives.
•sustainable risk processes - effective risk management requires sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report risk.
•responsible risk governance - governance serves as the foundation for comprehensive management of risks facing the company. it outlines clear responsibility and accountability for managing, monitoring, escalating, and reporting both existing and emerging risks.
clearly defined roles and responsibilities are critical to the effective management of risk and are central to the four components of the company's approach to risk management. regions utilizes the three lines of defense concept to clearly designate risk management activities within the company.
•1st line of defense activities provide for the identification, acceptance and ownership of risks.
•2nd line of defense activities provide for objective oversight of the company's risk-taking activities and assessment of the company's aggregate risk levels.
•3rd line of defense activities provide for independent reviews and assessments of risk management practices across the company.
the board provides the highest level of risk management governance. the principal risk management functions of the board are to oversee processes for evaluating the adequacy of internal controls, risk management, financial reporting and compliance with laws and regulations. the board has designated an audit committee of outside directors to focus on oversight of management's establishment and maintenance of appropriate disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting. see the "financial disclosures and internal controls" section of management's discussion and analysis for table of contents additional information. the board has also designated a risk committee of outside directors to focus on regions' overall risk profile. the risk committee annually approves an enterprise risk appetite statement that reflects core business principles and strategic vision by including quantitative limits and qualitative statements that are organized by risk type. this statement is designed to be a high-level document that sets the tone for the board's risk appetite, which is the maximum amount of risk the company is willing to accept in pursuit of its business objectives. by establishing boundaries around risk taking and business decisions, and by incorporating the needs and goals of its shareholders, regulators, customers and other stakeholders, the company's risk appetite is aligned with its strategic priorities and goals.
the risk management group, led by the company's chief risk officer, ensures the consistent application of regions' risk management approach within the structure of the company's operating, capital and strategic plans. the primary activities of the risk management group include:
•interpreting internal and external signals that point to possible risk issues for the company;
•identifying risks and determining which company areas and/or products will be affected;
•ensuring there are mechanisms in place to specifically determine how risks will affect the company as a whole and the individual area and or product;
•assisting business groups in analyzing trends and ensuring company areas have appropriate risk identification and mitigation processes in place; and
•reviewing the limits, parameters, policies, and procedures in place to ensure the continued appropriateness of risk controls.
as part of its ongoing assessment process, the risk management group makes recommendations to management and the risk committee of the board regarding adjustments to these controls as conditions or risk tolerances change. in addition, the internal audit division provides an independent assessment of the company's internal control structure and related systems and processes.
management, with the assistance of the risk management group, follows a formal process for identifying, measuring and documenting key risks facing each business group and determining how those risks can be controlled or mitigated, as well as how the controls can be monitored to ensure they are effective. the risk committee receives reports from management to ensure operations are within the limits established by the enterprise risk appetite statement.
some of the more significant processes used by management to manage and control risks are described in the remainder of this report. external factors beyond management's control may result in losses despite the risk management group's efforts.
effects of inflation the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature; therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies, which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories that are greatly impacted by inflation. while the implications differ for a bank, inflation does have influence on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting level of capitalization. inflation also affects the level of market interest rates, and therefore, the pricing of financial instruments.
management believes the most significant potential impact of inflation on financial results is a direct result of regions'ability to manage the impact of changes in interest rates. the company was asset sensitive as of december 31, 2022, and therefore, net interest income benefits from higher interest rates. recent hedging activity has reduced the exposure to net interest income due to changes in interest rates in the future. forward starting hedges beginning in 2023 and beyond are designed to protect net interest income and net interest margin against the potential for interest rates to move lower. refer to table 25 "interest rate sensitivity" for additional details on regions' interest rate sensitivity.
additionally, inflation has the potential to impact credit risk. periods of inflation could influence asset prices and business input costs which could affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans. the company has sound credit risk management practices to maintain a credit portfolio through the economic cycle. refer to the "credit risk" section for further details on regions credit risk management process.
effects of deflation a period of deflation would affect all industries, including financial institutions. potentially, deflation could lead to lower profits, higher unemployment, lower production and deterioration in overall economic conditions. in addition, deflation could depress economic activity and impair bank earnings through reduced balance sheet growth and less favorable product pricing, as well as impairment in the ability of borrowers to repay loans.
management believes the most significant potential impact of deflation on financial results relates to regions' ability to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to cushion against future market and credit related losses. however, the company can table of contents utilize certain risk management tools to help it maintain its balance sheet strength even if a deflationary scenario were to develop.
market risk-interest rate risk regions' primary market risk is interest rate risk. this includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the company offers. to quantify this risk, regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario. net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-term indicator of regions' interest rate risk.
sensitivity measurement-financial simulation models are regions' primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure. using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates. models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of regions' balance sheet. assumptions are made about the direction and magnitude of interest rate movements, the slope of the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and customer behavior. among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business. interest rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. regions considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior.
the primary objective of asset/liability management at regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles. in computing interest rate sensitivity, regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using "market forward rates." the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus and minus 100 and 200 basis points. in addition to parallel rate shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated. regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements.
exposure to interest rate movements-as of december 31, 2022, regions was asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the 12-month measurement horizon ending december 2023.
the estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term and long-term interest rates. currently, net interest income is projected to benefit from rising short-term interest rates (i.e. asset sensitive profile). an increase or reduction in short-term interest rates (such as the fed funds rate, the rate of interest on excess reserves, 1 month libor, sofr and bsby) will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates higher or lower. under either environment, it is expected that changes in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will only somewhat offset the change in asset yields.
net interest income remains exposed to intermediate and long term yield curve tenors. while this was a headwind to net interest income during a low rate environment, it represents a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve rises. an increase in intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as intermediate to longer-term u.s. treasuries, swaps and mortgage rates) will drive yields higher on certain fixed-rate, newly originated or renewed loans, increase prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases, and reduce amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio. the opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and long-term interest rates fall.
the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in table 25 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful. given the uncertainties associated with the impact of tightening monetary policy on industry liquidity levels and the cost of that liquidity, management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis from these key assumptions. sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future results.
the company's baseline balance sheet assumptions include management's best estimate for balance sheet growth in the coming 12 months. in the fourth quarter of 2022, regions experienced a continuation of declining low-cost deposit balances, both from the normalization of balances acquired from stimulative policies, as well as from late-cycle rate seeking behavior by higher balance customers. the baseline projects between $3 billion and $5 billion of additional deposit runoff over the first half of 2023, before balances stabilize and begin to modestly expand. an additional deposit outflow of $1 billion would reduce net interest income by $26 million over 12 months in the parallel +100 basis point scenario in table 25. conversely, if an additional $1 billion are retained a positive benefit of $26 million would be expected over 12 months in the parallel +100 basis point scenario in table 25.
table of contents in rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of legacy deposits will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. management assumes that in rising rate scenarios, some shift from non-interest- bearing to interest-bearing products will occur. the magnitude of the shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately $4 billion over 12 months in the parallel +100 basis point scenario in table 25. furthermore, over the 12 month horizon, an increase of $1 billion in deposit remixing would decrease net interest income by approximately $20 million, and a decrease of $1 billion in deposit remixing would increase net interest income by $20 million.
the deposit beta is calibrated using the experience from prior rate cycles and is dynamic across both interest rate level and time. in the base case scenario, management expects a mid-30 percent full cycle beta by year-end 2023. the parallel +100 basis point shock scenario in table 25 also incorporates an incremental beta of approximately 40 percent above the base case scenario. incremental deposit pricing outperformance or underperformance of 5 percent in the parallel +100 basis point shock would increase or decrease net interest income by approximately $40 million.
the table below summarizes regions' positioning over the next 12 months in various parallel yield curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). the scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities. some forward-starting swaps have starting dates beyond the next 12 months. therefore, while the impact of hedges on reported exposure is limited, they will meaningfully reduce the net interest income sensitivity to changes in market interest rates when they enter the measurement window. more information regarding hedges is disclosed in table 26 and its accompanying description.

regions' comprehensive interest rate risk management approach uses derivatives, as discussed further below, and debt securities to manage its interest rate risk position.
during the fourth quarter of 2022, as part of its dynamic balance sheet management strategy, the company executed transactions to extend incremental downside rate protection over a longer horizon and modestly adjusted near-term protection, which included adding $4 billion in forward-starting cash flow swaps.
approximately $3 billion of cash flow swaps are forward starting, 3 year, receive-fixed swaps that become active in 2025 with a weighted average, receive-fixed rate of 3.35 percent, paying overnight sofr. approximately $1 billion are forward starting, 6 month, receive-fixed swaps that become active in january 2023 with a weighted average, receive-fixed rate of 4.41 percent, paying overnight sofr.
subsequent to december 31, 2022, the company entered into $1.5 billion of forward-starting, 3 year, receive-fixed swaps that become active in january 2026 with a weighted average, received-fix rate of 3.01% percent, paying overnight sofr.
interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of regions' securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders' equity.
derivatives-regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity. alco, which consists of members of regions' senior management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies. derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit, and foreign exchange risks. the most common derivatives regions employs are forward rate contracts, futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward sale commitments.
table of contents forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield. futures contracts subject regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. because futures contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with futures. interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of interest payments. the notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements. interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time. forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. these contracts are executed on behalf of the company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. the company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform.
regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding position to a variable-rate position, to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt securities available for sale portfolio to a variable-rate position, and to effectively convert a portion of its floating-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. regions also uses derivatives to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business. in the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing.

regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions. for non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty. credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting table of contents agreements. when there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and/or posted to that counterparty. most hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by regions are subject to mandatory clearing. the counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse. the "credit risk" section in this report contains more information on the management of credit risk.
regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. interest rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers. other derivative instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio. instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of income.
the primary objective of regions' hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income and other financing income and the net present value of its balance sheet. the overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of regions' execution, the accuracy of its valuation assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates.
see note 20 "derivative financial instruments and hedging activities" to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of regions' year-end derivatives positions and further discussion.
regions accounts for residential msrs at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. regions enters into derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value fluctuations related to residential msrs. derivative instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of regions' current portfolio.
libor transition on march 5, 2021, the fca announced that libor would not be available for use after december 31, 2021 and would not be published after june 30, 2023. regions ceased origination of all new libor-based lending on december 31, 2021. existing contracts referencing usd libor settings must be remediated no later than june 30, 2023. regions holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of libor, including loans, investments, derivative products, floating-rate obligations, and other financial instruments that use libor as a benchmark rate. the company has established a libor transition program, which includes dedicated leadership and staff, with all relevant business lines and support groups engaged. as part of this program, the company continues to identify, assess, and monitor risks associated with the discontinuation of libor. steps to mitigate risks associated with the transition are being overseen by regions' executive libor steering committee. regions is following industry efforts to develop alternative reference rates and has been offering new benchmarks as they are adopted by regulatory agencies and industry groups.
regions has taken proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of customers, which include:
•the adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide for the determination of replacement rates for libor-linked financial products.
•the adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the u.s. regulators, arrc, and gses.
•the discontinuation of libor-based commercial lending on december 31, 2021, consistent with regulatory guidelines.
regions continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes, systems, and models to reference rates other than libor. regions has also implemented processes to educate all client-facing associates and coordinate communications with customers regarding the transition.
regions has exposure to libor-based products throughout several lines of business. as of december 31, 2022, regions had the following exposures that reference libor:
•approximately $13.5 billion of total commercial and investor real estate loans, of which approximately $12.0 billion mature after june 30, 2023;
•approximately $708.6 million of total consumer loans, all of which mature after june 30, 2023;
•securities within the investment portfolio of approximately $232 million, all of which mature after june 30, 2023;
•notional amount of interest rate derivatives totaling approximately $82.9 billion, of which approximately $73.9 billion mature after june 30, 2023;
•series b and c preferred stock with total carrying values of $433 million and $490 million, respectively, that reference libor when their dividend rate begins to float after libor is no longer published.
table of contents on march 15, 2022, the adjustable interest rate act was signed into law with the purpose of establishing a clear and uniform process for replacing libor in existing contracts. among the provisions of this legislation, contracts may be transitioned to sofr to gain a legal safe harbor. the company has assessed the impact of this legislation and expects to allow certain clients to fallback to sofr upon the cessation of libor, consistent with the guidelines in the legislation.
in the third quarter of 2020, regions adopted temporary accounting relief for affected transactions that reference libor. see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" in regions' annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020 for details.
market risk-prepayment risk regions, like most financial institutions, is subject to changing prepayment speeds on mortgage-related assets under different interest rate environments. prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net interest income. for example, mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a borrower, so that the borrower may refinance its obligations at lower rates. as loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate environment, regions must reinvest these funds in lower-yielding assets. prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce regions' interest income and overall asset yields. conversely, in a rising rate environment, these assets will prepay at a slower rate, resulting in opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates. prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value of equity. regions' greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in its mortgage-backed securities portfolio, the mortgage fixed-rate loan portfolio and the residential msr, all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements. each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment risk due to factors which are not necessarily the result of interest rates, but rather due to changes in policies or programs related, either directly or indirectly, to the u.s. government's governance over certain lending and financing within the mortgage market. such policies can work to either encourage or discourage financing dynamics and represent a risk that is extremely difficult to forecast and may be the result of non-economic factors. the company attempts to monitor and manage such exposures within reasonable expectations while acknowledging all such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided. further, regions has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non-interest income in the form of servicing income on the residential msrs. regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest income forecasting and interest rate risk management.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of regions and affects regions' ability to meet the needs of the company and its customers. regions' goal in liquidity management is to maintain liquidity sources and reserves sufficient to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, under normal and stressed conditions. accordingly, regions maintains a variety of liquidity sources to fund its obligations, as further described below. furthermore, regions performs specific procedures, including scenario analyses and stress testing to evaluate and maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity in alignment with liquidity risk.
regions' operation of its business provides a generally balanced liquidity base which is comprised of customer assets, consisting principally of loans, and funding provided by customer deposits and borrowed funds. maturities in the loan portfolio provide a steady flow of funds, and are supplemented by regions' deposit base. see note 4 "loans", note 10 "deposits", and note 11 "borrowed funds" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
the securities portfolio also serves as a primary source and storehouse of liquidity. proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities provide a continual flow of funds available for cash needs (see note 3 "debt securities" to the consolidated financial statements). furthermore, the highly liquid nature of the portfolio (for example, the agency guaranteed mbs portfolio) can be readily used as a source of cash through various secured borrowing arrangements. cash reserves, liquid assets and secured borrowing capabilities (including borrowing capacity at the fhlb, as discussed below) aid in the management of liquidity in normal and stressed conditions, and/or meeting the need of contingent events such as obligations related to potential litigation. see note 23 "commitments, contingencies and guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the company's funding requirements. liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in national money markets, though regions does maintain limits on short-term unsecured funding due to the volatility that can affect such markets.
the balance with the frb is the primary component of the balance sheet line item, "interest-bearing deposits in other banks." at december 31, 2022, regions had approximately $9.2 billion in cash on deposit with the frb and other depository institutions, a decrease from approximately $28.1 billion at december 31, 2021, as cash balances have been used to fund loan growth and for securities purchases throughout 2022 and as the company has experienced deposit declines as a result of normalizing pandemic liquidity. the average balance held with the frb was approximately $18.4 billion and $22.8 billion during 2022 and 2021, respectively. refer to the "cash and cash equivalents" section for more information.
regions' borrowing availability with the frb as of december 31, 2022, based on assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $13.2 billion.
table of contents regions' financing arrangement with the fhlb adds additional flexibility in managing the company's liquidity position. as of december 31, 2022, regions had no fhlb borrowings and its total borrowing capacity from the fhlb totaled approximately $14.5 billion. fhlb borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the fhlb. regions bank pledged certain eligible securities and loans as collateral for fhlb advances and future borrowing capacity. additionally, investment in fhlb stock is required in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. the fhlb has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding. refer to note 7 "other earning assets" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the sec that can be utilized by regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. additionally, regions' board has authorized regions bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time. refer to note 11 "borrowed funds" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. regulatory approval would be required for retirement of some instruments. see note 14 "shareholders' equity and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
in addition to the liquidity sources and obligations discussed above, the company also has other contractual obligations, which include unused commitments to extend credit, property leases, employee benefit obligations, and commitments to fund low income housing tax partnerships. see note 23 "commitments, contingencies and guarantees", note 13 "leases", note 17 "employee benefit plans", and note 2 "variable interest entities" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these obligations.
regions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. cash and cash equivalents at the holding company totaled $1.6 billion at december 31, 2022. overall liquidity risk limits are established by the board through its risk appetite statement and liquidity policy. the company's board, lroc and alco regularly review compliance with the established limits.
credit risk regions' objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an economic cycle. regions has various processes to manage credit risk as described below. in order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio, regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes, the current u.s. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets, as well as counterparty risk. see the "portfolio characteristics" section found earlier in this report for further information regarding the risk characteristics of each loan type. see further discussion of the current u.s. economic environment in the "economic environment in regions' banking markets" section and counterparty risk below.
management process credit risk is managed by maintaining a sound credit risk culture, throughout all lines of defense, which ensures that the levels and types of risk taken are aligned with regions' credit risk appetite. the credit quality of borrowers and counterparties has a significant impact on regions' earnings; however, the nature of the risk differs by each of the defined businesses which engage in multiple forms of commercial, investor real estate and consumer lending. regions categorizes the credit risks it faces by asset quality, counterparty exposure, and diversification levels which provides a structure to assess credit risk and guides credit decision-making. credit policies, another key component of regions' culture, are designed and adjusted, as needed, to promote sound credit risk management. these policies guide lending activities in a manner consistent with regions' strategy and provide a framework for achieving asset quality and earnings objectives.
effective credit risk management requires coordinated identification, measurement, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of credit risk exposure, credit quality, and emerging risk trends. accordingly, regions has implemented a credit risk governance structure that provides oversight from the board to the organizational units in order to maintain open channels of communication.
occasionally, borrowers and counterparties do not fulfill their obligations and regions must take steps to mitigate and manage losses. teams are in place to appropriately identify and manage nonperforming loans, collections, loan modifications, and loss mitigation efforts. regions maintains an allowance for credit losses that management considers adequate to absorb expected losses in the portfolio.
for a discussion of the process and methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses refer to the "critical accounting estimates and related policies" section found earlier in this report, note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 5 "allowance for credit losses" to the consolidated financial statements. details regarding the allowance for credit losses, including an analysis of activity from the previous year's total, are included in table 16 "allowance for credit table of contents losses". also, refer to table 17 "allowance allocation" for details pertaining to management's allocation of the allowance to each loan category.
responsibility and accountability for effectively managing all risks, including credit risk, in the various business units lies with the first line of defense. risk management, in the second line of defense, oversees, assesses and effectively challenges the risk-taking activities of the first line of defense. finally, credit risk review provides ongoing oversight, as a third line of defense function, of the credit portfolios to ensure regions' activities, and controls, are appropriate for the size, complexity and risk profile of the company.
counterparty risk counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction or contract could be unable or unwilling to fulfill its contractual or legal obligations. exposure may be to a financial institution (such as a commercial bank, an insurance company, a broker dealer, etc.) or a corporate client.
regions has a centralized approach to approval, management, and monitoring of counterparty exposure. the counterparty risk management group is responsible for the independent credit risk management of financial institution counterparties and their affiliates. market risk management is responsible for the measurement and stress testing of counterparty exposures. the corporate and commercial credit groups are responsible for the independent credit risk management of client side counterparties.
financial institution exposure may result from a variety of transaction types generated in one or more departments of the company. aggregate exposure limits are established to manage the exposure generated by various areas of the company. counterparty client credit risk arises when regions sells a risk management product to hedge risks in the client's business. exposures to counterparties are aggregated across departments and regularly reported to senior management.
information security risk regions faces information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber-attacks that are conducted regularly against financial institutions in attempts to compromise or disable information systems. such attempts have increased in recent years, and the trend is expected to continue for a number of reasons, including increases in technology-based products and services used by us and our customers, the growing use of mobile, cloud, and other emerging technologies, and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees.
regions devotes significant financial and non-financial resources to identify and mitigate threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its information systems. regions regularly assesses the threats and vulnerabilities to its environment so it can update and maintain its systems and controls to effectively mitigate these risks. layered security controls are designed to complement each other to protect customer information and transactions. regions regularly tests its control environment utilizing practices such as penetration testing and more targeted assessments to ensure its controls are working as expected. regions will continue to commit the resources necessary to mitigate these growing cyber risks, as well as continue to develop and enhance controls, processes and technology to respond to evolving disruptive technology and to protect its systems from attacks or unauthorized access. in addition, regions maintains a strong commitment to a comprehensive risk management program that includes due diligence and oversight of third-party relationships with vendors.
regions' system of internal controls also incorporates an organization-wide protocol for the appropriate reporting and escalation of information security matters to management and the board, to ensure effective and efficient resolution and, if necessary, disclosure of any matters. the board is actively engaged in the oversight of regions' continuous efforts to reinforce and enhance its operational resilience and receives education to ensure that their oversight efforts accommodate for the ever-evolving information security threat landscape. the board monitors regions' information management risk policies and practices primarily through its risk committee, which oversees areas of operational risk such as information technology activities; risks associated with development, infrastructure, and cybersecurity; approval and oversight of internal and third-party information security risk assessments, strategies, policies and programs; and disaster recovery, business continuity, and incident response plans. additionally, the board's audit committee regularly reviews regions' cybersecurity practices, mainly by receiving reports on the cybersecurity management program prepared by the chief information security officer, risk management, and internal audit. the board's technology committee, formed in february 2022, is charged with oversight of the overall role of technology in executing regions' business strategy and coordinates with the risk committee on risk assessment and management associated with technology-related strategic investments, major technology vendor relationships, and risks associated with information technology and security activities. the board annually reviews the information security program and, through its various committees, is briefed at least quarterly on information security matters.
regions participates in information sharing organizations such as fs-isac to gather and share information with peer banks and other financial institutions to better prepare and protect its information systems from attack. fs-isac is a nonprofit organization whose objective is to protect the financial services sector against cyber and physical threats and risk. it acts as a trusted third party that provides anonymity to allow members to submit threat, vulnerability and incident information in a non-
table of contents attributable and trusted manner so information that would normally not be shared is instead made available to other members for the greater good of the membership. in addition to fs-isac, regions is a member of bits. bits serves the financial community and its members by providing industry best practices on a variety of security and fraud topics.
regions has contracts with vendors to provide denial of service mitigation. these vendors have also committed the necessary resources to support regions in the event of a cyber event. even though regions devotes significant resources to combat cyber security risks, there is no guarantee that these measures will provide absolute security. as an additional security measure, regions has engaged a computer forensics firm and an industry-leading consulting firm on retainer in case of a cyber event. regions has also developed and maintains robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans that it could implement in the event of a cyber event to mitigate the effects of any such event and minimize necessary recovery time. some of regions' financial risk exposure with respect to data breaches may be offset by applicable insurance.
even when regions successfully prevents cyber-attacks to its own network, the company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information being obtained through breaches of retailers' networks that enable customer transactions. the related fraud losses, as well as the costs of re-issuing new cards, may impact regions' financial results. in addition, regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain business infrastructure components, and although regions actively assesses and monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors, regions' reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk.
in the event of a cyber-attack or other data breach, regions may be required to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs, costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil litigation arising from the event.
acquisitions enerbank on october 1, 2021, regions completed its acquisition of home improvement lender enerbank. the acquisition of enerbank allows regions to provide customers with home improvement financing solutions using enerbank's loan programs and digital solutions to support a wide range of home improvement needs.
as a result of the acquisition, regions recorded approximately $3.3 billion of assets of which $3.1 billion were loans that are included in regions' other consumer loan portfolio. regions also assumed $2.8 billion of liabilities, consisting almost entirely of time deposits that the company expects will attrite over time. the premiums recorded related to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were immaterial.
regions recorded pcd loans of $198 million as a result of the acquisition. regions recorded an immaterial alll related to these loans, which was included in the total acquired asset value as part of the acquisition.
in conjunction with the acquisition, regions recognized initial goodwill of $361 million and other intangible assets of $176 million. the other intangible assets were primarily comprised of customer relationship intangibles and will be amortized over the expected useful life of each recognized asset.
sabal on december 1, 2021, regions completed its acquisition of sabal, a financial services firm that leverages technology to facilitate off-balance-sheet lending in the small balance commercial real estate market.
as a result of the acquisition, regions recorded approximately $360 million of assets, which included loans held for sale totaling $82 million, as well as a commercial mortgage servicing asset and securities that were immaterial. regions also assumed $114 million of liabilities, consisting primarily of borrowings that were paid off following closing.
in conjunction with the acquisition, regions recognized initial goodwill of $146 million and other intangible assets that were immaterial.
financial disclosure and internal controls regions maintains internal controls over financial reporting, which generally include those controls relating to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap. regions' process for evaluating internal controls over financial reporting starts with understanding the risks facing each of its functions and areas, how those risks are controlled or mitigated, and how management monitors those controls to ensure that they are in place and effective. these risks, control procedures and monitoring tools are documented in a standard format. this format not only documents the internal control structures over all significant accounts, but also places responsibility on management for establishing feedback mechanisms to ensure that controls are effective.
regions also has processes to ensure appropriate disclosure controls and procedures are maintained. these controls and procedures as defined by the sec are generally designed to ensure that financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed in reports filed with the sec is reported within the time periods specified in the sec's rules and forms, and that such table of contents information is communicated to management, including the ceo and cfo, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
regions' disclosure review committee, which includes representatives from the legal, tax, finance, risk management, accounting, investor relations, and treasury departments, meets quarterly to review recent internal and external events to determine whether all appropriate disclosures have been made in reports filed with the sec. in addition, the ceo and cfo meet quarterly with the sec filings review committee, which includes senior representatives from accounting, legal, risk management, treasury, and the business groups. the sec filings review committee provides a forum in which senior executives disclose to the ceo and cfo any known significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in regions' internal controls over financial reporting, and provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements and other contents of the company's form 10-k and 10-q filings are accurate, complete, and timely. as part of this process, certifications of internal control effectiveness are obtained from regions' associates who are responsible for maintaining and monitoring effective internal controls over financial reporting. these certifications are reviewed and presented to the ceo and cfo as support of the company's assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. the form 10-k is presented to the audit committee of the board of directors for approval, and the forms 10-q are reviewed by the audit committee. financial results and other financial information are also reviewed with the audit committee on a quarterly basis.
as required by sections 302 and 906 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the ceo and the cfo review and make certifications regarding the accuracy of regions' periodic public reports filed with the sec, as well as the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. with the assistance of the financial review committees noted in the previous paragraph, regions continually assesses and monitors disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, and makes refinements as necessary.

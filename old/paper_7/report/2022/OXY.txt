oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis current business outlook and strategy general occidental's operations, financial condition, cash flows and levels of expenditures are highly dependent on oil prices and, to a lesser extent, ngl and natural gas prices, the midland-to-gulf-coast oil spreads, chemical product prices and inflationary pressures in the macro-economic environment. in 2022, as compared to 2021, the average annual price per barrel of wti crude increased to $94.23 from $67.91 and the average annual brent price per barrel increased to $98.83 from $70.78. the return of oil demand to its pre-pandemic levels, the ongoing global impact of the russia-ukraine war and the limited increase in supply in 2022 have resulted in an increase in benchmark oil prices year-over-year. occidental does not operate or own assets in either russia or ukraine. it is expected that the price of oil will be volatile for the foreseeable future given the current geopolitical risks, the ongoing global impact of the russia-ukraine war, and uncertainty around the global economy, oil demand in china as it emerges from its zero-covid policy, production levels in opec and non-opec oil producing countries and further releases from or additions to the us strategic petroleum reserve.
occidental works to manage inflation impacts by capitalizing on operational efficiencies, locking in pricing on longer term contracts and working closely with vendors to secure the supply of critical materials. as of december 31, 2022, substantially all of occidental's outstanding debt is fixed rate.
strategy occidental is focused on delivering a unique shareholder value proposition with its portfolio of oil and gas, chemicals and midstream and marketing assets and its ongoing development of carbon management and storage solutions and ghg emissions reduction efforts. occidental conducts its operations with a priority on hse, sustainability and social responsibility. occidental aims to maximize shareholder returns through a combination of:
■returning capital to shareholders, while redeeming a portion of preferred equity to continue improving occidental's financial position;
■enhancing its existing asset base with new investments in its core cash-generative oil and gas and chemical businesses as well as emerging low-carbon businesses with a focus on its net-zero pathway;
■advancing technologies and business solutions to help drive a sustainable low-carbon future; and
■further reducing long-term financial leverage.
operational excellence and capital efficiency occidental's operational priorities for 2022 were to maximize operational efficiencies by investing $4.5 billion in high return assets to generate long-term sustainable free cash flow that will provide cash flow stability throughout the commodity cycle. occidental set new operational records and efficiency benchmarks in the permian, rockies, gulf of mexico, oman and uae. oxychem generated record earnings, beating its previous record set in 2021. with the increase in commodity prices and occidental's focus on its operational efficiencies, occidental's higher cash flow allowed it to reduce its leverage and advance its shareholder return framework.
debt and interest rate swaps strong cash flow in 2022 allowed occidental to continue its deleveraging efforts. in 2022, occidental reduced its debt principal by more than $10.5 billion, leaving less than $18.0 billion outstanding as of december 31, 2022, and meeting its near-term debt reduction goal. as of december 31, 2022, occidental had debt maturities of approximately $22 million in 2023, $1.1 billion in 2024 and $1.2 billion in 2025. the current maturity of $22 million was paid in january 2023, leaving no debt maturing in 2023.
occidental's $673 million zero coupons can be put to occidental in october of each year, in whole or in part, for the then accreted value of the outstanding zero coupons. the zero coupons can next be put to occidental in october 2023, which, if put in whole, would require a payment of approximately $344 million at such date. occidental currently has the intent and ability to meet this obligation, including, if necessary, using amounts available under the rcf should the put right be exercised.
in the year ended december 31, 2022, occidental settled all outstanding interest rate swaps with $255 million in cash and the application of $144 million collateral, leaving none outstanding as of december 31, 2022.
debt ratings as of the date of this filing, occidental's long-term debt was rated bb+ by fitch ratings, ba1 by moody's investors service and bb+ by standard and poor's. occidental believes the deleveraging performed to date may lead to future ratings upgrades, but cannot determine the timing of any potential ratings change. any downgrade in credit ratings could impact occidental's ability to access capital markets and increase its cost of capital. occidental's non-investment grade debt rating may require occidental or its subsidiaries to provide financial assurance in the form of cash, letters of credit, surety bonds or other acceptable support under certain contractual arrangements.
oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis shareholder return framework capital is returned to shareholders through occidental's dividend and share repurchases. occidental's current dividend is $0.18 per share per quarter, or $0.72 on an annualized basis. during the fourth quarter of 2022, occidental completed its $3.0 billion share repurchase program. in february 2023, the board authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $3.0 billion of occidental's shares of common stock. occidental anticipates that a higher percentage of excess free cash flow is expected to be allocated to shareholder returns in 2023 with the intention to begin redeeming the preferred stock. occidental's preferred stock includes a mandatory redemption provision that obligates occidental to redeem the preferred at 110% of the par value on a dollar-for-dollar basis for every dollar distributed to common shareholders above $4.00 per share, on a trailing 12-month basis.
sustainability and environmental stewardship strategy in 2020, occidental was the first u.s. oil and gas company to announce goals to achieve net-zero ghg emissions for its total emissions inventory including use of sold products. these goals include achieving net-zero ghg emissions (i) from its operations and energy use before 2040, with an ambition to do so before 2035, and (ii) from its total carbon inventory, including the use of its sold products, with an ambition to do so before 2050. in 2020, occidental also set various interim targets, including 2025 carbon and methane intensity targets, and occidental was the first u.s. oil and gas company to endorse the world bank's initiative for zero routine flaring by 2030. in 2022, the board of directors adopted occidental's updated hse and sustainability principles, based on engagement with shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. the principles reinforce the alignment among occidental's core values, goals and strategies, underpin our operational management system, and help to guide our workforce across our businesses.
occidental seeks to meet its sustainability and environmental goals through its development and commercialization of technologies that lower both ghg emissions from industrial processes and existing atmospheric concentrations of co2. occidental believes that carbon removal technologies, including dac and ccus, can, with incentives necessary for their development and deployment, provide essential co2 reductions to assist the world's transition to a less carbon-intensive economy. during 2022, occidental undertook the following actions, among others, toward advancing its low-carbon strategy:
■achieved zero routine flaring of gas across its u.s. oil and gas operations, 8 years ahead of the world bank's 2030 target;
■reduced estimated methane emissions by 33% from the 2020 baseline;
■began construction activities for dac 1 in the permian;
■acquired interests in approximately 265,000 net acres of pore space access along the u.s. gulf coast; and
■invested approximately $530 million in low-carbon businesses, technologies, and net-zero pathway advancements, including the aforementioned pore space.
the future costs associated with emissions reduction, carbon removal and ccus to meet its long-term net-zero ghg goals may be substantial and execution of its plans and net-zero pathway depends on securing third-party capital investments. occidental is pursuing multiple pathways to fund these projects including project financing, long-term carbon removal or ccus agreements, and identifying business opportunities with stakeholders in carbon-intensive industries key performance indicators occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success against key performance indicators that drive total stockholder return. in addition to efficient capital allocation and deployment discussed below in the section titled oil and gas segment - business strategy, occidental believes its most significant performance indicators are:
operational
■total spend per barrel - in 2023, occidental will continue to focus on controlling total costs from a per-barrel perspective. total spend per barrel is the sum of capital spending, general and administrative expenses, other operating and non-operating expenses and oil and gas lease operating costs divided by global oil, ngl and natural gas sales volumes.
■daily production - occidental seeks to maximize field operability and minimize production down-time.
financial
■croce - croce is calculated as (i) the cash flows from operating activities, before changes in working capital, plus distributions from wes classified as investing cash flows, divided by (ii) the average of the opening and closing balances of total equity plus total debt.
■maintain and improve financial leverage to a level consistent with investment grade credit metrics.
sustainability and environmental
■specific interim emissions reduction and emissions intensity targets to advance our goal of net-zero operational and energy use emissions before 2040, with an ambition to achieve before 2035.
■milestones in specific carbon removal and ccus projects that advance our net-zero total emissions inventory, including use of sold products, with an ambition to achieve before 2050.
■facilitate deployment of carbon removal, ccus and other solutions to advance total carbon impact past 2050.
26       oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis oil and gas segment business strategy occidental's oil and gas segment focuses on long-term value creation and leadership in sustainability, health, safety and the environment. in each core operating area, occidental's operations benefit from scale, technical expertise, decades of high-margin inventory, environmental and safety leadership and commercial and governmental collaboration. these attributes allow occidental to bring additional production quickly to market, extend the life of older fields at lower costs and provide low-cost returns-driven growth opportunities with advanced technology.
occidental is one of the largest u.s. producers of liquids, which includes oil and ngl, allowing occidental to maximize cash margins on a per barrel basis. the advantages that occidental's portfolio provides, coupled with its advanced subsurface characterization ability and the proven ability to execute, position occidental for full-cycle success in the years ahead. the oil and gas segment maximizes efficiencies to deliver lower breakeven costs and generate excess free cash flow. the oil and gas segment strives to achieve low development and operating costs to maximize full-cycle value of the assets.
the oil and gas business implements occidental's strategy primarily by:
■operating and developing areas where reserves are known to exist and optimizing capital intensity in core areas, primarily in the permian basin, dj basin, gulf of mexico, uae, oman and algeria;
■maintaining a disciplined and prudent approach to capital expenditures with a focus on high-return, short and mid-cycle, cash-flow-generating opportunities and an emphasis on creating value and further enhancing occidental's existing positions;
■focusing occidental's subsurface characterization and technical activities on unconventional opportunities, primarily in the permian basin and rockies;
■using secondary and tertiary recovery techniques in mature fields; and
■focusing on cost-reduction efficiencies and innovative technologies to reduce carbon emissions.
in 2022, oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately $3.8 billion and primarily focused on occidental's assets in the permian basin, dj basin, gulf of mexico and oman. in 2023, occidental plans to spend $4.3 billion to $4.7 billion to develop its oil and gas assets.

management's discussion and analysis domestic interests business review occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases, subsurface mineral rights it owns, or a combination of both. occidental's domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to 10 years, which is extended through the end of production once it commences. occidental has leasehold and mineral interests in 9.5 million net acres, of which approximately 52% is leased, 47% is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1% is owned land with mineral rights. approximately $3.6 billion to $4.0 billion of occidental's worldwide capital budget is expected to be allocated to its domestic operations in 2023.
domestic assets (a)
1. powder river basin
2. dj basin
3. permian basin
4. gulf of mexico
(a)map represents geographic outlines of the respective basins.
the permian basin the permian basin extends throughout west texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states, accounting for more than 43% of total united states oil production in 2022. overall in 2022, occidental's production in the permian basin was approximately 513 mboe/d.
occidental manages its permian basin operations through two businesses: permian resources, which includes unconventional opportunities, and permian eor, which utilizes secondary and tertiary recovery techniques. occidental had a leading position in the permian basin, producing approximately 8% of the total oil in the basin in 2022. by exploiting the natural synergies between permian resources and permian eor, occidental is able to deliver unique short- and long-term advantages, efficiencies and expertise across its permian basin operations.
the permian resources unconventional business is focused on developing and producing unconventional reservoir targets using horizontal drilling technology. the development programs are designed to create long-term value from primary development by maximizing the recovery of oil, utilizing sustainable practices and providing strong financial returns. occidental's unconventional oil and gas operations in permian resources include approximately 1.4 million net acres. in 2022, our activities were focused in the core development areas with emphasis on maintaining the industry leading capital intensity through optimized surface infrastructure and customized well designs. overall, in 2022, permian resources produced from approximately 3,300 gross wells and added 387 mmboe to occidental's proved reserves through development and extensions of proved areas.
the permian basin's concentration of large conventional reservoirs, strong co2 flooding performance and the expansive co2 transportation and processing infrastructure has resulted in decades of high-value enhanced oil production. with 34 active co2 floods and over 50 years of experience, occidental is the industry leader in permian basin co2 flooding, which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10% to 25%. technology improvements, such as the recent trend toward vertical
28       oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis expansion of the co2 flooded interval into residual oil zone targets, continue to yield more recovery from existing projects, and permian eor produced from approximately 13,000 gross wells in 2022.
significant opportunities also remain to gain additional recovery by expanding occidental's existing co2 projects into new portions of reservoirs that have only been waterflooded. permian eor has a large inventory of future co2 projects, which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated, depending on market conditions.
in 2022, occidental spent approximately $2.3 billion of capital in the permian basin, of which approximately 93% was spent on permian resources assets.
rockies and other domestic in 2022, occidental produced approximately 277 mboe/d net in the rockies and other domestic locations. production in the dj basin is derived from 2,000 operated vertical wells and 2,400 operated horizontal wells primarily focused in the niobrara and codell formations. the dj basin, including the north dj basin, comprises approximately 800,000 total net acres and provides competitive economics, low breakeven costs and free cash flow generation through occidental's contiguous acreage position and royalty uplift.
in the dj basin, horizontal drilling results in the field continue to be strong, with improved operational efficiencies in drilling and completions. in 2022, occidental drilled 68 operated horizontal wells and completed 54 operated horizontal wells.
occidental is focusing on obtaining the necessary state, local and federal permits required to construct facilities and drill and complete wells in the dj basin. in january 2021, the cogcc adopted new regulations that impose siting requirements, or "setbacks," on certain oil and gas drilling locations based on the distance of a proposed well pad to occupied structures. under these new regulations and through thoughtful surface location planning, occidental obtained cogcc approval for five oil and gas development plans, inclusive of 12 well pad and facility locations and approximately 150 wells. in addition to the approximately 150 wells approved through the oil and gas development plan process, during the third quarter of 2022, occidental became the first oil and gas operator in colorado to obtain cogcc approval for the first comprehensive area plan under the new cogcc rules. this comprehensive plan will support nine well pads and approximately 140 new wells and will provide for substantial future development in a geographically remote area on colorado's eastern plains. oil and gas development plans associated with the comprehensive area plan will be submitted in 2023.
as of december 31, 2022, occidental is permitted, or had permit applications submitted to applicable regulatory agencies, for nearly all planned 2023 drilling and completions activity in the dj basin. in 2023, occidental plans to submit state and local permits with the goal of building operational inventory and maintaining its social license to operate in colorado. occidental has a dedicated stakeholder relations team that conducts regulatory and community outreach with respect to its permit applications and operations in colorado with a focus on building trust and fostering open communication with those that live and work near our operations.
occidental has gained efficiencies in the permitting process and will continue to look for additional opportunities to do so. as discussed above, occidental does not anticipate significant near-term changes to our development program in the dj basin based on these regulations. however, if occidental is unable to obtain new drilling permits to develop a significant portion of the company's undeveloped acreage in the dj basin, the company's dj basin assets may be subject to testing for impairment, and if deemed to be impaired, such impairment could be material to our financial statements.
occidental has interest in over 300,000 net acres in the powder river basin, mainly located in converse county and campbell county, wyoming. the field contains the turner, niobrara, mowry and parkman formations that hold both liquids and natural gas. in 2022, occidental drilled 19 operated horizontal wells and completed 14 horizontal wells in the powder river basin. the company plans to run one continuous operated drilling rig in 2023 with targeted completion activity throughout the year.
occidental holds approximately 4.6 million net acres in other domestic locations, which consist of legacy acreage and fee minerals outside of occidental's core operated areas including parts of arkansas, colorado, louisiana, texas, west virginia and wyoming.
offshore domestic assets gulf of mexico occidental is the fourth-largest oil and gas producer in the deep-water gulf of mexico, operating 10 strategically located deep-water floating platforms, the highest number among all the deep water operators, and producing from 18 active fields while owning a working interest across 252 blocks, including approximately 1.0 million net acres. occidental's position is one of the largest portfolios in the gulf of mexico.
occidental further operates two marine shore-bases in galveston, texas, and port fourchon, louisiana, as well as two helicopter bases in louisiana that all provide back up and redundancy to each other to support the gulf operations. a central logistics base with an integrated training center is located in broussard, louisiana, and the gulf of mexico operations and development are managed and supported with engineering and technical staff from the woodlands, texas, office tower.
in 2022, occidental increased net production to 147 mboe/d from approximately 88 gross wells, investing over $450 million in capital, including exploration capital, primarily directed towards drilling activity in its new horn mountain west subsea development, lucius and holstein facilities, drilling five wells using one floating drill ship, one platform rig and several service rigs. occidental successfully and safely initiated first production from its new horn mountain west field and tied back to the horn mountain facility, increasing production at the platform by over 34 mboe/d from three subsea oil wells, oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis on budget and three months ahead of schedule. in the fourth quarter of 2022, the new caesar-tonga subsea expansion project was also started several months ahead of schedule, debottlenecking the prolific giant caesar-tonga field and thus enabling future field expansion projects. major subsea-pumping projects supporting the marco polo/k2 field and the marlin/king field were progressed as well as extensive 4d seismic shoots in the holstein field and elsewhere, setting up a runway of future development opportunities.
operational excellence and efficiency continued as the prime objective in 2022 and gathered further momentum, reducing overall base production decline rates through the implementation of several successful well stimulations and artificial lift projects. platform operating efficiencies were significantly improved and machinery uptimes were increased all through subordinated focus and condition monitoring initiatives as well as multiple upgrade projects. continued optimum sequencing of annual platform turn-arounds provided further operational efficiencies, avoiding around two hundred days per year of shut-ins.
during 2022, all necessary regulatory permits for new wells and existing operations were obtained timely without any operational delays. occidental was further awarded 30 new leases from boem's lease sale 257 and was the second most successful bidder.
occidental's gulf of mexico assets continued to be among the lowest carbon emissions operations in the industry with zero routine flaring and zero cold venting.

in 2023, occidental will continue to enhance production by adding extended and dual laterals, stimulating wells with the oxy jettingtm wellbore stimulation system, and expanding thermal conformance. occidental will also continue to execute projects in oman targeting emissions reductions.
qatar in qatar, occidental partners in the dolphin energy project, an investment that is comprised of two separate economic interests. occidental has a 24.5% interest in the upstream operations (dolphin) to develop and produce ngl, natural gas and condensate from qatar's north field through mid-2032. occidental also has a 24.5% interest in del, which operates a pipeline and is discussed further in the midstream and marketing segment section in this form 10-k under pipeline. in 2022, occidental's net share of production from dolphin was 37 mboe/d.
uae in 2011, occidental acquired a 40% participating interest in the shah gas field (al hosn gas), joining with the abu dhabi national oil company, which expires in 2041. in 2022, occidental's net share of production from al hosn gas was 227 million cubic feet per day (mmcf/d) of natural gas and 35 mbbl/d of ngl and condensate. al hosn gas includes gas processing facilities which are discussed further in the midstream and marketing segment section in this form 10-k under gas processing, gathering and co2.
in 2019 and 2020, occidental acquired 9-year exploration concessions and, subject to a declaration of commerciality, 35-year production concessions for onshore block 3 and block 5, which cover an area approximately 1.5 million acres and 1.0 million acres, respectively, and are adjacent to al hosn gas. in 2022 and 2021, occidental announced multi-zone oil and gas discoveries in onshore block 3.
in 2023, occidental plans to complete an expansion project that commenced in 2022 to increase the production capacity of the al hosn gas processing facilities from 1.28 bcf/d to 1.45 bcf/d and continue further exploration and appraisal activities in onshore block 3 and block 5.
32       oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis proved reserves proved oil, ngl and natural gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements. oil, ngl and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs.
the following table shows the 2022, 2021 and 2020 calculated first-day-of-the-month average prices for both wti and brent oil prices, as well as the henry hub gas prices measured in mmbtu:
2022                    2021                    2020
wti oil ($/bbl)                                    $93.67                  $66.56                  $39.57
brent oil ($/bbl)                                  $97.77                  $69.24                  $43.41
henry hub natural gas ($/mmbtu)                     $6.36                   $3.60                   $1.98

occidental had proved reserves from continuing operations at year-end 2022 of 3,817 mmboe, compared to the year-end 2021 amount of 3,512 mmboe. proved developed reserves represented approximately 71% and 75% of occidental's total proved reserves at year-end 2022 and 2021, respectively. the following table shows the breakout of occidental's proved reserves from continuing operations by commodity as a percentage of total proved reserves:
2022               2021
oil                         50   %             50   %
ngl                         22   %             22   %
natural gas                 28   %             28   %
occidental does not have any reserves from non-traditional sources. for further information regarding occidental's proved reserves, see the supplemental oil and gas information section in item 8 of this form 10-k.
changes in proved reserves changes in occidental's 2022 reserves were as follows:
mmboe                                                 2022
revisions of previous estimates                     474
improved recovery                                    89
extensions and discoveries                          176
purchases                                            10
sales                                              (21)
production                                        (423)
total                                               305
occidental's ability to add reserves, other than through purchases, depends on the success of infill development, extension, discovery and improved recovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs. many of these factors are outside management's control and may negatively or positively affect occidental's reserves.
revisions of previous estimates revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic, production decline or operating performance data. in addition, product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by occidental. for example, lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves, particularly for domestic properties, because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations. offsetting this effect, lower prices increase occidental's share of proved reserves under pscs because more oil is required to recover costs. conversely, when prices rise, occidental's share of proved reserves decreases for pscs and economically recoverable reserves may increase for other operations. reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease, as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data.

management's discussion and analysis in 2022, occidental's revisions of previous estimates of proved reserves were positive 474 mmboe. these revisions were primarily due to 335 mmboe of positive revisions related to additions associated with infill development projects, mainly in the permian basin (232 mmboe) and the dj basin (94 mmboe). an additional 136 mmboe of positive revisions were related price revisions. the positive price revisions were primarily associated with the permian basin (147 mmboe), the gulf of mexico (8 mmboe) and the dj basin (4 mmboe), which were partially offset by negative price revisions of 29 mmboe on international pscs.
further positive revisions of 93 mmboe were associated with updates based on reservoir performance and 5 mmboe were associated with management changes in development plans. the positive revisions were offset by negative revisions associated with various other cost and interest related revisions (95 mmboe).
improved recovery in 2022, occidental added proved reserves of 89 mmboe related to improved recovery, primarily in the permian eor, which accounted for 87% of the improved recovery reserve additions. these properties comprise conventional projects, which are characterized by the deployment of eor development methods, largely employing application of co2 flood, waterflood or steam flood. these types of conventional eor development methods can be applied through existing wells, though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration. waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells. the use of either co2 or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation, the evaluation of engineering data, availability and cost of either co2 or steam and other economic factors. both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells. the remaining improved recovery additions were due to secondary and tertiary projects for certain international assets.
extensions and discoveries occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs. in 2022, extensions and discoveries added 176 mmboe primarily related to the recognition of proved reserves in the permian basin (155 mmboe) and powder river basin (7 mmboe).
purchases of proved reserves in 2022, occidental purchased proved reserves of 10 mmboe primarily consisting of proved reserves in the permian basin.
sales of proved reserves in 2022, occidental sold 21 mmboe in proved reserves related to the divestitures of certain non-strategic assets in the permian basin.
proved undeveloped reserves occidental had pud reserves at year-end 2022 of 1,119 mmboe, compared to the year-end 2021 amount of 865 mmboe.
changes in pud reserves were as follows:
mmboe                                                       2022
revisions of previous estimates                           270
improved recovery                                          49
extensions and discoveries                                107
purchases                                                   1
sales                                                    (10)
transfer to proved developed reserves                   (163)
total                                                     254
revisions of previous estimates were a positive 270 mmboe. approximately 263 mmboe of the positive revisions were related to additions associated with infill development projects in the permian basin (170 mmboe) and the dj basin (93 mmboe). additionally, the revisions included positive price revisions of 24 mmboe. the positive price revisions were primarily associated with the permian basin. the remaining positive revisions were associated with various updates based on reservoir performance. the positive revisions were offset by negative revisions associated with various other cost and interest related revisions (21 mmboe).
extensions and discoveries added 107 mmboe primarily related to the recognition of proved reserves in the permian basin (100 mmboe). total improved recovery additions of 49 mmboe were primarily the result of conventional projects in the permian eor (44 mmboe) and secondary and tertiary projects in international assets (5 mmboe). the 2022 additions to oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis pud reserves were partially offset by transfers to proved developed reserves of 163 mmboe. the transfers were primarily associated with the permian basin (89 mmboe), the dj basin (40 mmboe) and gulf of mexico (21 mmboe).
in 2022, occidental incurred approximately $1.2 billion to convert pud reserves to proved developed reserves, and in 2022 occidental converted approximately 19% of its pud reserves to proved developed, when adjusted for revisions and sales. as of december 31, 2022, occidental had 1,119 mmboe of pud reserves of which 73% were associated with domestic onshore, 4% with gulf of mexico and 23% with international assets. occidental's most active development areas are located in the permian basin, which represented 54% of the pud reserves as of december 31, 2022. occidental's total planned 2023 capital expenditures are between $5.4 billion and $6.2 billion. overall, occidental plans to spend approximately $4.6 billion over the next five years to develop its pud reserves in the permian basin.
pud reserves are supported by a five-year detailed field-level development plan, which includes the timing, location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled. only pud reserves which are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan. a portion of the pud reserves are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved long-term development projects.
as of december 31, 2022, occidental had 241 mmboe of pre-2018 pud reserves that remained undeveloped. these pud reserves relate to approved long-term development plans, 175 mmboe of which are primarily associated with international development projects with physical limitations in existing gas processing capacity and 66 mmboe of which are related to approved long-term development plans for permian eor projects, also with physical limitations in existing gas processing capacity. occidental remains committed to these projects and continues to actively progress the development of these volumes. in addition to the above, occidental has 57 mmboe of pud reserves that are scheduled to be developed more than five years from their initial date of booking. these pud reserves are related to approved long-term development plans, 41 mmboe of which are associated with international development projects and 16 mmboe with the gulf of mexico projects.
reserves evaluation and review process occidental's estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of december 31, 2022, were made by occidental's technical personnel and are the responsibility of management. the estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by occidental to develop the reserves. this process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts. as part of the proved reserves estimation process, all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures. price differentials between benchmark prices (the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year) and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves. production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analysis, type well profile analysis, computer simulation of the reservoir performance, volumetric analysis and material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes supported by various technologies including seismic analysis. these reliable field-tested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities.
net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor.
net pud reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. pud reserves are supported by a five-year, detailed, field-level development plan, which includes the timing, location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled. the development plan is reviewed and approved annually by senior management and technical personnel. annually, a detailed review is performed by occidental's corporate reserves group and its technical personnel on a lease-by-lease basis to assess whether pud reserves are being converted on a timely basis within five years from the initial disclosure date. any leases not showing timely transfers from pud reserves to proved developed reserves are reviewed by senior management to determine if the remaining reserves will be developed in a timely manner and have sufficient capital committed in the development plan. only pud reserves that are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan. a portion of the pud reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved long-term development plans.
the current senior vice president, reserves for oxy oil and gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates, in compliance with sec rules and regulations, including the internal audit and review of occidental's oil and gas reserves data. he has over 40 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business and has held various assignments in north america, asia and europe. he is a three-time past chair of the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee. he is an aapg certified petroleum geologist and currently serves on the aapg committee on resource evaluation. he is a member of the society of petroleum evaluation engineers, the colorado school of mines potential gas committee and the united nations economic commission for europe expert oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis group on resource management. he has bachelor of science and master of science degrees in geology from emory university in atlanta.
occidental has a reserves committee, consisting of senior corporate officers, to review and approve occidental's oil and gas reserves. the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidental's board of directors during the year. since 2003, occidental has retained ryder scott, independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes. for additional reserves information, see supplemental oil and gas information under item 8 of this form 10-k.
in 2022, ryder scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by occidental's engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of december 31, 2022, in accordance with sec regulatory standards. ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of occidental's 2022 year-end total proved reserves portfolio. in 2022, ryder scott reviewed approximately 42% of occidental's proved oil and gas reserves. since being engaged in 2003, ryder scott has reviewed the specific application of occidental's reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 92% of occidental's existing proved oil and gas reserves.
management retained ryder scott to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to occidental's reserve estimation and reporting process. ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by occidental. occidental has filed ryder scott's independent report as an exhibit to this form 10-k.
based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental, ryder scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current sec regulations.
industry outlook the oil and gas exploration and production industry is highly competitive, is subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions and operations are highly dependent on oil prices and, to a lesser extent, ngl and natural gas prices. oil prices increased significantly in 2022. during 2022, as compared to 2021, the average annual $/bbl of wti crude increased to $94.23 from $67.91 and the average annual brent price per barrel increased to $98.83 from $70.78.
oil prices will continue to be affected by: (i) global supply and demand, which are generally a function of global economic conditions, inventory levels, production or supply chain disruptions, technological advances, regional market conditions and the actions of opec, other significant producers and governments; (ii) transportation capacity, infrastructure constraints, and costs in producing areas; (iii) currency exchange rates and inflation rates; and (iv) the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions. the ongoing global impact of the russia-ukraine war and whether the oil industry will be able to sustain a continued supply response have resulted in an increase in benchmark oil prices year-over-year. occidental does not operate or own assets in either russia or ukraine. it is expected that the price of oil will be volatile for the foreseeable future given the current geopolitical risks, the ongoing global impact of the russia-ukraine war, the evolving macro-economic environment and supply activity (as a result of covid-19) from opec and non-opec oil producing countries and the biden administration's releases from the us strategic petroleum reserve.
ngl prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids. some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock. in addition, infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region.
domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals, as well as government regulations, global lng demand and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas.
we expect that oil prices in the near term will continue to be influenced by the duration and severity of the covid-19 pandemic and its resulting impact on oil and gas supply and demand.
these and other factors make it difficult to predict the future direction of oil, ngl and domestic gas prices reliably. for purposes of the current capital plan, occidental will continue to focus on allocating capital to high return assets with the flexibility to adjust based on fluctuations in commodity prices. international gas prices are generally fixed under long-term contracts. occidental continues to adjust capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions, such as supply chain constraints, rising interest rates, global logistics and high inflation, which has continued to disrupt global supply and demand balances, with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital.
the timing, process and ultimate cost to transition to a less carbon-intensive economy remains largely unknown; various industry forecasts indicate a growing demand for hydrocarbons for the remainder of the current decade. occidental believes its operational flexibility to achieve low development and operating costs to maximize full-cycle value of its assets and its knowledge and experience in co2 separation, transportation, use, recycling and storage position its oil and gas segment to support occidental's transition to net zero as well as create opportunities in a low-carbon future.
oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis chemical segment business strategy oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain, beginning with the co-production of caustic soda and chlorine. caustic soda and chlorine are marketed to external customers. in addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into pvc. oxychem seeks to be a low-cost producer in order to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns. oxychem's focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale. capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets. acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and pvc businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities. the conversion of the battleground chlor-alkali plant to membrane technology is expected to commence in 2023 with completion expected in 2026. in 2022, capital expenditures for oxychem totaled $322 million.
business environment although the united states economic growth lagged significantly behind that of 2021, demand for domestically produced products remained high, including liquid caustic soda and pvc. lockdowns in china, along with russia's invasion of ukraine increased the demand for u.s. produced products in 2022, as ethylene and energy costs remained advantaged over global pricing. caustic soda prices were significantly higher in 2022 and pvc pricing trended downward during the second half of 2022, as supply chain constraints, rising interest rates, global logistics and high inflation continued to disrupt global supply and demand balances.
business review basic chemicals despite the slower u.s. economic growth in 2022, chlor-alkali operating rates increased compared to 2021 as the u.s. maintained its competitive advantage in energy and feedstock costs. pricing and margins for most products were higher in 2022 due to strong demand in most market segments, and weather events and other supply disruptions restricted supply.
vinyls pvc demand softened in 2022 from record highs in 2021 resulting in a 7% decrease in domestic pvc demand. export demand strengthened in 2022 by 46% compared to 2021. year over year operating rates were flat in 2022 due to a softening pvc market during the second half of 2022 that was offset by the weather-related events experienced in early 2021. higher interest rates, lower housing starts, and inflation contributed to the lower domestic pvc demand and us producers shifted available volumes to the export markets. pvc exports represented 27% of total north american production in 2022 compared to 19% in 2021.
industry outlook industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy. response to inflation will continue to control the housing and construction sectors during 2023. automotive markets are expected to improve as semiconductor supply normalizes and demand responds. product margins will depend on market supply and demand balances, feedstock and energy prices, supply chain interruptions, labor constraints and rising inflation rates. further recovery in the petroleum industry should strengthen the demand and margins for some of occidental's products that are consumed by industry participants. u.s. commodity export markets could be impacted by the relative strength of the u.s. dollar.
basic chemicals demand for basic chemicals is expected to decline from the robust levels of 2022. demand in most market segments is expected to follow the trend of the general economy throughout 2023. demand for chlorine and derivatives should gradually improve across the year as international growth returns and the domestic housing, general construction and automotive markets begin to stabilize. demand for alkali products, particularly caustic soda, may decline moderately with lower demand in the pulp and paper, industrial and alumina markets. chlor-alkali operating rates should remain relatively flat overall in comparison with 2022 due to continued globally advantaged energy and raw material pricing as compared to global feedstock costs.
vinyls domestic pvc demand is expected to remain neutral to lower in 2023. residential construction spending is expected to be lower in 2023, while new domestic infrastructure projects and recovering global demand is expected to offset the domestic decline. new domestic pvc capacity came online in 2022 but is not expected to have a material impact on pvc production rates.
oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis midstream and marketing segment business strategy the midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize value by optimizing the use of its gathering, processing, transportation, storage and terminal commitments and by providing the oil and gas segment access to domestic and international markets. to generate returns, the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to occidental's subsidiaries, as well as third parties. the midstream and marketing segment operates or contracts for services on gathering systems, gas plants, co-generation facilities and storage facilities and invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
this segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas and power used in occidental's various businesses. capital is employed to sustain or expand assets to improve the competitiveness of occidental's businesses. in 2022, capital expenditures related to the midstream and marketing segment totaled $268 million.
also included in the midstream and marketing segment is olcv. olcv seeks to leverage occidental's carbon management expertise through the development of ccus projects, and invests in emerging low-carbon technologies that are expected to reduce our carbon footprint and enable others to do the same.
business environment midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its various businesses, including its marketing, gathering and transportation, gas processing and power-generation assets. the marketing business aggregates, markets and stores occidental and third-party volumes. marketing performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs. the marketing business results can experience significant volatility depending on commodity prices and the midland-to-gulf-coast oil spreads. the midland-to-gulf-coast oil spreads have decreased from an average of $0.48 per barrel in 2021 to $0.36 per barrel for the year ended december 31, 2022. a $0.25 change in the midland-to-gulf-coast oil spreads impacts total year operating cash flows by approximately $65 million. gas gathering, processing and transportation results are affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment's plants, as well as the margins obtained on related services from investments in which occidental has an equity interest.
business review marketing the marketing group markets substantially all of occidental's oil, ngl and natural gas production and optimizes its transportation and storage capacity. occidental's third-party marketing activities focus on purchasing oil, ngl and natural gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage capacity. these purchases allow occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets. in 2022, compared to the prior year, marketing results were impacted by the timing of crude oil sales, partially offset by higher gas marketing margin from transportation capacity optimization.
delivery and transportation commitments occidental has made long-term commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil, ngl and natural gas. the total amount contracted to be delivered is approximately 80 mmbbl of oil through 2025, 567 mmbbl of ngl through 2029 and 845 bcf of gas through 2029. the price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product.
occidental has crude pipeline take-or-pay capacity of approximately 850 mbbl/d to the gulf coast, leased crude storage capacity of approximately 10 mmbbl and capacity at the crude terminal of approximately 525 mbbl/d. certain of occidental's crude pipeline take-or-pay agreements expire in 2025 and take-or-pay commitments will reduce by two thirds by 2027.
pipeline occidental's pipeline business mainly consists of its 24.5% ownership interest in del. del owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline, known as the dolphin pipeline, which transports dry natural gas from qatar to the uae and oman. the dolphin pipeline has capacity to transport up to 3.2 bcf/d and currently transports approximately 2.0 bcf/d and up to 2.2 bcf/d in the summer months.
gas processing, gathering and co2
occidental processes its own and third-party domestic wet gas to extract ngl and other gas byproducts, including co2 and delivers dry gas to pipelines. margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for ngl.
as of december 31, 2022, occidental owned all of the 2.3% non-voting general partner interest and 49.5% of the limited partner units in wes. on a combined basis, with its 2% non-voting limited partner interest in wes operating, occidental's total effective economic interest in wes and its subsidiaries was 51.7%. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10-k for more information regarding
38       oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis occidental's equity method investment in wes. wes owns gathering systems, plants and pipelines and earns revenue from fee-based and service-based contracts with occidental and third parties.
occidental's 40% participating interest in al hosn gas also includes sour gas processing facilities that are designed to process 1.33 bcf/d of natural gas and separate it into salable gas, condensate, ngl and sulfur. in 2022, the project produced 568 mmcf/d of natural gas, 88 mbbl/d of ngl and condensate, and 10,700 tons/d of sulfur, of which occidental's net share was 227 mmcf/d of natural gas, 35 mbbl/d of ngl and condensate and 4,280 tons/d of sulfur.
in 2022, compared to the prior year, gas processing, gathering and co2 results increased primarily due to higher sulfur and ngl prices.
power generation facilities earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties.
low-carbon ventures olcv was formed to execute on occidental's vision to reduce global emissions and provide a more sustainable future through the development of low-carbon energy and products. olcv capitalizes on occidental's extensive experience in utilizing co2 in its development of ccus projects and providing services to third parties to facilitate the implementation of their ccus projects. moreover, olcv is fostering emerging technologies, including dac and low-carbon power sources, and other business models with the potential to position occidental as a leader in the production of low-carbon energy and products.
occidental has developed standards and protocols recognized by the epa for monitoring, reporting and verifying the amount, safety and permanence of co2 stored through secure geologic sequestration. occidental holds the nation's first two epa-approved monitoring, reporting and verification plans for geologic sequestration through eor production and obtained a third monitoring, reporting and verification plan in 2021. in 2022, olcv acquired approximately three hundred thousand acres of pore space. in 2022, occidental also commenced epa class 6 permitting with the intention of developing five sequestration hubs.
olcv commenced construction on the world's largest dac facility in 2022, which is expected to be online in 2025. olcv is also currently conducting front-end engineering design work and feasibility studies on a number of projects to capture and sequester co2, either from the atmosphere or from industrial point sources. in 2023, olcv plans to invest between $100 million and $500 million, dependent upon potential partner participation, to pursue various projects.
the profitability of sequestration projects is dependent upon the costs of developing, building and operating sequestration infrastructure, demand for sequestration services from emitters and the availability of certain tax attributes and credits generated from the capture and storage of co2.
in august 2022, congress passed the inflation reduction act that contains, among other provisions, certain tax incentives related to climate change and clean energy. these incentives may attract more third-party investment of olcv's projects which may help accelerate certain projects. the ultimate impact of the inflation reduction act on occidental's emerging low-carbon businesses and net-zero pathway will depend on a number of factors, interpretations and assumptions as well as additional regulatory guidance.
industry outlook midstream and marketing segment results can experience volatility depending on commodity price changes, demand impacting export sales and the midland-to-gulf-coast oil spreads. gas gathering, processing and transportation results are affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment's plants, as well as the margins obtained on related services from investments in which occidental has an equity interest.
throughout 2022, the u.s. experienced economy-wide cost increases, which could increase the cost of sequestration projects. occidental saw increased interest from third parties in providing sequestration services during the year. additionally, grants, credits and other tax-advantaged low-carbon attributes continue to be actively discussed at both state and federal levels. these trends are expected to continue, which occidental believes will enhance the economics of sequestration projects.

(b)natural gas volumes have been converted to boe based on energy content of six mcf of gas to one barrel of oil. boe equivalent does not necessarily result in price equivalency. please refer to the supplemental oil and gas information (unaudited) section of this form 10-k for additional information on oil and gas production and sales.
average daily production volumes from ongoing operations remained materially consistent in 2022 as compared to 2021. production increased in the permian basin due to increased development activity, which was partially offset by a decrease in production, especially natural gas, in the dj basin reflecting reduced capital investment and the impact of rising commodity prices that reduce occidental's share of production under international production sharing contracts.
lease operating expense the following table sets forth the average lease operating expense per boe from ongoing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2022:
2022                  2021                  2020
average lease operating expense per boe                    $9.52                 $7.58                 $6.38
average lease operating expense per boe increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily as a result of inflationary pressures which led to higher workover, support and maintenance costs in the permian basin, rockies and other and gulf of mexico, as well as higher purchase injectant costs in the permian basin.

44       oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis income taxes total deferred tax assets, after valuation allowance, were $2.2 billion and $3.5 billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets, net of any allowances, through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences. the total deferred tax liabilities were $7.7 billion and $10.5 billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the decrease in net deferred tax liability in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the legal entity reorganization that occidental undertook in the first quarter of 2022. see more discussion below.

in 2022, occidental's worldwide effective tax rate was 6%, which was impacted by a tax benefit associated with occidental's legal entity reorganization, as further described below.
in 2021, occidental's worldwide effective tax rate was 25%, which was higher than the u.s. statutory rate of 21% due to higher tax rates in the foreign jurisdictions in which occidental operates, partially offset by the tax impact of business credits, state tax revaluations and other domestic tax benefits.
in 2020, occidental's worldwide effective tax rate was 14%, which was largely a result of the impairment of the wes goodwill and certain international assets for which occidental received no tax benefit and higher-taxed international operations which generally caused occidental's tax rate to vary significantly from the u.s. corporate tax rate.
legal entity reorganization to align occidental's legal entity structure with the nature of its business activities after completing the anadarko acquisition and subsequent large scale post-acquisition divestiture program, management undertook a legal entity reorganization that was completed in the first quarter of 2022.
as a result of this legal entity reorganization, management made an adjustment to the tax basis in a portion of its operating assets, thus reducing occidental's deferred tax liabilities. accordingly, in 2022, occidental recorded a tax benefit of $2.7 billion in connection with this reorganization. the timing of any reduction in occidental's future cash taxes as a result of this legal entity reorganization will be dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing commodity prices, capital activity level and production mix. the legal entity reorganization transaction is currently under irs review as part of the company's 2022 federal tax audit.
inflation reduction act in august 2022, congress passed the inflation reduction act that contains, among other provisions, a corporate book minimum tax on financial statement income, an excise tax on stock buybacks, a methane emissions fee and certain tax incentives related to climate change and clean energy. occidental is currently evaluating the provisions of this act. the ultimate impact of the act is yet to be determined and will depend on additional regulatory guidance and interpretations.

oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with united states gaap requires occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions. changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts. the selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors. occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management's judgment.
oil and gas properties the carrying value of occidental's pp&e represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any aros and capitalized interest, net of dd&a and any impairment charges. for assets acquired in a business combination, pp&e cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date. aros and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets.
occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. under this method, occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs. the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. if proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized. for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot be classified as proved when drilling is completed, costs continue to be capitalized as suspended exploratory drilling costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the economic and operating viability of the project. at the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities and in particular, whether occidental is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed.
occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production and geological and geophysical costs as incurred for exploration activities.
occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method. it amortizes leasehold acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
several factors could change occidental's proved oil and gas reserves. for example, occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit. occidental's share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline. generally, occidental's net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices. in other cases, particularly with long-lived properties, lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical. for such properties, higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical. estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidental's control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs. these factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves. additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded. changes in the political and regulatory climate could lead to decreases in proved reserves as development horizons may be extended into the future.
occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable. if there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to significant and prolonged declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management's plans or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment. under the successful efforts method, if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period. individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows unless observable and comparable transactions are available. the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants. the impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time. these assumptions include estimates of future production, product prices, contractual prices, estimates of risk-adjusted oil and gas proved and unproved reserves and estimates of oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis future operating and development costs. it is reasonably possible that prolonged declines in commodity prices, reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in impairments.
for impairment testing, unless prices are contractually fixed, occidental uses observable forward strip prices for oil and natural gas prices when projecting future cash flows. future operating and development costs are estimated using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce oil and gas reserves. market prices for oil, ngl and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. changes in global supply and demand, transportation capacity, currency exchange rates, applicable laws and regulations and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions could impact current forecasts. future fluctuations in commodity prices could result in estimates of future cash flows to vary significantly.
net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $12.6 billion as of december 31, 2022, and $14.8 billion as of december 31, 2021. the unproved amounts are not subject to dd&a until they are classified as proved properties. individually insignificant unproved properties are combined and amortized on a group basis based on factors such as lease terms, success rates and other factors to provide for full amortization upon lease expiration or abandonment.
significant unproved properties, primarily as a result of the anadarko acquisition, are assessed individually for impairment and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recovered a valuation allowance is provided if an impairment is indicated. occidental periodically reviews significant unproved properties for impairments; numerous factors are considered, including but not limited to, availability of funds for future exploration and development activities, current exploration and development plans, favorable or unfavorable exploration activity on the property or the adjacent property, geologists' evaluation of the property, the current and projected political and regulatory climate, contractual conditions and the remaining lease term for the properties. if an impairment is indicated, occidental will first determine whether a comparable transaction for similar properties or implied acreage valuation derived from domestic onshore market participants is available and will adjust the carrying amount of the unproved property to its fair value using the market approach. in situations where the market approach is not observable and unproved reserves are available, undiscounted future net cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based on managements' risk adjusted estimates of unproved reserves, future commodity prices and future costs to produce the reserves. if undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property, the future net cash flows are discounted and compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record. occidental utilizes the same assumptions and methodology discussed above for cash flows associated with proved properties.
proved reserves occidental estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the sec's rule 4-10 (a) of regulation s-x and financial accounting standards board. proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions. for reserves information, see the supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities under item 8 of this form 10-k.
engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. occidental's estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. these estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, development plans, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. a material adverse change in the estimated volume of proved reserves could have a negative impact on dd&a and could result in property impairments.
the most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in occidental's oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the dd&a rate. for example, a 5% increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the dd&a rate by approximately $0.60/bbl, which would increase or decrease pre-tax income by approximately $270 million annually at current production rates.
fair values occidental estimates fair-value of long-lived assets for impairment testing, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non-monetary transactions, pension plan assets and initial measurements of aros.
accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis recorded as goodwill. the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value, which may be determined using different methods of fair value measurements, largely based on the availability and quality of market information. occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
financial assets and liabilities occidental utilizes published prices or counterparty statements for valuing the majority of its financial assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. in addition to using market data, occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
■occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date. these derivatives are classified as using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities (level 1).
■otc bilateral financial commodity contracts, international exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities (level 2) and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
■occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves. the assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as using unobservable inputs (level 3) within the valuation hierarchy.
■occidental values debt using market-observable information for debt instruments that are traded on secondary markets. for debt instruments that are not traded, the fair value is determined by interpolating the value based on debt with similar terms and credit risk.
non-financial assets occidental uses market-observable prices for assets when comparable transactions can be identified that are similar to the asset being valued. when occidental is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or for a similar asset then the cost or income approach is used depending on the quality of information available to support management's assumptions. the cost approach is based on management's best estimate of the current asset replacement cost. the income approach is based on management's best assumptions regarding expectations of future net cash flows and the expected cash flows are discounted using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. such evaluations involve significant judgment. the results are based on expected future events or conditions such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, economic and regulatory climates and other factors, most of which are often outside of management's control. however, assumptions used reflect a market participant's view of long-term prices, costs and other factors and are consistent with assumptions used in occidental's business plans and investment decisions.
environmental liabilities and expenditures certain subsidiaries of occidental incur environmental liabilities and expenditures that relate to current operations and are expensed or capitalized by such subsidiaries as appropriate. certain subsidiaries also incur environmental liabilities and expenditures with respect to remediation of existing conditions from alleged past practices at third-party, currently operated, and closed or non-operated sites. those environmental liabilities and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs from past operations are recorded when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. occidental discloses such remediation liabilities on a consolidated basis. in determining the environmental remediation liability and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements. these environmental remediation liabilities are based on management's estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective. occidental periodically reviews these environmental remediation liabilities and adjusts them as new information becomes available. occidental's subsidiaries generally record reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
many factors could affect future remediation costs incurred by occidental's subsidiaries and result in adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and the range of reasonably possible additional losses. the most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may vary from the initial estimate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and oxy 2022 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify proposed remedial plans; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.
certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which generally fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among the affected occidental's subsidiary and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs. in these circumstances, the affected subsidiary evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to such subsidiary of their failure to participate when estimating its ultimate share of liability. occidental subsidiaries record environmental remediation liabilities at their expected net cost of remedial activities. based on these factors, except as otherwise disclosed in note 12 - environmental liabilities and expenditures in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10-k, occidental's subsidiaries believe that they will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
in addition to the costs of investigations and clean-up measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at cercla npl sites, occidental subsidiaries' environmental remediation liabilities include estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems. if remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, occidental's subsidiaries review and adjust their environmental remediation liabilities accordingly.
if occidental or its subsidiaries were to adjust the balance of their environmental remediation liabilities based on the factors described above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings. for example, if the balance were reduced by 10%, occidental would record a pre-tax increase to income of $105 million. if the balance were increased by 10%, occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $105 million.
income taxes occidental and its subsidiaries file various u.s. federal, state and foreign income tax returns. the impact of changes in tax regulations are reflected when enacted. in general, deferred federal, state and foreign income taxes are provided on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. occidental routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. if occidental concludes that it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. occidental recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefit recorded is equal to the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized through final settlement with a taxing authority. interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense (benefit). see note 10 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10-k.
loss contingencies occidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings and audits. occidental or its affected subsidiaries, as appropriate, accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. in addition, occidental discloses, in aggregate on a consolidated basis, exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred. occidental reviews such loss contingencies on an ongoing basis.
loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate. management's judgments could change based on new information, changes in, or interpretations of, laws or regulations, changes in management's plans or intentions, opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings or other factors. see note 13 - lawsuits, claims, commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information.

covid-19
the covid-19 pandemic and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the u.s. and other countries around the world. our strong local presence and scale in communities across the country has enabled us to continue to play an indispensable role in the national response to covid-19, as well as provide seamless support for our customers wherever they need us: in our cvs locations, in their homes, and virtually. the covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the company's operating results for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, primarily in the company's health care benefits and retail/ltc segments.
health care benefits segment beginning in mid-march 2020, the health care system experienced a significant reduction in utilization of medical services ("utilization") that is discretionary and the cancellation of elective medical procedures. utilization remained below historical levels through april 2020, began to recover in may and june 2020 and reached more normal levels in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, with select geographies impacted by covid-19 waves. in response to covid-19, the company provided expanded benefit coverage to its members, including cost-sharing waivers for covid-19 related treatments, as well as assistance to members through premium credits, telehealth cost-sharing waivers and other investments. during 2020, covid-19 also resulted in a shift in the company's medical membership. the company experienced declines in commercial membership due to reductions in workforce at our existing customers, substantially offset by increases in medicaid membership primarily as a result of the suspension of eligibility redeterminations and increased unemployment.
during the year ended december 31, 2021, overall medical costs in the first quarter were generally consistent with historical baseline levels in the aggregate, however the segment experienced increased covid-19 testing and treatment costs and lower medicare risk-adjusted revenue. during the second quarter, covid-19 testing and treatment costs persisted, however at levels significantly lower than those observed during the first quarter. beginning in the third quarter of 2021, medical costs once again increased primarily driven by the spread of emerging new variants of covid-19, which resulted in increased testing and treatment costs throughout the remainder of the year.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, the impact of covid-19 within the health care benefits segment has generally stabilized as a result of the company's ability to capture covid-19 related medical costs in pricing.
retail/ltc segment during march 2020, the company experienced increased prescription volume due to the greater use of 90-day prescriptions and early refills of maintenance medications, as well as increased front store volume as consumers prepared for the covid-19 pandemic. beginning in the second quarter and continuing throughout the remainder of the year, the company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies and minuteclinic locations due to shelter-in-place orders as well as reduced new therapy prescriptions and decreased long-term care prescription volume as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. in addition, the company incurred incremental operating expenses associated with the company's covid-19 pandemic response efforts and waived fees associated with prescription home delivery and associated front store products. during 2020, the company also played a key role in supporting the local communities in which it operates through the administration of diagnostic testing at its cvs pharmacy locations, as well as in long-term care facilities, at community-based testing sites in underserved areas and through its return readysm solution. the company also began administering covid-19 vaccinations in long-term care facilities during december 2020.
during the first quarter of 2021, the company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies, which reflected the impact of a weaker cough, cold and flu season, while it administered the highest quarterly volume of covid-19 diagnostic tests. the company began administering covid-19 vaccines in its retail pharmacies during february 2021. during the second quarter, the segment generated earnings from covid-19 vaccines and saw improved customer traffic as vaccinated customers began more actively shopping in cvs locations. during the third and fourth quarters, emerging new variants drove the continued administration of covid-19 vaccinations (including boosters) and diagnostic testing, while the segment also generated earnings from the sale of over-the-counter ("otc") test kits in the front store. during the year ended december 31, 2021, the company administered more than 32 million covid-19 tests and more than 59 million covid-19 vaccines and sold more than 22 million otc test kits.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, the customary quarterly operating income progression in the retail/ltc segment continued to be impacted by covid-19. during the first quarter, the company saw high volumes of administration of covid-19 vaccinations, as well as demand for otc test kits in the front store, particularly in the beginning of the year when the omicron variant incidence was high. in addition, the company administered the highest quarterly volume of covid-19 diagnostic tests of 2022 during the first quarter, however a decline compared to the prior year. during the second and third quarters, the company continued to generate earnings from the sale of otc test kits, as customers performed more in-home testing versus diagnostic testing, in addition to earnings from the continued administration of covid-19 diagnostic testing and vaccinations, albeit at lower levels than those experienced in the first quarter. during the fourth quarter, the company saw an increase in covid-19 vaccine administration from the prior quarter related to the bivalent covid-19 booster. during the year ended december 31, 2022, the company administered more than 15 million covid-19 tests and nearly 28 million covid-19 vaccines and sold more than 63 million otc test kits.
the covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve. the company believes covid-19's impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic's impact on the u.s. and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of legislation as well as other federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic. those primary drivers are beyond the company's knowledge and control. as a result, the impact covid-19 will have on the company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. covid-19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims against the company.

commentary - 2022 compared to 2021
revenues
•total revenues increased $30.4 billion, or 10.4%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase in total revenues was primarily driven by growth across all segments.
•please see "segment analysis" later in this md&a for additional information about the revenues of the company's segments.
operating expenses
•operating expenses increased $1.1 billion, or 3.1%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased operating expenses to support growth in the business, incremental investments in business operations and decreased gains from legal settlements in 2022 compared to 2021. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets compared to the prior year, as well as pre-tax gains of $250 million on the sale of the company's wholly-owned subsidiary bswift llc ("bswift") and $225 million on the sale of payflex holdings, inc. ("payflex"), both of which were sold during 2022.
•operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 11.8% in 2022 compared to 12.7% in 2021. the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to the increases in total revenues described above.
•please see "segment analysis" later in this md&a for additional information about the operating expenses of the company's segments.
operating income
•operating income decreased $5.4 billion, or 41.3%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the decrease in operating income was primarily driven by the $5.8 billion of opioid litigation charges and declines in the retail/ltc segment, which included a $2.5 billion loss on assets held for sale related to the write-down of the company's omnicare® long-term care business ("ltc business") during 2022, partially offset by the absence of a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion and a $431 million goodwill impairment charge on the remaining goodwill of the ltc reporting unit, both of which were recorded in the prior year. these decreases were partially offset by increases in the health care benefits segment, which included the pre-tax gains of $250 million on the sale of bswift and $225 million on the sale of payflex and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets, as well as improved purchasing economics and growth in specialty pharmacy in the pharmacy services segment.
•please see "segment analysis" later in this md&a for additional information about the operating results of the company's segments.
interest expense
•interest expense decreased $216 million, or 8.6%, in 2022 compared to 2021, due to lower debt in the year ended december 31, 2022. see "liquidity and capital resources" later in this report for additional information.
loss on early extinguishment of debt
•during 2021, the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to the company's repayment of approximately $2.3 billion of its outstanding senior notes in december 2021 pursuant to its early redemption make-whole provision for such senior notes, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $89 million, and the repayment of approximately $2.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes pursuant to its tender offer for such notes in august 2021, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $363 million. see note 8 ''borrowings and credit agreements'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information.
income tax provision
•the company's effective income tax rate increased to 26.0% in 2022 compared to 24.2% in the prior year. the increase was primarily due to certain nondeductible legal charges and basis differences on the sale of certain subsidiaries in 2022. these increases were partially offset by the impact of certain discrete tax items concluded in the first quarter of 2022.
outlook for 2023
with respect to 2023, the company believes you should consider the following important information:
•the health care benefits segment is expected to continue to benefit from medicare and commercial membership growth, partially offset by declines in medicaid due to the impact of redeterminations in 2023.
•the pharmacy services segment is expected to continue to benefit from the company's ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics and strong pharmacy network volume. these increases are expected to be partially offset by continued client price improvements and regulation of pharmacy pricing.
•the retail/ltc segment is expected to continue to benefit from increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and lower contributions from covid-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and otc test kits as covid-19 transitions to the endemic stage.
•the company is expected to benefit from enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives, which aim to reduce the company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. key drivers include:
•investments in digital, technology and analytics capabilities that will streamline processes and improve outcomes,
•implementing workforce and workplace strategies, and
•deploying vendor and procurement strategies.
•the company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the company's businesses.
•the covid-19 pandemic continues to impact the economies of the u.s. and other countries around the world. the company believes covid-19's impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the pandemic's impact on the u.s. and global economies, global supply chain, consumer behavior, and health care utilization patterns. in addition, as described in the "government regulation" section of this form 10-k, federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of covid-19 and emerging new variants may not effectively combat the severity and/or duration of the covid-19 pandemic, and have resulted in a myriad of impacts on the company's businesses. those primary drivers are beyond the company's knowledge and control. as a result, the impact covid-19 will have on the company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material.
the company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements. please see "risk factors" included in item 1a of this 10-k and the "cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements" in this 10-k for information regarding important factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ from those currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the company.
segment analysis the following discussion of segment operating results is presented based on the company's reportable segments in accordance with the accounting guidance for segment reporting and is consistent with the segment disclosure in note 17 ''segment reporting'' included in item 8 of this 10-k.
the company has three operating segments, health care benefits, pharmacy services and retail/ltc, as well as a corporate/other segment. the company's segments maintain separate financial information, and the company's chief operating decision maker (the "codm") evaluates the segments' operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. the codm evaluates the performance of the company's segments based on adjusted operating income, which is defined as operating income (gaap measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the company's business nor reflect the company's underlying business performance. see the reconciliations of operating income (gaap measure) to adjusted operating income below for further context regarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. the company uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the company's ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. non-gaap financial measures the company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with gaap.
the following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the company's segments to the consolidated totals:

_____________________________________________
(1)total revenues of the pharmacy services segment include approximately $12.6 billion, $11.6 billion and $10.9 billion of retail co-payments for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. see note 1 ''significant accounting policies'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information about retail co-payments.
(2)intersegment revenue eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the health care benefits segment, the pharmacy services segment, and/or the retail/ltc segment. intersegment adjusted operating income eliminations occur when members of pharmacy services segment clients enrolled in maintenance choice® elect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of the company's retail pharmacies instead of receiving them through the mail. when this occurs, both the pharmacy services and retail/ltc segments record the adjusted operating income on a stand-alone basis.

_____________________________________________
(1)the company's acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting which consist primarily of trademarks, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology, provider networks and value of business acquired. definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the company's gaap consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within each segment. although intangible assets contribute to the company's revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the company's insurance products, the services performed for the company's customers or the sale of the company's products or services. additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the company's acquisition activity. accordingly, the company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the company's and investors' ability to compare the company's past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-gaap financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the company's gaap financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-gaap financial measure. intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-gaap financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.
(2)in 2022, the office real estate optimization charges primarily relate to the abandonment of leased real estate and the related right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned reduction of corporate office real estate space in response to the company's new flexible work arrangement. the office real estate optimization charges are reflected in the company's gaap consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses within the health care benefits, corporate/other and pharmacy services segments.
(3)in 2022, the gain on divestiture of subsidiaries represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of bswift, which the company sold in november 2022, and the pre-tax gain on the sale of payflex, which the company sold in june 2022. in 2020, the gain on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of the workers' compensation business, which the company sold in july 2020. the gains on divestitures are reflected as a reduction of operating expenses in the company's gaap consolidated statements of operations within the health care benefits segment.
(4)in 2022, the opioid litigation charges relate to agreements to resolve substantially all opioid claims against the company by certain states and governmental entities. the opioid litigation charges are reflected within the corporate/other segment.
(5)in 2022, the loss on assets held for sale relates to the ltc reporting unit within the retail/ltc segment. the company continually evaluates its portfolio for non-strategic assets. the company determined that its ltc business was no longer a strategic asset and during the third quarter of 2022 committed to a plan to sell the ltc business. as of september 30, 2022, the ltc business met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and the net assets were accounted for as assets held for sale. the carrying value of the ltc business was determined to be greater than its estimated fair value less costs to sell and a loss on assets held for sale was recorded during the third quarter of 2022. as of december 31, 2022, the net assets of the ltc business continued to meet the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and during the fourth quarter of 2022, an incremental loss on assets held for sale was recorded to write down the carrying value of the ltc business to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. during 2022, the loss on assets held for sale also relates to the commercial business reporting unit within the health care benefits segment. in march 2022, the company reached an agreement to sell its international health care business domiciled in thailand ("thailand business"), which was included in the commercial business reporting unit. at that time, a portion of the commercial business goodwill was specifically allocated to the thailand business. the net assets of the thailand business were accounted for as assets held for sale at march 31, 2022. the carrying value of the thailand business was determined to be greater than its estimated fair value less costs to sell and a loss on assets held for sale was recorded during the first quarter of 2022. the sale of the thailand business closed in the second quarter of 2022, and the ultimate loss on the sale was not material.
(6)in 2021 and 2020, acquisition-related integration costs relate to the company's acquisition (the "aetna acquisition") of aetna inc. ("aetna"). the acquisition-related integration costs are reflected in the company's gaap consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the corporate/other segment.
(7)in 2021, the store impairment charge relates to the write down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. the store impairment charge is reflected within the retail/ltc segment.
(8)in 2021, the goodwill impairment charge relates to an impairment of the remaining goodwill of the ltc reporting unit within the retail/ltc segment.
(9)in 2021, the company received $61 million related to a purchase price working capital adjustment for an acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2020. the resolution of this matter occurred subsequent to the acquisition accounting measurement period and is reflected in the company's gaap consolidated statement of operations as a reduction of operating expenses within the health care benefits segment.
(10)in 2020, the company received $313 million owed to it under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 (as amended, collectively, the "aca")'s risk corridor program that was previously fully reserved for as payment was uncertain. after considering offsetting items such as the aca's minimum medical loss ratio ("mlr") rebate requirements and premium taxes, the company recognized pre-tax income of $307 million in the company's gaap consolidated statement of operations within the health care benefits segment.

commentary - 2022 compared to 2021
revenues
•total revenues increased $9.2 billion, or 11.2%, to $91.4 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 driven by growth across all product lines.
medical benefit ratio
•medical benefit ratio is calculated as benefit costs divided by premium revenues and represents the percentage of premium revenues spent on medical benefits for the company's insured members. management uses mbr to assess the underlying business performance and underwriting of its insurance products, understand variances between actual results and expected results and identify trends in period-over-period results. mbr provides management and investors with information useful in assessing the operating results of the company's insured health care benefits products.
•the mbr decreased from 85.0% to 84.0% in 2022 compared to the prior year primarily driven by the net favorable impact of covid-19 compared to the prior year, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the flu compared to the prior year.
loss on assets held for sale
•during 2022, the company recorded a $41 million loss on assets held for sale on its thailand business, which is included in the commercial business reporting unit within the health care benefits segment. see note 2 ''acquisitions, divestitures and asset sales'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information.
operating expenses
•operating expenses in the health care benefits segment include selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses.
•operating expenses increased $636 million, or 4.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased operating expenses to support the growth across all product lines described above, incremental investments in the business, as well as office real estate optimization charges recorded in 2022 in connection with the planned reduction of corporate office real estate space. these increases were partially offset by the pre-tax gains of $250 million on the sale of bswift and $225 million on the sale of payflex.
•operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 16.0% in 2022 compared to 17.0% in 2021. the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was primarily driven by the increases in total revenues described above and the pre-tax gains on the sales of bswift and payflex.
adjusted operating income
•adjusted operating income increased $972 million, or 19.4%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the net favorable impact of covid-19 compared to the prior year, strong underlying performance and membership growth. these increases were partially offset by incremental investments to support growth in the business, the unfavorable impact of the flu compared to the prior year and net realized capital losses.

•medical membership represents the number of members covered by the company's insured and asc medical products and related services at a specified point in time. management uses this metric to understand variances between actual medical membership and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. this metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of medical membership on segment total revenues and operating results.
•medical membership as of december 31, 2022 of 24.4 million increased 548,000 compared with december 31, 2021, reflecting increases in medicare and commercial membership, as underlying commercial growth more than offset the impact of international divestitures. these increases were partially offset by a decline in medicaid membership reflecting the previously disclosed loss of a large customer in the third quarter of 2022.
medicare update on april 4, 2022, the u.s. centers for medicare & medicaid services ("cms") issued its final notice detailing final 2023 medicare advantage payment rates. final 2023 medicare advantage rates resulted in an expected average increase in revenue for the medicare advantage industry of 5.00%, excluding the cms estimate of medicare advantage risk score trend. on february 1, 2023, cms issued an advance notice detailing proposed 2024 medicare advantage payment rates. the 2024 medicare advantage rates, if finalized as proposed, will result in an expected average decrease in revenue for the medicare advantage industry of 2.27%, excluding the cms estimate of medicare advantage risk score trend. cms intends to publish the final 2024 rate announcement no later than april 3, 2023.
the aca ties a portion of each medicare advantage plan's reimbursement to the plan's "star ratings." plans must have a star rating of four or higher (out of five) to qualify for bonus payments. cms released the company's 2023 star ratings in october 2022. the company's 2023 star ratings will be used to determine which of the company's medicare advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2024. based on the company's membership at december 31, 2022, 21% of the company's medicare advantage members were in plans with 2023 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 87% of the company's medicare advantage members being in plans with 2022 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on the company's membership at december 31, 2021.

commentary - 2022 compared to 2021
revenues
•total revenues increased $16.2 billion, or 10.6%, to $169.2 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase was primarily driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by continued client price improvements.
operating expenses
•operating expenses in the pharmacy services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.
•operating expenses increased $167 million, or 11.4%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase was primarily driven by restructuring and business integration costs recorded in 2022.
•operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2022 and 2021.
adjusted operating income
•adjusted operating income increased $497 million, or 7.2%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics, including increased contributions from the products and services of the company's group purchasing organization, partially offset by continued client price improvements.
•as you review the pharmacy services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:
•the company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. in particular, competitive pressures in the pbm industry have caused the company and other pbms to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. in addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network "differential" or "spread," and the company expects these trends to continue. the "differential" or "spread" is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including medicare part d plan sponsors, by a pbm and the price paid for the drug by the pbm to the dispensing provider.
pharmacy claims processed
•total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. this metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.
•the company's pharmacy network claims processed increased 4.7% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by net new business, increased utilization and the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season compared to the prior year. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in covid-19 vaccinations.
•the company's mail choice claims processed increased 0.7% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by net new business and the increased utilization of maintenance choice prescriptions.
•excluding the impact of covid-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 5.1% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2022 compared to the prior year.
generic dispensing rate
•generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the pharmacy services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. this metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.
•the pharmacy services segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 87.4% in 2022 compared to 86.8% in the prior year. the increase in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by a decrease in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to decreased covid-19 vaccinations in 2022 compared to the prior year. excluding the impact of covid-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate was 88.3% and 88.5% in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

commentary - 2022 compared to 2021
revenues
•total revenues increased $6.5 billion, or 6.5%, to $106.6 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase was primarily driven by increased prescription and front store volume, including the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season compared to the prior year and increased sales of covid-19 otc test kits in 2022 compared to 2021, as well as pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. these increases were partially offset by decreased covid-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the impact of recent generic introductions and continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.
•pharmacy same store sales increased 9.5% in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase was primarily driven by the 4.0% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season compared to the prior year, pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. these increases were partially offset by the impact of recent generic introductions and continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.
•front store same store sales increased 7.4% in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase was primarily due to strength in consumer health, including the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season compared to the prior year and increased sales of covid-19 otc test kits in 2022 compared to 2021.
•other revenues decreased 30.3% in 2022 compared to 2021. the decrease was primarily due to decreased covid-19 diagnostic testing in 2022 compared to the prior year.
loss on assets held for sale
•during 2022, the company recorded a loss on assets held for sale of approximately $2.5 billion related to the write-down of its ltc business. see note 2 ''acquisitions, divestitures and asset sales'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information.
store impairments
•during 2021, the company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. see note 6 ''leases'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information.
goodwill impairment
•during 2021, the company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge related to the ltc reporting unit within the retail/ltc segment. see note 5 ''goodwill and other intangibles'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information.
operating expenses
•operating expenses in the retail/ltc segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.
•operating expenses increased $478 million, or 2.4%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased volume, increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities, as well as decreased gains from legal settlements in 2022 compared to 2021. these increases were partially offset by lower expenses associated with covid-19 vaccination administration compared to the prior year and the favorable impact of business initiatives in 2022.
•operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 19.4% in 2022 compared to 20.1% in 2021. the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was primarily driven by the increases in total revenues described above.
adjusted operating income
•adjusted operating income decreased $918 million, or 12.0%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by decreased covid-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities and decreased gains from legal settlements in 2022 compared to 2021. these decreases were partially offset by the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drug purchasing and the favorable impact of business initiatives in 2022.
•as you review the retail/ltc segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:
•the segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, pbms and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the retail/ltc segment. if the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.
•the increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment's adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. this trend, which the company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.
prescriptions filled
•prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the retail/ltc segment's pharmacies. management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. this metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.
•prescriptions filled increased 2.3% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by increased utilization and the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season compared to the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in covid-19 vaccinations. excluding the impact of covid-19 vaccinations, prescriptions filled increased 4.4%, on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2022 compared to the prior year.
generic dispensing rate
•generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the retail/ltc segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. this metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.
•the retail/ltc segment's generic dispensing rate increased to 87.4% in 2022 compared to 85.7% in the prior year. the increase in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by a decrease in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to decreased covid-19 vaccinations in 2022 compared to the prior year. excluding the impact of covid-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate was 89.0% in both 2022 and 2021.

commentary - 2022 compared to 2021
revenues
•revenues primarily relate to products for which the company no longer solicits or accepts new customers, such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.
•total revenues decreased $191 million, or 26.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the decrease was primarily driven by net realized capital losses in 2022 compared to net realized capital gains in 2021 and lower net investment income from private equity investments, partially offset by higher average invested assets and favorable average investment yields in 2022 compared to 2021.
opioid litigation charges
•during 2022, the company recorded $5.8 billion of opioid litigation charges. see note 16 ''commitments and contingencies'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information.
adjusted operating loss
•adjusted operating loss increased $314 million, or 21.3%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase was primarily driven by the decreases in net investment income described above and the strengthening of reserves in the company's long-term care insurance business, which occurred during the second quarter of 2022.
liquidity and capital resources cash flows the company maintains a level of liquidity sufficient to allow it to meet its cash needs in the short-term. over the long term, the company manages its cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain its financial condition and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. the company continuously assesses its regulatory capital requirements, working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturity schedule, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions. the company believes its operating cash flows, commercial paper program, credit facilities, as well as any potential future borrowings, will be sufficient to fund these future payments and long-term initiatives. as of december 31, 2022, the company had approximately $12.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $5.4 billion of which was held by the parent company or nonrestricted subsidiaries.
the net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:

commentary - 2022 compared to 2021
•net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the timing of payments and higher inventory purchases.
•net cash used in investing activities decreased by $214 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to lower net purchases of investments and the gross proceeds from the divestitures of payflex and bswift, largely offset by a reduction in restricted cash as a result of the sale of health savings account funds held on behalf of customers in conjunction with the sale of payflex. in addition, cash used in investing activities reflected the following activity:
•gross capital expenditures remained relatively consistent at approximately $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. during 2022, approximately 73% of the company's total capital expenditures were for technology, digital and other strategic initiatives and 27% were for store, fulfillment and support facilities expansion and improvements.
•net cash used in financing activities decreased to $10.5 billion in 2022 compared to $11.4 billion in 2021. the decrease in cash used in financing activities primarily related to lower net repayments of long-term debt during 2022 compared to the prior year, partially offset by share repurchases in 2022.
included in net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was the following store development activity: (1)

see note 8 ''borrowings and credit agreements'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information about debt issuances and debt repayments.
derivative financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments in order to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk and credit exposure. the company's use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps.
debt covenants the company's back-up revolving credit facilities and unsecured senior notes (see note 8 ''borrowings and credit agreements'' included in item 8 of this 10-k) contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. these covenants do not include an acceleration of the company's debt maturities in the event of a downgrade in the company's credit ratings. the company does not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect its financial or operating flexibility. as of december 31, 2022, the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.
debt ratings as of december 31, 2022, the company's long-term debt was rated "baa2" by moody's investors service, inc. ("moody's") and "bbb" by standard & poor's financial services llc ("s&p"), and its commercial paper program was rated "p-2" by moody's and "a-2" by s&p. the outlook on the company's long-term debt is "stable" by moody's. in december 2022, s&p changed the outlook on the company's long-term debt from "positive" to "stable." in assessing the company's credit strength, the company believes that both moody's and s&p considered, among other things, the company's capital structure and financial policies as well as its consolidated balance sheet, its historical acquisition activity and other financial information. although the company currently believes its long-term debt ratings will remain investment grade, it cannot guarantee the future actions of moody's and/or s&p. the company's debt ratings have a direct impact on its future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs.
share repurchase programs the following share repurchase programs have been authorized by cvs health corporation's board of directors (the "board"):
the following share repurchase programs have been authorized by the board:
in billionsauthorization date                              authorized                  remaining as of december 31, 2022
november 17, 2022 ("2022 repurchase program")             $10.0                          $10.0
december 9, 2021 ("2021 repurchase program")               10.0                            6.5
each of the share repurchase programs was effective immediately and permit the company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ("asr") transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. both the 2022 and 2021 repurchase programs can be modified or terminated by the board at any time.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, the company repurchased an aggregate of 34.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $3.5 billion pursuant to the 2021 repurchase program, including share repurchases under the $1.5 billion fixed dollar asr transaction described below. during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, the company did not repurchase any shares of common stock.
pursuant to the authorization under the 2021 repurchase program, the company entered into a $2.0 billion fixed dollar asr with citibank, n.a. ("citibank"). upon payment of the $2.0 billion purchase price on january 4, 2023, the company received a number of shares of cvs health corporation's common stock equal to 80% of the $2.0 billion notional amount of the asr or approximately 17.4 million shares at a price of $92.19 per share, which were placed into treasury stock in january 2023. at the conclusion of the asr, the company may receive additional shares representing the remaining 20% of the $2.0 billion notional amount. the ultimate number of shares the company may receive will depend on the daily volume-weighted average price of the company's stock over an averaging period, less a discount. it is also possible, depending on such weighted average price, that the company will have an obligation to citibank which, at the company's option, could be settled in additional cash or by issuing shares. under the terms of the asr, the maximum number of shares that could be delivered to the company is 43.4 million.
pursuant to the authorization under the 2021 repurchase program, the company entered into a $1.5 billion fixed dollar asr with barclays bank plc. upon payment of the $1.5 billion purchase price on january 4, 2022, the company received a number of shares of cvs health corporation's common stock equal to 80% of the $1.5 billion notional amount of the asr or approximately 11.6 million shares at a price of $103.34 per share, which were placed into treasury stock in january 2022. the asr was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $1.2 billion and a forward contract for $0.3 billion. the forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus. in february 2022, the company received approximately 2.7 million shares of cvs health corporation's common stock, representing the remaining 20% of the $1.5 billion notional amount of the asr, thereby concluding the asr. these shares were placed into treasury stock and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in february 2022.
at the time they were received, the initial and final receipt of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.
dividends during 2022, 2021 and 2020 the quarterly cash dividend was $0.55, $0.50 and $0.50 per share, respectively. in december 2022, the board authorized a 10% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.605 per share effective in 2023. cvs health corporation has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a public company. future dividend payments will depend on the company's earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the board.
future cash requirements the following table summarizes certain estimated future cash requirements under the company's various contractual obligations at december 31, 2022, in total and disaggregated into current and long-term obligations. the table below does not include future payments of claims to health care providers or pharmacies because certain terms of these payments are not determinable at december 31, 2022 (for example, the timing and volume of future services provided under fee-for-service arrangements and future membership levels for capitated arrangements).

(2)the company leases pharmacy and clinic space from target. see note 6 ''leases'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information regarding the lease arrangements with target. amounts related to such operating and finance leases are reflected within the operating lease liabilities and finance lease liabilities in the table above. pharmacy lease amounts due in excess of the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings are reflected in the table above assuming equivalent stores continue to operate through the term of the arrangements.
(3)refer to note 8 ''borrowings and credit agreements'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information regarding the maturities of debt principal. interest payments on long-term debt are calculated using outstanding balances and interest rates in effect on december 31, 2022.
(4)refer to note 16 ''commitments and contingencies'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information regarding the opioid litigation settlement agreements.
(5)payments of other long-term liabilities exclude separate accounts liabilities of approximately $3.2 billion because these liabilities are supported by assets that are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the company's business.
(6)total payments of future policy benefits, unpaid claims and policyholders' funds include $705 million, $1.3 billion and $170 million, respectively, of reserves for contracts subject to reinsurance. the company expects the assuming reinsurance carrier to fund these obligations and has reflected these amounts as reinsurance recoverable assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
(7)customer funds associated with group life and health contracts of approximately $107 million have been excluded from the table above because such funds may be used primarily at the customer's discretion to offset future premiums and/or for refunds, and the timing of the related cash flows cannot be determined. additionally, net unrealized capital losses on debt securities supporting experience-rated products of $56 million, before tax, have been excluded from the table above.
restrictions on certain payments in addition to general state law restrictions on payments of dividends and other distributions to stockholders applicable to all corporations, health maintenance organizations ("hmos") and insurance companies are subject to further regulations that, among other things, may require those companies to maintain certain levels of equity (referred to as surplus) and restrict the amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their equity holders. these regulations are not directly applicable to cvs health corporation as a holding company, since cvs health corporation is not an hmo or an insurance company. in addition, in connection with the aetna acquisition, the company made certain undertakings that require prior regulatory approval of dividends by certain of its hmos and insurance companies. the additional regulations and undertakings applicable to the company's hmo and insurance company subsidiaries are not expected to affect the company's ability to service the company's debt, meet other financing obligations or pay dividends, or the ability of any of the company's subsidiaries to service their debt or other financing obligations. under applicable regulatory requirements and undertakings, at december 31, 2022, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by the company's insurance and hmo subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities was $2.7 billion in the aggregate.
the company maintains capital levels in its operating subsidiaries at or above targeted and/or required capital levels and dividends amounts in excess of these levels to meet liquidity requirements, including the payment of interest on debt and stockholder dividends. in addition, at the company's discretion, it uses these funds for other purposes such as funding share and debt repurchase programs, investments in new businesses and other purposes considered advisable.
at december 31, 2022 and 2021, the company held investments of $331 million and $450 million, respectively, that are not accounted for as separate accounts assets but are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the company's business. see note 3 ''investments'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information on investments related to the 2012 conversion of an existing group annuity contract from a participating to a non-participating contract.
solvency regulation the national association of insurance commissioners (the "naic") utilizes risk-based capital ("rbc") standards for insurance companies that are designed to identify weakly-capitalized companies by comparing each company's adjusted surplus to its required surplus (the "rbc ratio"). the rbc ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of insurance companies. within certain ratio ranges, regulators have increasing authority to take action as the rbc ratio decreases. there are four levels of regulatory action, ranging from requiring an insurer to submit a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its rbc to the state insurance commissioner to requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control. at december 31, 2022, the rbc ratio of each of the company's primary insurance subsidiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action. the rbc framework described above for insurers has been extended by the naic to health organizations, including hmos. although not all states had adopted these rules at december 31, 2022, at that date, each of the company's active hmos had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or, where adopted, the levels that would require regulatory action under the naic's rbc rules. external rating agencies use their own capital models and/or rbc standards when they determine a company's rating.
critical accounting policies the company prepares the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make certain estimates and apply judgment. estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. on a regular basis, the company reviews its accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. while the company believes the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered by management support the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from estimates, and such differences could be material.
significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 ''significant accounting policies'' included in item 8 of this 10-k. management believes the following accounting policies include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity and, thus, are considered to be critical accounting policies. the company has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board (the "audit committee"), and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures relating to them.
revenue recognition health care benefits segment health care benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. revenue is recognized based on customer billings, which, in the company's commercial business, reflect contracted rates per member and the number of covered members recorded in the company's records at the time the billings are prepared. billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month. revenue related to the company's government business is collected monthly from the u.s. federal government and various government agencies based on fixed payment rates and member eligibility.
the company's billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors. these adjustments are known as retroactivity adjustments. in each period, the company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. as information regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known, the company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the period in which they arise. a significant difference in the actual level of retroactivity compared to estimated levels would have a significant effect on the company's operating results.
premium revenue premiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. premiums are reported net of an allowance for estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts. additionally, premium revenue subject to the mlr rebate requirements of the aca is recorded net of the estimated minimum mlr rebates for the current calendar year. premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned premiums) are reported as other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.
some of the company's contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of insured members. such adjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer emerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.
services revenue services revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. the health care benefits segment's services revenue primarily consists of asc fees received in exchange for performing certain claim processing and member services for asc members. asc fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. some of the company's administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim processing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor's benefit claim experience will fall within a certain range. with any of these guarantees, the company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk typically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the company by the customer involved. each period the company estimates its obligations under the terms of these guarantees and records its estimate as an offset to services revenues.
accounting for medicare part d revenues include insurance premiums earned by the company's pdps, which are determined based on the pdp's annual bid and related contractual arrangements with cms. the insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the pdp member, and can be subsidized by cms in the case of low-income members, and a direct premium paid by cms. premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.
revenues also include a risk-sharing feature of the medicare part d program design referred to as the risk corridor. the company estimates variable consideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, cms under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional subsidies to be received from or owed to cms at the end of the reporting year.
in addition to medicare part d premiums, the company receives additional payments each month from cms related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income cost-sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits. if the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.
pharmacy services segment the pharmacy services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the company's retail pharmacy network. the company's pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no contractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time. pbm services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the dispensing of prescription drugs.
the company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the company has concluded it controls the prescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members. the company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy network because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related pbm services.
revenues include (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts and refunds paid back to the client (see "drug discounts" and "guarantees" below), (ii) the price paid to the company by client plan members for mail order prescriptions and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions ("retail co-payments"), and (iii) claims based administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts. sales taxes are not included in revenues.
the company recognizes revenue when control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs. the company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the pharmacy services segment:
•revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the client plan member. at the time of delivery, the company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.
•revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the company's retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the company's point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the company's online claims processing system and the company has transferred control of the prescription drug and completed all of its performance obligations.
for contracts under which the company acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is recognized using the net method.
drug discounts the company records revenue net of manufacturers' rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members' utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. the company estimates these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers' rebates earned by its clients. the estimates are based on the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. the company adjusts its rebates payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recorded against revenues at the time it is identified. adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebate adjustments, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates, or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicable formulary. the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers' rebate amounts has not been material to the company's operating results or financial condition.
guarantees the company also adjusts revenues for refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performance metrics. the inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the company's operating results or financial condition.
retail/ltc segment retail pharmacy the company's retail drugstores recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. for pharmacy sales, each prescription claim is its own arrangement with the customer and is a performance obligation, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under other retail network arrangements. revenues are adjusted for refunds owed to third party payers resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined value-based service and performance metrics. the inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the company's operating results or financial condition.
revenue from company gift cards purchased by customers is deferred as a contract liability until goods or services are transferred. any amounts not expected to be redeemed by customers (i.e., breakage) are recognized based on historical redemption patterns.
customer returns are not material to the company's operating results or financial condition. sales taxes are not included in revenues.
loyalty and other programs the company's customer loyalty program, extracare®, consists of two components, extrasavingstm and extrabucks® rewards. extrasavings are coupons that are recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed as the company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional goods or services at the time of issuance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level.
extrabucks rewards are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels. thus, the company has determined that there is an additional performance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction. the company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the extrabucks rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards. revenue allocated to extrabucks rewards is recognized as those rewards are redeemed. at the end of each period, unredeemed extrabucks rewards are reflected as a contract liability.
the company also offers a subscription-based membership program, carepass®, under which members are entitled to a suite of benefits delivered over the course of the subscription period, as well as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services. subscriptions are paid for on a monthly or annual basis at the time of or in advance of the company delivering the goods and services. revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied.
long-term care revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. each prescription claim represents a separate performance obligation of the company, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under customer arrangements. a significant portion of long-term care revenue from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products is reimbursed by the federal medicare part d program and, to a lesser extent, state medicaid programs. the company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources, as well as long-term care facilities and other third party insurance payors, and reduces revenue at the revenue recognition date to properly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. accordingly, the total revenues and receivables reported in the company's consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors.
patient co-payments associated with medicare part d, certain state medicaid programs, medicare part b and certain third party payors typically are not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of normal billing procedures and subject to normal accounts receivable collections procedures.
walk-in medical clinics for services provided by the company's walk-in medical clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments taken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates.
impairments of debt securities the company regularly reviews its debt securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. if a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in net income. if a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related (yield-related) components. the amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income (loss). the company analyzes all facts and circumstances believed to be relevant for each investment when performing this analysis, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.
in evaluating whether a credit related loss exists, the company considers a variety of factors including: the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the issuer of a security, an industry or geographic area; the payment structure of the security; the failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principle payments; and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency.
among the factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred are whether the decline results from a change in the quality of the debt security itself, whether the decline results from a downward movement in the market as a whole, and the prospects for realizing the carrying value of the debt security based on the investment's current and short-term prospects for recovery. for unrealized losses determined to be the result of market conditions (for example, increasing interest rates and volatility due to conditions in the overall market) or industry-related events, the company determines whether it intends to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the debt security prior to the anticipated recovery of the debt security's amortized cost basis. if either case is true, the company recognizes a non-credit related impairment, and the cost basis or carrying amount of the debt security is written down to fair value.
during the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the company recorded yield-related impairment losses on debt securities of $143 million, $42 million and $49 million, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2022, the company recorded credit-related losses on debt securities of $13 million. during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, the company did not record any credit-related impairment losses on debt securities.
the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of a debt security include the risk that market factors may differ from projections and the risk that facts and circumstances factored into the company's assessment may change with the passage of time. unexpected changes to market factors and circumstances that were not present in past reporting periods are among the factors that may result in a current period decision to sell debt securities that were not impaired in prior reporting periods.
vendor allowances and purchase discounts vendor and manufacturer receivables were $12.4 billion and $10.6 billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the majority of which relate to purchase discounts and vendor allowances as described below.
pharmacy services segment the pharmacy services segment receives purchase discounts on products purchased. contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies, normally provide for the pharmacy services segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, of the following forms: (i) a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or (iii) when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. these rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter. historically, the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the company's operating results or financial condition. the company accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed. the pharmacy services segment also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined purchase volumes. in addition, the pharmacy services segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold.
retail/ltc segment vendor allowances received by the retail/ltc segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold, unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the related advertising commitment is satisfied. any such allowances received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. the total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. the deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold over the life of the contract based upon sales volume. the total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred. the deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold on a straight-line basis over the life of the related contract.
the company establishes a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on historical trends and data. the majority of vendor receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter. historically, adjustments to the company's vendor receivables resulting from the reconciliation of receivables recognized to the amounts collected have not been material to the company's operating results or financial condition.
there have not been any material changes in the way the company accounts for vendor allowances or purchase discounts during the past three years.
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method.
the value of ending inventory is reduced for estimated inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each retail store and ltc pharmacy, and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated. the company's accounting for inventory contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. when estimating these losses, a number of factors are considered which include historical physical inventory results on a location-by-location basis and current physical inventory loss trends.
the total reserve for estimated inventory losses covered by this critical accounting policy was $559 million and $522 million as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. although management believes there is sufficient current and historical information available to record reasonable estimates for estimated inventory losses, it is possible that actual results could differ. in order to help investors assess the aggregate risk, if any, associated with the inventory-related uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in estimated inventory losses, which is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease the total reserve for estimated inventory losses by approximately $56 million as of december 31, 2022.
although management believes that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from such estimates, and such differences could be material.
right-of-use assets and lease liabilities the company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. right-of-use assets represent the company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. as the interest rate implicit in the company's leases is not readily determinable, the company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. the operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives. the company evaluates the recoverability of its right-of-use assets as described in "recoverability of long-lived assets" below.
the company's real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. for real estate leases, the options to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. generally, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.
for real estate leases, the company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. these fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.
recoverability of long-lived assets recoverability of definite-lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. the company groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. if indicators of impairment are present, the company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). if the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted). if required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group's carrying value that exceeds the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted).
the long-lived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group's future sales, profitability and cash flows. when preparing these estimates, the company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions, efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns.
during the fourth quarter of 2022, the company undertook an initiative to evaluate its corporate office real estate space in response to its new flexible work arrangement. as part of this initiative, the company evaluated its current real estate space and changes in employee work arrangement requirements to ensure it had the appropriate space to support the business. as a result of this assessment, the company determined that it would vacate and abandon certain leased corporate office spaces. accordingly, in the three months ended december 31, 2022, the company recorded office real estate optimization charges of $117 million, primarily consisting of $71 million related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $44 million related to property and equipment, within the health care benefits, corporate/other and pharmacy services segments.
during the fourth quarter of 2021, the company completed a strategic review of its retail business and announced the creation of new formats for its stores to continue to drive higher engagement with customers. as part of this review, the company evaluated changes in population, consumer buying patterns and future health needs to ensure it has the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers and for the business. in connection with this initiative, on november 17, 2021, the board authorized the closing of approximately 900 retail stores, approximately 300 stores each year, between 2022 and 2024. as a result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted stores' asset groups, including the associated operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. a long-lived asset impairment test was performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the results of the impairment test indicated that the fair value of certain retail store asset groups was lower than their respective carrying values. accordingly, in the three months ended december 31, 2021, the company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion, consisting of a write down of approximately
$1.1 billion related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $261 million related to property and equipment, within the retail/ltc segment.
there were no material impairment charges recognized on long-lived assets during the year ended december 31, 2020.
recoverability of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis. the impairment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit's fair value with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. the fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. if the net book value (carrying amount) of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered to be impaired, and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates. these assumptions and estimates primarily include the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the company competes; discount rates; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, capital expenditures and future working capital requirements. when determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, the company considers each reporting unit's historical results and current operating trends; consolidated revenues, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts; and industry trends. the company's estimates can be affected by a number of factors, including general economic and regulatory conditions; the risk-free interest rate environment; the company's market capitalization; efforts of customers and payers to reduce costs, including their prescription drug costs, and/or increase member co-payments; the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share, consumer spending patterns and the company's ability to achieve its revenue growth projections and execute on its cost reduction initiatives.
2022 goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2022, the company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. the results of the impairment tests indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. the fair values of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values by significant margins.
subsequent to the closing date of the aetna acquisition in november 2018, the company had experienced declines in its commercial insured medical membership. in 2022, the company has grown its commercial insured medical membership, excluding the impact of the divestiture of the thailand business described in note 2 ''acquisitions, divestitures and asset sales'' included in item 8 of this 10-k. adverse economic conditions may impact medical membership in the commercial business due to reductions in workforce at existing customers. the company's fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions including changes in medical membership, revenue growth rate, operating income and the discount rate. the company believes the financial projections used to determine the fair value of the commercial business reporting unit in the third quarter of 2022 were reasonable and achievable. as of december 31, 2022, the goodwill balance in the commercial business reporting unit was $25.5 billion.
2021 goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2021, the company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill. the results of the impairment tests indicated an impairment of the goodwill associated with the ltc reporting unit, as the reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the testing date. the results of the impairment tests of the remaining reporting units indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. the fair values of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values by significant margins, with the exception of the commercial business reporting unit, which exceeded its carrying value by approximately 3%.
as discussed in note 5 ''goodwill and other intangibles'' included in item 8 of this 10-k, during 2021, the ltc reporting unit has continued to face challenges that have impacted the company's ability to grow the ltc reporting unit's business at the rate estimated when its 2020 goodwill impairment test was performed. these challenges include lower net facility admissions, net long-term care facility customer losses and the prolonged adverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic and the emerging new variants, which resulted in more significant declines in occupancy rates experienced by the company's long-term care facility customers than previously anticipated. during the third quarter of 2021, ltc management updated their 2021 annual forecast and submitted their long-term plan which showed deterioration in the financial results for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. the company utilized these updated projections in performing its annual impairment test, which indicated that the fair value of the ltc reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a $431 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2021. the fair value of the ltc reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. subsequent to the impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2021, there is no remaining goodwill balance in the ltc reporting unit.
2020 goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2020, the company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. the results of this impairment test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. the goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the company's reporting units exceeding their carrying values by significant margins, with the exception of the commercial business and ltc reporting units, which exceeded their carrying values by approximately 6% and 12%, respectively.
recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate fair value based on the assumption that, in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset, the company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset. fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset. these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions, availability of market information and the profitability of the company. there were no impairment losses recognized on indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.
health care costs payable at both december 31, 2022 and 2021, 75% of health care costs payable are estimates of the ultimate cost of (i) services rendered to the company's insured members but not yet reported to the company and (ii) claims which have been reported to the company but not yet paid (collectively, "ibnr"). health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. the remainder of health care costs payable is primarily comprised of pharmacy and capitation payables, other amounts due to providers pursuant to risk sharing agreements and accruals for state assessments. the company develops its estimate of ibnr using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors. see note 1 ''significant accounting policies'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information on the company's reserving methodology.
during 2022 and 2021, the company observed an increase in completion factors relative to those assumed at the prior year end. after considering the claims paid in 2022 and 2021 with dates of service prior to the fourth quarter of the previous year, the company observed assumed incurred claim weighted average completion factors that were 3 and 21 basis points higher, respectively, than previously estimated, resulting in a decrease of $32 million and $207 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to the prior year. the company has considered the pattern of changes in its completion factors when determining the completion factors used in its estimates of ibnr as of december 31, 2022. however, based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the company's estimated weighted average completion factors may vary by plus or minus 12 basis points from the company's assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by approximately plus or minus $207 million pretax.
also, during 2022 and 2021, the company observed that health care costs for claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statement date were lower than previously estimated. specifically, after considering the claims paid in 2022 and 2021 with claim incurred dates for the fourth quarter of the previous year, the company observed health care costs that were 4.8% and 5.0% lower, respectively, for each fourth quarter than previously estimated, resulting in a reduction of $622 million and $581 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to prior year.
management considers historical health care cost trend rates together with its knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends when developing estimates of current health care cost trend rates. when establishing reserves as of december 31, 2022, the company increased its assumed health care cost trend rates for the most recent three months by 4.9% from health care cost trend rates recently observed. health care cost trend rates during the past three years have been impacted by utilization changes driven by the covid-19 pandemic. the impact has not been uniform, with products and select geographies experiencing utilization impacts due to covid-19 waves. based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the company's estimated health care cost trend rates may vary by plus or minus 3.5% from the assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by plus or minus $487 million pretax.
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are adjusted as needed to reflect changes in the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. such adjustments are recorded in the period in which changes in tax laws are enacted, regardless of when they are effective. deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those losses, deductions or other tax benefits is sufficiently uncertain.
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since, in the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. additionally, the company's tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments based on differing interpretations of the tax laws. although management believes that its estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time the provision is prepared, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the related tax authority. interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the income tax provision. significant judgment is required in determining uncertain tax positions. the company has established accruals for uncertain tax positions using its judgment and adjusts these accruals, as warranted, due to changing facts and circumstances.
new accounting pronouncements see note 1 ''significant accounting policies'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for a description of new accounting pronouncements applicable to the company.

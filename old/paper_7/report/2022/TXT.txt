item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in 2022, textron's revenues increased 4% and segment profit increased 8%, compared with 2021, reflecting the impact of higher pricing and higher volume and mix at both the textron aviation and industrial segments, partially offset by lower volume and mix at the bell and textron systems segments. our backlog increased 31%, to $13.3 billion by the end of 2022, reflecting increased demand in many of our businesses, including a 55% increase in backlog at the textron aviation segment. during 2022, we continued to manage through the impacts of ongoing global supply chain shortages/delays and labor shortages, in order to meet customer demand. in december 2022, bell was awarded the development contract for the u.s. army's future long-range assault aircraft (flraa) program as discussed in item 1. business. financial highlights for 2022 also include:
•generated $1.5 billion of net cash from operating activities from our manufacturing businesses.
•invested $601 million in research and development projects and $354 million in capital expenditures.
•returned $867 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 13.1 million shares of our common stock.

revenues revenues increased $487 million, 4%, in 2022, compared with 2021. the revenue increase primarily included the following factors:
•higher textron aviation revenues of $507 million, reflecting higher volume and mix of $302 million and higher pricing of $205 million.
•higher industrial revenues of $335 million due to a favorable impact from pricing of $227 million, principally in the specialized vehicles product line, and higher volume and mix of $203 million in both product lines, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from exchange rate fluctuations of $95 million.
•lower bell revenues of $273 million due to lower military revenues of $333 million, primarily in the h-1 program due to lower aircraft and spares production volume reflecting lower demand, partially offset by higher commercial revenues of $60 million, largely due to higher pricing.
•lower textron systems revenues of $101 million, largely due to lower volume of $121 million, which included an $88 million decrease from our afghanistan fee-for-service and aircraft support contracts.
cost of sales and selling and administrative expense cost of sales includes cost of products and services sold for the manufacturing group. in 2022, cost of sales increased $503 million, 5%, compared with 2021, largely due to an unfavorable impact from inflation of $385 million, principally reflecting higher material costs in the industrial and textron aviation segments. gross margin as a percentage of manufacturing revenues decreased 80 basis points in 2022, compared with 2021, as higher margin at the textron aviation segment, reflecting higher volume and mix and pricing, was more than offset by lower margin at the other manufacturing segments, primarily at the bell segment due to lower volume and mix.
selling and administrative expense decreased $35 million, 3%, in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily reflecting lower share-based compensation expense.
interest expense, net interest expense, net includes interest expense for both the finance and manufacturing borrowing groups, with interest on intercompany borrowings eliminated, and interest income earned on cash and equivalents. in 2022, interest expense, net decreased $35 million, 25%, compared with 2021, primarily due to an increase in interest income of $22 million and lower average debt outstanding. for 2022, 2021 and 2020, gross interest expense totaled $129 million, $142 million and $166 million, respectively.
non-service components of pension and postretirement income, net non-service components of pension and postretirement income, net increased by $81 million, 51%, in 2022, compared with 2021. the increase is based on our annual valuation at the end of 2021 and is primarily driven by an increase in the discount rate utilized for our domestic qualified pension plans and the impact of actual pension asset returns that exceeded our expected return on plan assets.
special charges special charges of $25 million in 2021, primarily include restructuring activities as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. there were no special charges recorded in 2022.

effective tax rate             15.2%       14.4%         (9.6%)
in 2022, the effective tax rate of 15.2% was lower than the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, largely due to the favorable impact of research and development credits and tax deductions for foreign-derived intangible income. in 2021, the effective tax rate of 14.4% was lower than the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, largely due to the favorable impact of research and development credits, which included a $12 million benefit recognized for additional credits related to prior years.
for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory tax rate, see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
segment analysis we conduct our business through six operating segments: textron aviation, bell, textron systems, industrial and textron eaviation, which represent our manufacturing businesses, and finance, which represents our captive finance business. segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision-making purposes. segment profit for the manufacturing segments includes non-service components of net periodic benefit cost/(income) and excludes interest expense, net; certain corporate expenses; gains/losses on major business dispositions; special charges; and an inventory charge related to the 2020 covid-19 restructuring plan, as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest income and expense. operating expenses for the manufacturing segments include cost of sales, selling and administrative expense and other non-service components of net periodic benefit cost/(income), and exclude certain corporate expenses and special charges.
in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group, changes in revenues and segment profit for our commercial businesses typically are expressed in terms of volume and mix, pricing, foreign exchange, acquisitions and dispositions, inflation and performance. for revenues, volume and mix represents changes in revenues from increases or decreases in the number of units delivered or services provided and the composition of products and/or services sold. for segment profit, volume and mix represents a change due to the number of units delivered or services provided and the composition of products and/or services sold at different profit margins. pricing represents changes in unit pricing. foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreign-denominated amounts into u.s. dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period. revenues generated by acquired businesses are reflected in acquisitions for a twelve-month period, while reductions in revenues and segment profit from the sale of businesses are reflected as dispositions. inflation represents higher material, wages, benefits, pension service cost or other costs. performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development, depreciation, selling and administrative costs, warranty, product liability, quality/scrap, labor efficiency, overhead, non-service pension cost/(income), product line profitability, start-up, ramp up and cost-reduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs.
approximately 22% of our 2022 revenues were derived from contracts with the u.s. government, including those under the u.s. government-sponsored foreign military sales program. for our segments that contract with the u.s. government, changes in revenues related to these contracts are expressed in terms of volume. changes in segment profit for these contracts are typically expressed in terms of volume and mix and performance; these include cumulative catch-up adjustments associated with a) revisions to the transaction price that may reflect contract modifications or changes in assumptions related to award fees and other variable consideration or b) changes in the total estimated costs at completion due to improved or deteriorated operating performance.

liquidity and capital resources our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups. the manufacturing group consists of textron consolidated with its majority-owned subsidiaries that operate in the textron aviation, bell, textron systems, industrial and textron eaviation segments. the finance group, which also is the finance segment, consists of textron financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group. our manufacturing group operations include the development, production and delivery of tangible products and services, while our finance group provides financial services. due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group's activities, investors, rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group's performance. to support those evaluations, we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements.
assessment of liquidity and significant future cash requirements key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below:

we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing (i.e., leverage) that is in place to support our capital structure, as well as to provide an indication of our capacity to add further leverage.
we expect to have sufficient cash to meet our needs based on our existing cash balances, the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations and the availability of our existing credit facility. in addition to our manufacturing operating cash requirements, future material cash outlays include our contractual combined debt and interest payments for the manufacturing group of $119 million in 2023, $461 million in 2024, $446 million in 2025 and $2.7 billion thereafter, and for the finance group of $35 million in 2023, $32 million in 2024, $49 million in 2025 and $611 million thereafter.
for the manufacturing group, we also have purchase obligations that require material future cash outlays totaling $2.9 billion in 2023, $383 million in 2024 and $149 million thereafter. purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price, quantity and delivery dates, as well as property, plant and equipment. approximately 18% of our purchase obligations represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the u.s. government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses.
effective at the beginning of 2022, the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years. without the option to deduct these expenses in the year incurred, our tax payments increased by $284 million in 2022. under the assumption that this legislation is not modified or repealed, the impact will continue over the five-year amortization period, but will decrease each year.
credit facilities and other sources of capital on october 21, 2022, textron entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, of which $100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. we may elect to increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the facility to up to $1.3 billion by designating an additional lender or by an existing lender agreeing to increase its commitment. the facility expires in october 2027 and provides for two one-year extensions at our option with the consent of lenders representing a majority of the commitments under the facility. this new facility replaces the existing 5-year facility, which was scheduled to expire in october 2024. at december 31, 2022 and january 1, 2022, there were no amounts borrowed against either facility. at december 31, 2022, there were $9 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the new facility, and at january 1, 2022, there were $9 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the prior facility.
we also maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities.
manufacturing group cash flows cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized below:
(in millions)                       2022            2021          2020

financing activities           (875)         (1,349)           393
cash flows from operating activities in 2022 were essentially unchanged from 2021 as an increase in net income tax payments of $260 million, largely resulting from a change in tax legislation discussed above, was mostly offset by changes in working capital and higher earnings. net income tax payments were $332 million and $72 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. pension contributions were $49 million and $52 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
in 2022 and 2021, investing cash flows primarily included capital expenditures of $354 million and $375 million, respectively. investing cash flows in 2022 also included $202 million of net cash paid for business acquisitions, largely related to the pipistrel acquisition discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
cash flows used by financing activities in 2022 included $867 million of cash paid to repurchase an aggregate of 13.1 million shares of our common stock under the 2022 share repurchase plan described below. in 2021, cash flows used by financing activities included $921 million of cash paid to repurchase an aggregate of 13.5 million shares of our common stock under a 2020 share repurchase plan, and $524 million of payments on long-term debt.
on january 25, 2022, we announced the authorization of the repurchase of up to 25 million shares of our common stock. this plan allows us to continue our practice of repurchasing shares to offset the impact of dilution from stock-based compensation and benefit plans and for opportunistic capital management purposes. the 2022 plan has no expiration date and replaced the prior 2020 share repurchase authorization, which was utilized in 2021 for repurchases.
dividend payments to shareholders totaled $17 million and $18 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
finance group cash flows the cash flows from continuing operations for the finance group as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized below:
(in millions)                     2022          2021          2020

financing activities         (216)          (97)          (33)
the finance group's cash flows from investing activities primarily included collections on finance receivables totaling $147 million and $250 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, partially offset by finance receivable originations of $92 million and $100 million, respectively. cash flows provided by investing activities in 2022 also included $45 million of other investing activities, largely related to proceeds from the sale of operating lease assets. cash flows used in financing activities included payments on long-term and nonrecourse debt of $216 million and $97 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
consolidated cash flows the consolidated cash flows from continuing operations, after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups, are summarized below:
(in millions)                       2022            2021          2020
operating activities          $1,490          $1,599          $769

financing activities         (1,091)         (1,446)           360
consolidated cash flows from operating activities were $1,490 million in 2022, compared with $1,599 million in 2021. the $109 million year-over-year decrease in net cash inflow was primarily due to an increase in net income tax payments of $263 million, largely resulting from a change in tax legislation discussed above, and a decrease in cash inflows from captive finance receivables of $96 million, partially offset changes in working capital and higher earnings. net income tax payments were $356 million and $93 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. pension contributions were $49 million and $52 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
in 2022 and 2021, investing cash flows included capital expenditures of $354 million and $375 million, respectively. investing cash flows in 2022 also included $202 million of net cash paid for business acquisitions, largely related to the pipistrel acquisition.
cash flows used by financing activities in 2022 primarily included $867 million of share repurchases and $234 million of payments on long-term debt. in 2021, cash flows used by financing activities included $921 million of share repurchases and $621 million of payments on long-term debt.
captive financing and other intercompany transactions the finance group provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and pre-owned textron aviation aircraft and bell helicopters manufactured by our manufacturing group, otherwise known as captive financing. in the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash received from customers is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties. however, in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups, cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group. for example, when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group, the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group's statement of cash flows. meanwhile, in the manufacturing group's statement of cash flows, the cash received from the finance group on the customer's behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow. although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups, there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing. these captive financing activities, along with all significant intercompany transactions, are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows.

under a support agreement between textron and tfc, textron is required to maintain a controlling interest in tfc. the agreement, as amended in december 2015, also requires textron to ensure that tfc maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125% and consolidated shareholders' equity of no less than $125 million. there were no cash contributions required to be paid to tfc in 2022 and 2021 to maintain compliance with the support agreement.
critical accounting estimates to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies. the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below. we believe these policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, which includes other significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition a substantial portion of our revenues is related to long-term contracts with the u.s. government, including those under the u.s. government-sponsored foreign military sales program, for the design, development, manufacture or modification of aerospace and defense products as well as related services. we generally use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress for these contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. under this measure, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation, and revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred.
due to the number of years it may take to complete these contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on the contracts, the estimation of total transaction price and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and, accordingly, is subject to change. in estimating total costs at completion, we are required to make numerous assumptions related to the complexity of design and related development work to be performed; engineering requirements; product performance; subcontractor performance; availability and cost of materials; labor productivity, availability and cost; overhead and capital costs; manufacturing efficiencies; the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials); and costs of satisfying offset obligations, among other variables. our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals. we review and update our cost projections quarterly or more frequently when circumstances significantly change. when our estimate of the total costs to be incurred on a contract exceeds the estimated total transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
at the outset of each contract, we estimate an initial profit booking rate considering the risks surrounding our ability to achieve the technical requirements (e.g., a newly developed product versus a mature product), schedule (e.g., the number and type of milestone events), and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion. profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. conversely, the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks; and, as a result, our estimated costs at completion increase. all estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and, therefore, may affect the profit booking rate.
changes in our estimate of the total expected cost or in the transaction price for a contract typically impact our profit booking rate. we utilize the cumulative catch-up method of accounting to recognize the impact of these changes on our profit booking rate for a contract. under this method, the inception-to-date impact of a profit adjustment on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. the impact of our cumulative catch-up adjustments on segment profit recognized in prior periods is presented below:

net adjustments           $(16)           $81           $72
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different revenues and/or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if (a) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment, (b) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation, (c) there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or (d) we are unable to meet contract milestones.
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment of a reporting unit. we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit using discounted cash flows. these cash flows incorporate assumptions for revenue growth rates and operating margins that are based on our strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts, which include our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions, cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions. the long-term revenue growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate, as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product, inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve. the discount rates utilized in this analysis are based on each reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed.
based on our annual impairment review, the fair value calculated using the estimates discussed above exceeded the carrying value by an adequate amount for each reporting group. accordingly, we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the impairment test in the foreseeable future.
retirement benefits we sponsor funded and unfunded domestic and international pension plans for certain of our employees. beginning on january 1, 2010, we initiated actions to commence the closure of the pension plans to new entrants. we provide employees hired subsequent to these closures with defined contribution benefits. our pension benefit obligations are calculated based on actuarial valuations. key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses or benefits include the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates. we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increases. we evaluate and update these assumptions annually.
to determine the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will decrease pension income. for both 2022 and 2021, the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension income was 7.10%. for 2022, the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans, which represent approximately 91% of our total pension assets, was 7.25%.
the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date, reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. this rate should be in line with rates for high-quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits, which fluctuate as long-term interest rates change. a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and decreases pension income. in 2022, the weighted-average discount rate used in calculating pension income was 2.99%, compared with 2.62% in 2021. for our domestic plans, the assumed discount rate was 3.05% in 2022, compared with 2.70% in 2021. a decrease of 50 basis-points in this weighted-average discount rate in 2022 would have decreased pension income for our domestic plans by approximately $20 million.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information set forth in this item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations. this section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. for a discussion of the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, please refer to part ii, item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021 filed with the sec on february 9, 2022.
we will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order:
•market trends and uncertainties
•overview of transactions
•dividends

•liquidity and capital resources
•non-gaap financial measures reconciliations
•critical accounting estimates
•recent accounting pronouncements market trends and uncertainties our operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by global and national economic and market conditions generally and by the local economic conditions where our properties are located, as well as by the covid pandemic.
rising interest rates, high inflation, supply chain disruptions, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and increased volatility in public equity and fixed income markets have led to increased costs and limited the availability of capital. to the extent our tenants or operators experience increased costs or financing difficulties due to the foregoing macroeconomic conditions, they may be unable or unwilling to make payments or perform their obligations when due. in addition, increased interest rates could affect our borrowing costs and the fair value of our fixed rate instruments.
we have also been affected by significant inflation in construction costs over the past couple of years, which, together with rising costs of capital, have negatively affected the expected yields on our development and redevelopment projects. in addition, labor shortages and global supply chain disruptions, including procurement delays and long lead times on certain materials, have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact the scheduled completion and/or costs of these projects.
further, the full, long-term economic impact of the covid pandemic on the operations of our ccrcs and the senior housing facilities owned by our swf sh jv remains uncertain. many factors cannot be predicted and will remain unpredictable, including the impact, duration, and severity of new variants and outbreaks. due to these uncertainties, at this time, we are not able to estimate the full impact of covid on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in the future.
we continuously monitor the effects of domestic and global events, including but not limited to inflation, labor shortages, supply chain matters, rising interest rates, and other current and expected impacts of the covid pandemic on our operations and financial position, as well as on the operations and financial position of our tenants, operators, and borrowers, to ensure that we remain responsive and adaptable to the dynamic changes in our operating environment.
see "item 1a, risk factors" in this report for additional discussion of the risks posed by macroeconomic conditions and the covid pandemic, as well as the uncertainties we and our tenants, operators, and borrowers may face as a result.

results of operations we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our reportable business segments: (i) life science, (ii) medical office, and (iii) ccrc. under the life science and medical office segments, we invest through the acquisition, development, and management of life science facilities, mobs, and hospitals, which generally requires a greater level of property management. our ccrcs are operated through ridea structures. we have other non-reportable segments that are comprised primarily of: (i) an interest in our unconsolidated swf sh jv, (ii) loans receivable, and (iii) marketable debt securities. we evaluate performance based upon property adjusted net operating income ("adjusted noi" or "cash noi") in each segment. the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
non-gaap financial measures net operating income noi and adjusted noi are non-u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate. noi is defined as real estate revenues (inclusive of rental and related revenues, resident fees and services, income from direct financing leases, and government grant income and exclusive of interest income), less property level operating expenses; noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income (loss) as presented in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, dfl non-cash interest, amortization of market lease intangibles, termination fees, actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported, and the impact of deferred community fee income and expense. noi and adjusted noi are calculated as noi and adjusted noi from consolidated properties, plus our share of noi and adjusted noi from unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period), less noncontrolling interests' share of noi and adjusted noi from consolidated joint ventures (calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period). management utilizes its share of noi and adjusted noi in assessing its performance as we have various joint ventures that contribute to its performance. we do not control our unconsolidated joint ventures, and our share of amounts from unconsolidated joint ventures do not represent our legal claim to such items. our share of noi and adjusted noi should not be considered a substitute for, and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to, our financial information presented in accordance with gaap.
adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as "cash noi." management believes noi and adjusted noi are important supplemental measures because they provide relevant and useful information by reflecting only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and present them on an unlevered basis. we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and to evaluate our same-store ("ss") performance, as described below. we believe that net income (loss) is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi and adjusted noi. noi and adjusted noi should not be viewed as alternative measures of operating performance to net income (loss) as defined by gaap since they do not reflect various excluded items. further, our definitions of noi and adjusted noi may not be comparable to the definitions used by other reits or real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi and adjusted noi. for a reconciliation of noi and adjusted noi to net income (loss) by segment, refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties, as well as ccrc facilities. we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries. we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense.
table of contents same-store same-store noi and adjusted (cash) noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties, excluding properties within the other non-reportable segments. we include properties from our consolidated portfolio, as well as properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures in same-store noi and adjusted noi (see noi definition above for further discussion regarding our use of pro-rata share information and its limitations). same-store adjusted noi excludes amortization of deferred revenue from tenant-funded improvements and certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis.
properties are included in same-store once they are stabilized for the full period in both comparison periods. newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up (typically when the tenant(s) control(s) the physical use of at least 80% of the space and rental payments have commenced) or 12 months from the acquisition date. newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service. properties that experience a change in reporting structure are considered stabilized after 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure. a property is removed from same-store when it is classified as held for sale, sold, placed into redevelopment, experiences a casualty event that significantly impacts operations, a change in reporting structure or operator transition has been agreed to, or a significant tenant relocates from a same-store property to a non same-store property and that change results in a corresponding increase in revenue. we do not report same-store metrics for our other non-reportable segments. for a reconciliation of same-store to total portfolio adjusted noi and other relevant disclosures by segment, refer to our segment analysis below.
funds from operations ("ffo")
ffo encompasses nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted, each of which is described in detail below. we believe ffo applicable to common shares, diluted ffo applicable to common shares, and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental non-gaap measures of operating performance for a reit. because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue.
nareit ffo. ffo, as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit"), is net income (loss) applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property, including any current and deferred taxes directly associated with sales of depreciable property, impairments of, or related to, depreciable real estate, plus real estate and other real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and adjustments to compute our share of nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted (see below) from joint ventures. adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. we reflect our share of nareit ffo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100%, we reflect our share of the equity by adjusting our nareit ffo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods. our pro rata share information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts, is intended to reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio and is calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period. we do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures, and the pro rata presentations of reconciling items included in nareit ffo do not represent our legal claim to such items. the joint venture members or partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the joint venture agreements, which provide for such allocations generally according to their invested capital.
the presentation of pro rata information has limitations, which include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses and (ii) other companies in our industry may calculate their pro rata interest differently, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure. because of these limitations, the pro rata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap. we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements, using the pro rata financial information as a supplement.
nareit ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss). we compute nareit ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition; however, other reits may report nareit ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours.
table of contents ffo as adjusted. in addition, we present nareit ffo on an adjusted basis before the impact of non-comparable items including, but not limited to, transaction-related items, other impairments (recoveries) and other losses (gains), restructuring and severance-related charges, prepayment costs (benefits) associated with early retirement or payment of debt, litigation costs (recoveries), casualty-related charges (recoveries), foreign currency remeasurement losses (gains), deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and changes in tax legislation ("ffo as adjusted"). these adjustments are net of tax, when applicable. transaction-related items include transaction expenses and gains/charges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities. prepayment costs (benefits) associated with early retirement of debt include the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of debt. other impairments (recoveries) and other losses (gains) include interest income associated with early and partial repayments of loans receivable and other losses or gains associated with non-depreciable assets including goodwill, dfls, undeveloped land parcels, and loans receivable. management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo run-rate and is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit. at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry, it also recognized that "management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community." we believe stockholders, potential investors, and financial analysts who review our operating performance are best served by an ffo run-rate earnings measure that includes certain other adjustments to net income (loss), in addition to adjustments made to arrive at the nareit defined measure of ffo. ffo as adjusted is used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe it is important that stockholders, potential investors, and financial analysts understand this measure used by management. we use ffo as adjusted to: (i) evaluate our performance in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions, (ii) evaluate the performance of our management, (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources, (iv) assess our performance as compared with similar real estate companies and the industry in general, and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating an adjusted ffo measure, and accordingly, our ffo as adjusted may not be comparable to those reported by other reits. for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted and other relevant disclosure, refer to "non-gaap financial measures reconciliations" below.
table of contents adjusted ffo ("affo"). affo is defined as ffo as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) amortization of stock-based compensation, (ii) amortization of deferred financing costs, net, (iii) straight-line rents, (iv) deferred income taxes, and (v) other affo adjustments, which include: (a) amortization of acquired market lease intangibles, net, (b) non-cash interest related to dfls and lease incentive amortization (reduction of straight-line rents), (c) actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported, and (d) amortization of deferred revenues, excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements owned/recognized by us and up-front cash payments made by tenants to reduce their contractual rents. also, affo is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including second generation leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements, and includes adjustments to compute our share of affo from our unconsolidated joint ventures. more specifically, recurring capital expenditures, including second generation leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements ("affo capital expenditures") excludes our share from unconsolidated joint ventures (reported in "other affo adjustments"). adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. we reflect our share of affo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. we reflect our share for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our affo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods (reported in "other affo adjustments"). see ffo for further disclosure regarding our use of pro rata share information and its limitations. we believe affo is an alternative run-rate earnings measure that improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with: (i) expected results, (ii) results of previous periods, and (iii) results among reits more meaningful. affo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as it excludes the following items which generally flow through our cash flows from operating activities: (i) adjustments for changes in working capital or the actual timing of the payment of income or expense items that are accrued in the period, (ii) transaction-related costs, (iii) litigation settlement expenses, and (iv) restructuring and severance-related charges. furthermore, affo is adjusted for recurring capital expenditures, which are generally not considered when determining cash flows from operations or liquidity. other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating affo, and accordingly, our affo may not be comparable to those reported by other reits. management believes affo provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance and is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit, and by presenting affo, we are assisting these parties in their evaluation. affo is a non-gaap supplemental financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with gaap and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the company's financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to affo and other relevant disclosure, refer to "non-gaap financial measures reconciliations" below.

(1)for the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures, see "non-gaap financial measure reconciliations" below.
net income (loss) applicable to common shares decreased primarily as a result of the following:
•a decrease in income from discontinued operations, primarily as a result of a decrease in gain on sales of real estate from dispositions of our senior housing portfolios, partially offset by lower impairments of depreciable real estate and goodwill;
•a decrease in gains on sale of depreciable real estate, primarily related to the hoag hospital sale in may 2021;

•an increase in general and administrative expenses, primarily as a result of: (i) severance-related charges associated with the departures of our former chief executive officer and our former chief legal officer and general counsel in the fourth quarter of 2022 and (ii) charges incurred in connection with the downsizing of our corporate headquarters in denver, colorado;
•an increase in depreciation, primarily as a result of: (i) development and redevelopment projects placed in service during 2021 and 2022 and (ii) 2021 and 2022 acquisitions of real estate;
•an increase in interest expense, primarily as a result of: (i) higher interest rates under the commercial paper program and (ii) borrowings under the 2022 term loan facilities;
•a decrease in interest income primarily as a result of principal repayments on and sales of loans receivable in 2021 and 2022;
•expenses incurred in 2022 for tenant relocation and other costs associated with the demolition of an mob;
•an increase in loan loss reserves in 2022 primarily due to macroeconomic conditions and increased interest rates; and
•casualty-related charges during 2022.
the decrease in net income (loss) applicable to common shares was partially offset by:
•a gain upon change of control related to the sale of a 30% interest and deconsolidation of seven previously consolidated life science assets in south san francisco, california;
•a decrease in loss on debt extinguishments related to our repurchase and redemption of certain outstanding senior notes in the first and second quarters of 2021;
•an increase in noi generated from our life science and medical office segments related to: (i) 2021 and 2022 acquisitions of real estate, (ii) development and redevelopment projects placed in service during 2021 and 2022, and (iii) new leasing activity during 2021 and 2022 (including the impact to straight-line rents);
•a gain on sale of a hospital under a dfl that was sold in the first quarter of 2022; and
•fewer impairment charges on depreciable real estate.
nareit ffo increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting net income (loss) applicable to common shares, except for the following, which are excluded from nareit ffo:
•depreciation and amortization expense;
•gain on sales of depreciable real estate;
•gain upon change of control; and
•impairment charges related to depreciable real estate.

general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily as a result of: (i) severance-related charges associated with the departures of our former chief executive officer and our former chief legal officer and general counsel in the fourth quarter of 2022 and (ii) charges incurred in connection with the downsizing of our corporate headquarters in denver, colorado.

gain (loss) on debt extinguishments loss on debt extinguishments decreased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as a result of the repurchase and redemption of certain outstanding senior notes in the first and second quarters of 2021 with no repurchases or redemptions during 2022.

noncontrolling interests' share in discontinued operations noncontrolling interests' share in discontinued operations decreased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as a result of the completion of our dispositions of our senior housing portfolios.
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we anticipate that our cash flow from operations, available cash balances, and cash from our various financing activities will be adequate for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future for purposes of: (i) funding recurring operating expenses; (ii) meeting debt service requirements; and (iii) satisfying funding of distributions to our stockholders and non-controlling interest members. distributions are made using a combination of cash flows from operations, funds available under our bank line of credit (the "revolving facility") and commercial paper program, proceeds from the sale of properties, and other sources of cash available to us.
in addition to funding the activities above, our principal liquidity needs for the next 12 months are to:
•fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs; and
•fund future acquisition, transactional, and development and redevelopment activities.
our longer term liquidity needs include the items listed above as well as meeting debt service requirements.
we anticipate satisfying these future needs using one or more of the following:
•cash flow from operations;
•sale of, or exchange of ownership interests in, properties or other investments;
•borrowings under our revolving facility and commercial paper program;
•issuance of additional debt, including unsecured notes, term loans, and mortgage debt; and/or
•issuance of common or preferred stock or its equivalent under the atm program (as defined below).
our ability to access the capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well. our 2022 term loan facilities accrue interest at adjusted secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") administered by the federal reserve bank of new york plus a margin that depends on the credit ratings of our senior unsecured long-term debt. additionally, our revolving facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to the london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a margin that depends upon our credit ratings for our senior unsecured long-term debt. our revolving facility includes customary libor replacement language, including, but not limited to, the use of rates based on sofr. we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our credit ratings. as of february 6, 2023, we had long-term credit ratings of baa1 from moody's and bbb+ from s&p global and fitch, and short-term credit ratings of p-2, a-2, and f2 from moody's, s&p global, and fitch, respectively.
a downgrade in credit ratings by moody's, s&p global, and fitch may have a negative impact on the interest rates and facility fees for our revolving facility and 2022 term loan facilities and may negatively impact the pricing of notes issued under our commercial paper program and senior unsecured notes. while a downgrade in our credit ratings would adversely impact our cost of borrowing, we believe we would continue to have access to the unsecured debt markets, and we could also seek to enter into one or more secured debt financings, issue additional securities, including under our atm program, or dispose of certain assets to fund future operating costs, capital expenditures, or acquisitions, although no assurances can be made in this regard. refer to "market trends and uncertainties" above for a more comprehensive discussion of the potential impact of covid as well as economic and market conditions on our business.
material cash requirements our material cash requirements include the below contractual and other obligations.
debt. as of december 31, 2022, we had total debt of $6.5 billion, including borrowings under our bank line of credit and commercial paper program, senior unsecured notes, term loans, and mortgage debt. future interest payments associated with such debt total $1.2 billion, $188 million of which are payable within twelve months. of our total debt, the total amount payable within twelve months is comprised of $90 million of mortgage debt. commercial paper borrowings are backstopped by our bank line of credit. as such, we calculate the weighted average remaining term of our commercial paper borrowings using the maturity date of our bank line of credit. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
development and redevelopment commitments.  our development and redevelopment commitments represent construction and other commitments for developments and redevelopments in progress and includes certain allowances for tenant improvements that we have provided as a lessor. as of december 31, 2022, we had $219 million of development and redevelopment commitments, $197 million of which we expect to spend within the next twelve months.
table of contents lease and other contractual commitments.  our lease and other contractual commitments represent our commitments, as lessor, under signed leases and contracts for operating properties and include allowances for tenant improvements and leasing commissions. these commitments exclude allowances for tenant improvements related to developments and redevelopments in progress for which we have executed an agreement with a general contractor to complete the tenant improvements, which are recognized as development and redevelopment commitments and are discussed further above. as of december 31, 2022, we had total lease and other contractual commitments of $33 million, $30 million of which we expect to spend within the next twelve months.
construction loan commitments. due to the terms of our shop seller financing notes receivable, as of december 31, 2022, we are obligated to provide additional loans up to $40 million to fund senior housing redevelopment and capital expenditure projects, which extend through 2024. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
ground and other operating lease commitments.  our ground and other operating lease commitments represent our commitments as lessee under signed operating leases. as of december 31, 2022, we had total ground and other operating lease commitments of $551 million, $17 million of which are payable within twelve months. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
redeemable noncontrolling interests. certain of our noncontrolling interest holders have the ability to put their equity interests to us upon specified events or after the passage of a predetermined period of time. each put option is subject to changes in redemption value in the event that the underlying property generates specified returns for us and meets certain promote thresholds pursuant to the respective agreements. during the year ended december 31, 2022, one of the redeemable noncontrolling interests met the conditions for redemption, but was not yet exercised. as of december 31, 2022, the redemption value of our redeemable noncontrolling interests was $106 million. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
distribution and dividend requirements. our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we meet the dividend requirements of the code, relative to maintaining our reit status, while still allowing us to retain cash to fund capital improvements and other investment activities. under the code, reits may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income. we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.30 per common share in 2022. our future common dividends, if and as declared, may vary and will be determined by the board based upon the circumstances prevailing at the time, including our financial condition.
off-balance sheet arrangements we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. two of these joint ventures have mortgage debt of $87 million, of which our share is $40 million. except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture. we have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources.
inflation a significant portion of our revenues are derived from leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates, subject to annual escalations. a period of high inflation could result in increases in the consumer price index in excess of our fixed annual escalations. certain of our leases provide that annual rent is modified based on changes in the consumer price index or other thresholds.
most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes, insurance, and utilities. substantially all of our life science leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs.
labor costs, costs of construction materials, interest, utilities, and other operating costs may increase during periods of inflation. inflationary increases in expenses will generally be offset, in whole or in part, by the tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above.

the following table sets forth changes in cash flows (in thousands):

operating cash flows our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy levels of our buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants' performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses, and other factors. operating cash flows increased $105 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as the result of: (i) 2021 and 2022 acquisitions, (ii) annual rent increases, (iii) new leasing and renewal activity, and (iv) developments and redevelopments placed in service during 2021 and 2022. the increase in operating cash flow is partially offset by: (i) a decrease in income related to assets sold during 2021 and 2022 and (ii) an increase in operating expenses.
investing cash flows our cash flows from investing activities are generally used to fund acquisitions, developments, and redevelopments of real estate assets, net of proceeds received from sales of real estate assets, sales of dfls, and repayments on loans receivable. our net cash used in investing activities increased $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of the following: (i) fewer sales of real estate assets, (ii) increased development and redevelopment of real estate assets, and (iii) fewer repayments on loans receivable. the increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by: (i) a reduction in investments related to the acquisitions of real estate assets, (ii) proceeds received from the sale of a 30% interest in seven previously consolidated life science assets in south san francisco, california, and (iii) proceeds received from the sale of a hospital under a dfl.
financing cash flows our cash flows from financing activities are generally impacted by issuances of equity, borrowings and repayments under our bank line of credit and commercial paper program, senior unsecured notes, term loans, and mortgage debt, net of dividends paid to common shareholders. our net cash used in financing activities decreased $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of the following: (i) no repayments of senior unsecured notes (including debt extinguishment costs) in 2022, (ii) issuance of the 2022 term loan facilities, (iii) proceeds received from the settlement of forward contracts under our atm program, and (iv) fewer purchases of and distributions to noncontrolling interests. the decrease in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by: (i) lower borrowings and higher repayments under the bank line of credit and commercial paper program, (ii) no senior unsecured notes issuances in 2022, and (iii) an increase in common stock repurchases.
discontinued operations operating, investing, and financing cash flows in our consolidated statements of cash flows are reported inclusive of both cash flows from continuing operations and cash flows from discontinued operations. certain significant cash flows from discontinued operations are disclosed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. the absence of future cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to significantly impact our liquidity, as the proceeds from senior housing triple-net and shop dispositions were used to pay down debt and invest in additional real estate in our other business lines. additionally, we have multiple other sources of liquidity that can be utilized in the future, as needed. refer to the beginning of the liquidity and capital resources section above for additional information regarding our liquidity.
debt in july 2022, we increased the maximum aggregate face or principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the commercial paper program from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion.
in august 2022, we executed the 2022 term loan agreement that provided for two senior unsecured delayed draw term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million. in october 2022, the entirety of the $500 million under the 2022 term loan facilities was drawn.
table of contents in january 2023, we completed a public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due in 2032.
see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our outstanding debt.
approximately 85% and 79% of our consolidated debt was fixed rate debt as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. at december 31, 2022, our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt had weighted average interest rates of 3.46% and 4.91%, respectively. at december 31, 2021, our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt had weighted average interest rates of 3.40% and 0.59%, respectively. as of december 31, 2022, we had $142 million of variable rate mortgage debt swapped to fixed through interest rate swap instruments and the $500 million 2022 term loan facilities swapped to fixed through forward starting interest rate swap instruments. these interest rate swap instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. for purposes of classification of the amounts above, variable rate debt with a derivative financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is reported as fixed rate debt due to us having effectively established a fixed interest rate for the underlying debt instrument. as of december 31, 2021, we had $142 million of variable rate mortgage debt subject to interest rate cap instruments. for a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" below.
equity at december 31, 2022, we had 547 million shares of common stock outstanding, equity totaled $7.2 billion, and our equity securities had a market value of $13.9 billion.
at december 31, 2022, non-managing members held an aggregate of five million units in seven limited liability companies ("downreits") for which we are the managing member. the downreit units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications). at december 31, 2022, the outstanding downreit units were convertible into approximately seven million shares of our common stock.
at-the-market program our at-the-market equity offering program (as amended from time to time, the "atm program") has a capacity of $1.5 billion. in addition to the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, we may also enter into one or more forward sales agreements (each, an "atm forward contract") with sales agents for the sale of our shares of common stock under our atm program.
during the year ended december 31, 2021, we utilized the forward provisions under the atm program to allow for the sale of an aggregate of 9.1 million shares of our common stock at an initial weighted average net price of $35.25 per share, after commissions. we did not utilize the forward provisions under the atm program during the year ended december 31, 2022. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we settled all 9.1 million shares previously outstanding under atm forward contracts at a weighted average net price of $34.01 per share, after commissions, resulting in net proceeds of $308 million. therefore, at december 31, 2022, no shares remained outstanding under atm forward contracts.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, there were no direct issuances of shares of common stock under the atm program.
at december 31, 2022, $1.18 billion of our common stock remained available for sale under the atm program. actual future sales of our common stock will depend upon a variety of factors, including but not limited to market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, and our capital needs. we have no obligation to sell any of the remaining shares under our atm program.
see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our atm program.
share repurchase program on august 1, 2022, our board of directors approved the share repurchase program under which we may acquire shares of our common stock in the open market up to an aggregate purchase price of $500 million. purchases of common stock under the share repurchase program may be exercised at our discretion with the timing and number of shares repurchased depending on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. the share repurchase program expires in august 2024 and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $27.16 per share for a total of $56 million. therefore, at december 31, 2022, $444 million of our common stock remained available for repurchase under the share repurchase program.
table of contents shelf registration in may 2021, we filed a prospectus with the sec as part of a registration statement on form s-3, using an automatic shelf registration process. this shelf registration statement expires on may 13, 2024 and at or prior to such time, we expect to file a new shelf registration statement. under the "shelf" process, we may sell any combination of the securities described in the prospectus through one or more offerings. the securities described in the prospectus include common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities and warrants.

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions. we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. from time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. below is a discussion of accounting estimates that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, including those related to critical accounting estimates further discussed below, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
real estate we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset or liability. the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings as-if-vacant, land, and lease intangibles. in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles, our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired. in the case of allocating fair value to in-place leases, we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue and/or depreciation and amortization expense that we will recognize over the remaining useful life for the acquired in-place leases.
impairment of long-lived assets we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets") when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows. the expected future undiscounted cash flows reflect external market factors and are probability-weighted to reflect multiple possible cash-flow scenarios, including selling the assets at various points in the future. additionally, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we make assumptions regarding external market conditions (including capitalization rates and growth rates), forecasted cash flows and sales prices, and our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset.
determining the fair value of real estate assets, including assets classified as held for sale, involves significant judgment and generally utilizes market capitalization rates, comparable market transactions, estimated per unit or per square foot prices, negotiations with prospective buyers, and forecasted cash flows (primarily lease revenue rates, expense rates, and growth rates). our ability to accurately predict future operating results and resulting cash flows, and estimate fair values, impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

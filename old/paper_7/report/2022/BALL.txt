item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k (annual report), which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. we apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as "ball corporation," "ball," "the company," "we" or "our" in the following discussion and analysis.
overview business overview and industry trends ball corporation is one of the world's leading aluminum packaging suppliers. our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses, are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates, such as plastics and glass. in the aluminum packaging industry, sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products, expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions. we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers, including national defense hardware, antenna and video tactical solutions, civil and operational space hardware and system engineering services.
we sell our aluminum packaging products mainly to large, multinational beverage, personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long-term relationships. this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts. while we have a diversified customer base, we sell a significant portion of our packaging products to major companies and brands, as well as to numerous regional customers. the overall global aluminum beverage and aerosol container industries are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term. the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace segment are u.s. government agencies or their prime contractors.
we purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers. we also have exposure to inflation, in particular the rising costs of raw materials, as well as other direct cost inputs. we mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of aluminum through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through aluminum price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments. the pass-through provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact, if any, on net earnings; however, there may be timing differences of when the costs are passed through. because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss, insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss, and our long-term relationships represent a known, stable customer base.
the majority of our aerospace business involves work under contracts, generally from one to five years in duration, as a prime contractor or subcontractor for various u.s. government agencies. intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of the company's aerospace and defense industry where it is common for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. a company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to a competitor, become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company.

corporate strategy our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving long-term success. since launching drive for 10 in 2011, we have made progress on each of the levers as follows:
●   maximizing value in our existing businesses by leveraging our aluminum container production capabilities across our global plant network to meet global demand, improving efficiencies and amplifying our sustainability credentials through aluminum stewardship initiative certification across our global aluminum container and end facilities in north america, south america and europe; leveraging plant floor and integrated planning systems to reduce costs and manage contractual provisions across our diverse customer base; successfully acquiring and integrating a large global aluminum beverage business and regional aluminum aerosol facility while also divesting underperforming assets; and in the aluminum aerosol business, installing new extruded aluminum aerosol lines in our european, mexican and indian facilities while also implementing cost-out and value-in initiatives across all of our businesses;

●   expanding further into new products and capabilities through delivering the broadest aluminum beverage and bottle portfolio, commercializing our lightweight, infinitely recyclable aluminum cup and providing next-generation extruded aluminum aerosol packaging that utilizes proprietary technology to significantly lightweight our products; and successfully introducing new specialty beverage cans and aluminum bottle-shaping technology;

●   aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets by prudently investing capital to meet continued growth for specialty beverage containers throughout our global network, which represent approximately 50 percent of our global beverage packaging mix; aligning with growing beverage customers and brand categories and other new beverage producers who continue to use aluminum beverage containers to grow their business; and in our aluminum cup business, establishing partnerships with food service providers, fast casual restaurants and event venues and utilizing online platforms and north american retailers to provide infinitely recyclable aluminum cups directly to consumers.

●   broadening our geographic reach with our acquisition of rexam in june 2016 and our new investments in beverage manufacturing facilities in the united states, brazil, paraguay, spain, czech republic, united kingdom, mexico, myanmar and panama, as well as extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing facilities in north america, europe, india and brazil, and the start-up of our aluminum cups business in the u.s.; and

●   leveraging our technological expertise in packaging innovation, including the introduction of our new proprietary, brandable lightweight aluminum cup and providing next-generation aluminum bottle-shaping technologies for new categories, occasions and refillable offerings through the increased production of lightweight real® containers and which utilize technology that increases the strength of aluminum used in the manufacturing process while lightweighting the can by up to 30 percent over a standard aluminum aerosol can, as well as leveraging our aerospace technologies and competencies to deliver exquisite space-based environmental, weather and defense monitoring solutions such as methane monitoring, weather prediction, lidar capabilities and hypersonics to preserve and protect our planet through enabling our aerospace customers with actionable ecosystem-related and intelligence data and resilient national security architectures.

these ongoing business developments help us stay close to our customers while expanding and/or sustaining our industry positions and global reach with major beverage, personal care, household products and aerospace customers. in order to successfully execute our strategy and reach our goals, we realize the importance of excelling in the following areas: customer focus, operational excellence, innovation and business development, people and culture focus and sustainability.

results of operations management's discussion and analysis for our results of operations on a consolidated and segment basis include a quantification of factors that had a material impact. other factors that did not have a material impact, but that are significant to understand the results, are qualitatively described.
refer to item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021, as filed on february 16, 2021, for a comparison of our 2021 results of operations to the 2020 results.
global economic environment in 2022 data indicated a sharp rise in inflation in the regions where we operate. current and future inflationary effects may continue to be impacted by, among other things, supply chain disruptions, governmental stimulus or fiscal policies, changes in interest rates, and changing demand for certain goods and services as recovery from the covid-19 pandemic continues. we cannot predict with any certainty the impact that rising interest rates, a global or any regional recession, or higher inflation may have on our customers or suppliers. additionally, we are unable to predict the potential effects that any resurgence of covid-19, its variants or any future pandemic, or the continuation or escalation of the military conflict between russia and ukraine, and related sanctions or market disruptions, may have on our business. it remains uncertain how long any of these conditions may last or how severe any of them may become.

sales in 2022 were $1,538 million higher compared to 2021 primarily due to the pass through of higher aluminum prices and the delayed recoverability of inflationary costs, partially offset by currency translation.
net earnings attributable to ball corporation in 2022 were $159 million lower than 2021 primarily due to increased manufacturing and inflationary costs and net charges from the impairment of russian long-lived assets and the gain from the sale of ball's russian aluminum beverage packaging business, partially offset by the gain on sale of our remaining equity investment in ball metalpack, lower pension settlement charges in 2022 than in 2021 and lower depreciation expense. in 2023 we expect to improve year-over-year results through fixed cost savings from rightsizing production and the contractual recovery of 2022 inflationary costs.
cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)
cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, was $12,766 million in 2022 compared to $11,085 million in 2021. these amounts represented 83 percent and 80 percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase year-over-year is primarily due to higher manufacturing costs, general inflationary cost pressures and global supply chain transportation disruptions. to mitigate these recent cost trends, we have established a commercial cost recovery program that is designed to help us recover a significant portion of those cost increases that fall outside our normal customer contracts. additionally, we took actions to normalize inventory levels and reduce fixed and variable costs heading into 2023 that we expect will improve financial results.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was $672 million in 2022 compared to $700 million in 2021. these amounts represented 4 percent and 5 percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended 2022 and 2021, respectively. amortization expense in 2022 and 2021 included $135 million and $152 million, respectively, for the amortization of acquired rexam intangibles.the decrease compared to the same period in 2021 is primarily due to revised estimated useful lives of the company's manufacturing equipment, buildings and certain assembly and test equipment, as well as
28
the impairment and ultimate sale of the russia aluminum beverage packaging business. see note 4 for details regarding the sale of the russian operations.
effective july 1, 2022, ball revised the estimated useful lives of all of its equipment and buildings included in the analysis, which resulted in a net reduction in depreciation expense of approximately $49 million ($37 million after tax, or $0.12 per diluted share) for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the amount of depreciation expense that would have been recognized by utilizing the prior depreciable lives. this change in useful lives is expected to reduce depreciation expense by approximately $49 million for the six months ended june 30, 2023, for those assets included in the revision analysis.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses were $626 million in 2022 compared to $593 million in 2021. these amounts represented 4 percent of consolidated net sales for 2022 and 2021. the increase in sg&a expenses was primarily due to higher accounts receivable factoring costs, partially offset by lower personnel costs during the fourth quarter.
business consolidation costs and other activities business consolidation costs and other activities were $71 million in 2022 compared to $142 million in 2021. these amounts represented less than 1 percent and 1 percent of consolidated net sales for 2022 and 2021, respectively. the amounts in 2022 included impairment losses on russia's long-lived asset group, the gain on sale of ball's russian aluminum beverage packaging business, the gain on sale of ball's remaining equity method investment in ball metalpack, charges related to a brazilian customer's contract breach, facility shutdown costs, charges for employee severance and benefits related to cost-out activities and a charge related to a donation to the ball foundation. the amounts in 2021 included a non-cash pension settlement charge of $135 million and gains resulting from brazilian indirect tax rulings of $22 million. further details regarding business consolidation costs and other activities, including the russian impairment and gain on sale, are provided in note 10 and note 4, respectively.
interest expense total interest expense was $330 million in 2022 compared to $283 million in 2021. interest expense, excluding the effect of debt refinancing and other costs, as a percentage of average borrowings increased by approximately 10 basis points from 3.4 percent in 2021 to 3.5 percent in 2022 due to an increase in global interest rates. increased debt levels in 2022 compared to 2021 further contributed to higher interest expense for the year.
tax provision the company's effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as income earned in non-u.s. jurisdictions with tax rates that differ from the u.s. tax rate and by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year.
the 2022 effective income tax rate was 18.0 percent compared to 15.5 percent for 2021. as compared with the statutory u.s. federal income tax rate of 21 percent, the 2022 effective income tax rate was reduced by 3.2 percent for the impact of the u.s. research and development credit and by 2.8 percent for the impact of non-u.s. rate differences including tax holidays. these reductions were partially offset by an increase of 2.3 percent for u.s. state and local taxes and by 1.6 percent for equity compensation related impacts. while these items are expected to recur, the potential magnitude of each item is uncertain.
further details of taxes on income, including impacts of the u.s. tax reform, are provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.

in the third quarter of 2022, ball announced the permanent closure of its aluminum beverage can manufacturing facilities in phoenix, arizona, and st. paul, minnesota. the phoenix facility ceased production in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the st. paul facility ceased production in the first quarter of 2023.
segment sales in 2022 were $840 million higher compared to 2021 primarily due to the pass through of higher aluminum prices, partially offset by unfavorable price/mix.
comparable operating earnings in 2022 were $39 million lower compared to 2021 primarily due to unfavorable fixed cost absorption, higher inflationary costs and unfavorable customer mix, partially offset by favorable contractual terms, cost pass throughs and lower depreciation expense associated with the third quarter 2022 revision of estimated useful lives. in 2023 we expect to improve year-over-year results through fixed cost savings from rightsizing production and the contractual recovery of 2022 inflationary costs.

segment sales in 2022 were $345 million higher compared to 2021 primarily due to the pass through of higher aluminum prices, favorable price/mix and 4 percent volume growth, partially offset by approximately $400 million from unfavorable currency translation and the sale of the russian aluminum beverage packaging business.
comparable operating earnings in 2022 were $94 million lower compared to 2021 primarily due to approximately $40 million from unfavorable currency translation, the impact of higher inflation, energy costs, supply disruptions across the region and the sale of the russian aluminum beverage packaging business, partially offset by the pass through of higher aluminum prices, volume growth and lower depreciation expense associated with the third quarter 2022 revision of estimated useful lives.
during the third quarter of 2022, and further to the russian invasion of ukraine, the company sold its russian business, composed of three manufacturing facilities, for total cash consideration of $530 million. the historical operations and results of the russian aluminum packaging business, including the gain on sale, are included in the beverage packaging, emea segment. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report for additional discussion regarding the sale and its impact to ball's financial results.

segment sales in 2022 were $66 million higher compared to 2021, and comparable operating earnings were $1 million higher, primarily due to the company's new program wins, backlog growth and related backlog liquidation through contract performance, offset by supply chain inefficiencies and cost increases/inflationary pressures during 2022.
sales to the u.s. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented 98 percent of segment sales in 2022 and 97 percent in 2021. the aerospace contract mix in 2022 consisted of 40 percent cost-type contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed-upon and/or earned profit component, and 57 percent fixed-price contracts. the remaining sales were for time and materials contracts.
31
backlog for the aerospace segment at december 31, 2022 and 2021, was $2.97 billion and $2.47 billion, respectively. the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value. the segment has numerous outstanding bids for future contract awards. the backlog at december 31, 2022, consisted of 35 percent cost-type contracts. comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts, funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards.
management performance measures management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as comparable operating earnings (earnings before interest, taxes and business consolidation and other non-comparable costs); comparable net earnings (earnings before business consolidation costs and other non-comparable costs after tax); comparable diluted earnings per share (comparable net earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding); return on average invested capital (net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period); economic value added (eva®) dollars (net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed); earnings before interest and taxes (ebit); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda); and diluted earnings per share. in addition, management uses operating cash flows as a measure to evaluate the company's liquidity. we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria that management uses to make strategic decisions. these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods, including business consolidation costs and other non-comparable items.
nonfinancial measures used in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figures; environmental, health and safety statistics; production and sales volume data; asset utilization rates and measures of sustainability. additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog. references to sales volume data represent units shipped.
many of the above noted financial measurements are presented on a non-u.s. gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report. non-u.s. gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. a presentation of earnings in accordance with u.s. gaap is available in item 8 of this annual report.
critical accounting policies and estimates for information regarding the company's critical and significant accounting policies, as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see note 1 and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.
the company considers certain accounting estimates to be critical, as their application is made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations. detailed below is a discussion of why, to the extent the estimate is material, these estimates are subject to uncertainty and the sensitivity of the reported amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying the estimate's calculation.
32
revenue recognition in the aerospace segment sales under fixed-price long-term contracts in the aerospace segment are primarily recognized using percentage-of-completion accounting under the cost-to-cost method. the company believes the accounting estimates related to revenue recognition in its aerospace segment are critical accounting estimates because they are highly reliant upon estimation throughout the segment's contracts with its customers. the recognition of revenue requires significant estimation on the part of management, including estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections related to the outcome of future events, and evaluation of estimates of total contract revenue, total contract cost, and extent of progress toward completion. aside from estimation of total contract cost and progress towards completion, total revenues in our aerospace segment are subject to uncertainty due to the total amount that will be paid by the customer giving rise to variable consideration. the primary types of variable consideration present in the company's contracts are cost reimbursements, performance award fees, incremental funding and finalization of government rates. the company's accounting policy around revenue recognition in its aerospace segment and further details of estimates used in revenue recognition in its aerospace segment can be found in note 1 and note 5, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.
defined benefit pension plans the company has defined benefit plans which require management to make assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to determine the present value of future obligations and expenses, salary inflation rates, mortality rates and other assumptions. the company believes the accounting estimates related to its pension plans are critical accounting estimates because several of the company's defined benefit plans have significant asset and liability balances, and because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions and contracted benefit changes. these assumptions do not change during the company's fiscal year unless a remeasurement event occurs in one of the plans, such as a significant settlement. the assumptions used in accounting for the company's defined benefit plans and how they have changed over time, as well as the sensitivity of the plans to changes in their related assumptions, can be found in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external borrowings. we believe that cash flows from operating activities and cash provided by short-term, long-term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments, anticipated share repurchases and anticipated capital expenditures. the following table summarizes our cash flows:

cash flows provided by operating activities were $301 million in 2022, primarily driven by net earnings of $732 million, depreciation and amortization of $672 million and business consolidation and other costs of $71 million, partially offset by working capital outflows of $924 million and pension contributions of $124 million. in comparison to the same period in 2021, and after adjusting for the impact of capital expenditures, our working capital movements reflect an increase in days sales outstanding of 7 days in 2022, an increase in inventory days on hand of 14 days in 2022 and a decrease in days payable outstanding of 6 days in 2022.
cash outflows from investing activities were $786 million in 2022 predominantly driven by $1.65 billion in capital expenditures, partially offset by $455 million net cash received for the sale of our russian aluminum beverage packaging business, net of the cash on the disposed business, and $298 million received for the for the sale of our remaining 49 percent owned equity investment in ball metalpack.

cash inflows from financing activities were $485 million in 2022, primarily driven by the issuance of $750 million of 6.875% senior notes due 2028, $394 million of borrowings under short-term uncommitted credit facilities and $200 million of borrowings under the company's long-term revolving facility, partially offset by the repayment of $738 million of 4.375% senior notes, net share repurchases of $582 million and common stock dividends of $254 million.
we have entered into several regional committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with various financial institutions for certain of our accounts receivable. programs accounted for as true sales of the receivables, without recourse to ball, had combined limits of approximately $2.04 billion and $1.74 billion at december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021, respectively. a total of $488 million and $308 million were available for sale under these programs at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
as of december 31, 2022, approximately $546 million of our cash was held outside of the u.s. in the event we need to utilize any of the cash held outside of the u.s. for purposes within the u.s., there are no material legal or other economic restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash from any of the countries outside the u.s. where we have cash. the company believes its u.s. operating cash flows and cash on hand, as well as availability under its long-term, revolving credit facilities, uncommitted short-term credit facilities and committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs, will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the u.s. portion of our ongoing operations, scheduled principal and interest payments on u.s. debt, dividend payments, capital expenditures and other u.s. cash requirements. if non-u.s. funds are needed for our u.s. cash requirements and we are unable to provide the funds through intercompany financing arrangements, we may be required to repatriate funds from non-u.s. locations where the company has previously asserted indefinite reinvestment of funds outside the u.s.
based on its indefinite reinvestment assertion, the company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain non-u.s. subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations. it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that might become payable if these earnings were remitted to the u.s.
share repurchases the company's share repurchases totaled $618 million in 2022 and $766 million in 2021. the repurchases were completed using cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the sale of businesses and available borrowings.
in the second quarter of 2022, in a privately negotiated transaction, ball entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy $300 million of its common shares using cash on hand and available borrowings. in the third quarter of 2022, ball settled the agreement and received a total of 4.34 million shares with the average price paid per share of $69.06.
debt facilities and refinancing given our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until june 2027, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements. total interest-bearing debt of $9.00 billion and $7.78 billion was outstanding at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
during 2022, ball issued $750 million of 6.875% senior notes due in 2028, redeemed $738 million of outstanding euro denominated 4.375% debt and completed the closing of its new revolving and term loan senior secured credit facilities that refinanced its existing senior secured credit facilities entered into in 2019. the company's senior credit facilities include a $1.35 billion term loan and long-term, multi-currency revolving facilities that mature in june 2027, which provide the company with up to the u.s. dollar equivalent of $1.75 billion. during 2021, ball issued $850 million of 3.125% senior notes due in 2031 and redeemed the outstanding 5% senior notes due in march 2022 in the amount of $748 million.
at december 31, 2022, approximately $1.49 billion was available under the company's long-term, multi-currency committed revolving credit facilities, which are available until june 2027. in addition to these facilities, the company had approximately $990 million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at december 31, 2022, of which $112 million was outstanding and due on demand.

while ongoing financial and economic conditions in certain areas may raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by allocating the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party. we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis.
some of ball's loan agreements use the london inter-bank offered rate (libor) in determining interest rates. the company is continually evaluating the impact that the transition from its libor-based interest rate loan agreements to secured overnight financing rate (sofr) based interest rate agreements will have on its consolidated financial statements. based on our most current understanding, the libor to sofr transition is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31, 2022, and for all prior years presented, and we have met all debt payment obligations. the u.s. note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. the most restrictive of our debt covenants requires us to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined) of no greater than 5.0 times, which will change to 4.5 times as of september 30, 2025. as of december 31, 2022, the company could borrow an additional $2.32 billion under its long-term multi-currency committed revolving facilities and short-term uncommitted credit facilities without violating our existing debt covenants. additional details about our debt are available in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.
defined benefit pension plans the company closed its pension plans to all non-unionized new entrants in the united states effective for anyone hired after december 31, 2021. new employees instead receive a non-elective 401(k) company contribution that is expected to approximate the legacy pension benefit. anyone employed by ball prior to that date is unaffected by this change.
other liquidity measures given the on-going growth projects in our businesses being undertaken to support eva-enchancing contacted volumes, in 2023, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.2 billion and we intend to return approximately $250 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. we further intend to utilize our operating cash flows to pay down debt and, to the extent available, repurchase ball common stock or fund acquisitions that meet our rate of return criteria.
we have committed contracts to purchase raw materials and we align these purchase commitments with long-term sales contracts with our customers such that any commitment to purchase aluminum and other direct materials corresponds to a contractual sale. these aluminum purchase commitments include pass-through provisions which generally result in proportional changes in both sales and costs of sales; however, there may be timing differences of when the costs are passed through.
the company's growth and asset maintenance plans require capital expenditures over the next years, which will be funded by operating cash flows and external borrowings. approximately $810 million of capital expenditures were contractually committed as of december 31, 2022. maturities for ball's long-term debt are disclosed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report. repayments of debt and other operational cash requirements will also be funded by operating cash flows and external borrowings. the company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements.
contingencies, indemnifications and guarantees details of the company's contingencies, legal proceedings, indemnifications and guarantees are available in note 22 and note 23 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report. the company is routinely subject to litigation incidental to operating its businesses and has been designated by various federal and state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the clean-up of several hazardous waste sites, including in respect of sites related to alleged activities of certain former rexam subsidiaries. the company believes the matters identified will not have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity, results of operations or financial condition.

executive summary we are primarily engaged in the ownership, management, development, reposition, redevelopment, acquisition, and construction of multifamily apartment communities. overall, we focus on investing in markets characterized by high-growth economic conditions, strong employment, and attractive quality of life which we believe leads to higher demand and retention of our apartments. as of december 31, 2022, we owned interests in, operated, or were developing 178 multifamily properties comprised of 60,652 apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the property portfolio table below. in addition, we own other land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future.
business environment and current outlook our results for the year ended december 31, 2022, reflect an increase in same store revenues of approximately 11.2% as compared to the same period in 2021. the increase was primarily due to higher average rental rates which we believe was primarily attributable to improving job growth, favorable demographics with a higher propensity to rent versus buy, higher demand for multifamily housing in our markets, and a manageable supply of new multifamily housing.
we currently believe the supply of multifamily homes will remain at manageable levels during 2023. however, if economic conditions were to worsen, our operating results could be adversely affected.
consolidated results net income attributable to common shareholders was $653.6 million and $303.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, respectively. the increase during the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to a $474.1 million gain recognized as a result of the remeasurement of our previously held 31.3% ownership interest in two unconsolidated investment funds (collectively, the "funds") upon our acquiring the remaining ownership interests in these funds on april 1, 2022, and an increase in property operations. see further discussion of our 2022 operations as compared to 2021 in "results of operations," below. the increase was partially offset by recognizing a higher gain on sale of two operating properties in 2021 of $174.4 million as compared to a $36.4 million gain on sale of one operating property in 2022. the increase was also partially offset by higher depreciation expense and amortization of in-place leases in 2022 related to the consolidation of 22 properties upon acquiring the remaining ownership interests in the funds in 2022, and the acquisition of four operating properties in 2021.
construction activity at december 31, 2022, we had a total of six projects under construction to be comprised of 1,950 apartment homes. initial occupancies of these six projects are currently scheduled to occur within the next 18 months. we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the six projects to be approximately $306.7 million.
acquisitions operating properties: on april 1, 2022, we purchased the remaining 68.7% ownership interests in the funds for cash consideration of approximately $1.1 billion, after adjusting for our assumption of approximately $515 million of existing secured mortgage debt of the funds which remained outstanding. these funds own 22 multifamily communities comprised of 7,247 units located in houston, austin, dallas, tampa, raleigh, orlando, washington d.c., charlotte, and atlanta. after obtaining 100% of the ownership interests, we consolidated the funds as of april 1, 2022, and no longer recognize fee and asset management income from property management, construction, and development activities, related expenses or equity in income for these funds.
land: during the year ended december 31, 2022, we acquired for future development purposes two parcels of land totaling approximately 42.6 acres in charlotte, north carolina for an aggregate cost of approximately $32.7 million;
approximately 3.8 acres of land in nashville, tennessee for approximately $30.5 million; and approximately 15.9 acres of land in richmond, texas for approximately $7.8 million.
dispositions operating properties: during the year ended december 31, 2022, we sold one operating property comprised of 245 apartment homes located in largo, maryland for approximately $71.9 million and recognized a gain of approximately $36.4 million.
other in april 2022, we issued 2.9 million common shares in a public equity offering and received approximately $490.3 million in net proceeds, which we used to reduce borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
in 2022, we issued approximately 0.2 million common shares under our then current at-the-market ("atm") programs and received approximately $26.2 million in net proceeds. as of the date of this filing, we had common shares having an aggregate offering amount of up to $500.0 million remaining available for sale under our current 2022 atm program.
in august 2022, we amended and restated our existing credit facility to (i) add a $300 million unsecured term loan with a delayed draw feature with a maturity date of august 2024 (which may be extended at our option to august 2025), (ii) increase our existing unsecured revolving credit facility from $900 million to $1.2 billion, which may be expanded at our option up to three times and up to an additional $500 million upon satisfaction of certain conditions, (iii) amend the maturity date from march 2023 to august 2026, which may be extended at our option for two additional consecutive six-month periods, and (iv) change the interest rate from london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a margin to secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") plus a margin, subject to customary benchmark replacement provisions.
in september 2022, we extended the maturity date of our $40 million unsecured floating rate term loan with an unrelated third party from september 2022 to september 2024. additionally, the interest rate on the term loan was changed from libor plus a margin to sofr plus a margin.
in october 2022, our board of trust managers approved to increase the authorization for our share repurchase plan by approximately $230.5 million to a total of $500.0 million. there were no repurchases in 2022 or through the date of this filing, and the remaining dollar value of our common equity securities authorized to be repurchased under this program is $500.0 million.
in december 2022, we used the $300 million unsecured term loan and borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit facility to repay the principal amount of our 3.15% senior unsecured note payable, which matured on december 15, 2022, for a total of $350.0 million, plus accrued interest.
future outlook subject to market conditions, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop new communities, and to redevelop, reposition and acquire existing communities. we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise. we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations, maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios, and controlling overhead costs. we intend to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following: cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our atm programs, other unsecured borrowings, or secured mortgages.
as of december 31, 2022, we had approximately $1.1 billion available under our $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2022 and through the date of this filing, we also had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $500.0 million remaining available for sale under our 2022 atm program. we believe scheduled repayments of debt during the next 12 months are manageable at approximately $500.0 million which represents approximately 13.6% of our total outstanding debt, and excludes amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs. we believe we are well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to fund new development, redevelopment, and other capital funding requirements. we will, however, continue to assess and take further actions we believe are prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements.

results of operations changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period to period are due primarily to the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio, the lease-up of newly constructed properties, acquisitions, and dispositions.
management considers property net operating income ("noi") to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance to net income because it reflects the operating performance of our communities without an allocation of corporate level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. we define noi as total property income less property operating and maintenance expenses less real estate taxes. noi is further detailed in the property-level noi table as seen below. noi is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap") and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance, should not be considered an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, and should not be considered an indication of cash available to fund cash needs. additionally, noi as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation.

(1)    same store communities are communities we owned and were stabilized since january 1, 2021, excluding communities under redevelopment and properties held for sale. non-same store communities are stabilized communities not owned or stabilized since january 1, 2021, including communities under redevelopment and excluding properties held for sale. we define communities under redevelopment as communities with capital expenditures that improve a community's cash flow and competitive position through extensive unit, exterior building, common area, and amenity upgrades. management believes same store information is useful as it allows both management and investors to determine financial results over a particular period for the same set of communities. development and lease-up communities are non-stabilized communities we have developed since january 1, 2021, excluding properties held for sale. hurricane expenses include storm-related damages related to hurricane ian in september 2022. dispositions/other includes those communities disposed of or held for sale which are not classified as discontinued operations, non-multifamily rental properties, expenses related to land holdings not under active development, and other miscellaneous revenues and expenses.
same store analysis same store property noi increased approximately $96.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. the increase was due to an increase of approximately $115.1 million in same store property revenues, partially offset by an increase of approximately $18.9 million in same store property expenses, for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021.
the $115.1 million increase in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, was primarily due to an increase of approximately $108.2 million in rental revenues comprised of a 12.4% increase in average rental rates and higher other rental income, partially offset by a decrease in reletting income, net of uncollectible revenue. the increase was also due to higher income from our utility and other rebilling programs of $5.1 million and higher fees and other income of $1.8 million.
the $18.9 million increase in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, was primarily due to higher real estate taxes of $5.8 million as a result of increased property valuations, higher repairs and maintenance expenses of $5.0 million, higher property insurance of $4.4 million, and higher utilities and other property expenses of $3.0 million. the increase was also due to an increase of property general and administrative expense of $4.2 million, a portion of which was due to centralizing our workforce to manage certain responsibilities for all of our communities, partially offset by a decrease in salaries of $3.5 million.
non-same store and development and lease-up analysis property noi from non-same store and development and lease-up communities increased $114.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021. the increase was due to higher property noi from non-same store communities of approximately $113.6 million and higher property noi from development and lease-up communities of approximately $1.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021. the increase in property noi from our non-same store communities was primarily due to our acquiring the remaining ownership interests in the funds on april 1, 2022, and the acquisition of four operating properties during 2021. the increases were also due to three operating properties reaching stabilization during each of the years ended december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2022.

fee and asset management income from property management, asset management, construction, and development activities at our joint ventures and our third-party construction projects decreased approximately $5.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to 2021. the decrease was primarily due to the consolidation of the funds on april 1, 2022, and no longer earning the related fee and asset management income. the decrease was also due to lower fees earned related to a decrease in third-party construction activity during 2022 as compared to 2021.
interest and other income increased approximately $1.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to 2021. the increase was primarily due to an earn-out received in 2022 related to a technology joint venture sold in september 2020.
our deferred compensation plans incurred a loss of approximately $19.6 million in 2022 and recognized income of approximately $14.4 million in 2021. the changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the expense/(benefit) related to these plans, as discussed below.

property management expenses, which primarily represent regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations, increased approximately $2.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to 2021. the increase was primarily related to higher salary, benefits, and incentive compensation costs primarily due to higher regional salary related costs which were previously allocated to fee and asset management expense and now recognized in property management expense upon our consolidating the funds after our acquisition on april 1, 2022. the increase in 2022 was also due to higher travel related expenses as compared to 2021. property management expenses were 2.0% and 2.3% of total property revenues for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
fee and asset management expense from property management, asset management, construction, and development activities at our joint ventures and our third-party projects decreased approximately $2.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to 2021. the decrease was primarily due to our consolidating the funds on april 1, 2022, and no longer incurring any related fee and asset management expenses.
general and administrative expenses increased approximately $1.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to 2021. excluding deferred compensation plans, general and administrative expenses were 4.2% and 5.1% of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
interest expense increased approximately $16.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to 2021. the increase in interest expense was primarily related to our assuming approximately $515 million of secured mortgage debt upon completion of the acquisition of the remaining ownership interests in the funds on april 1, 2022 with average interest rates of approximately 4.7% as of december 31, 2022. the increase was also due to higher interest expense recognized on our unsecured revolving credit facility resulting from an increase in average balances outstanding. the increase was partially offset by higher capitalized interest during 2022 resulting from higher average balances in our development pipeline as compared to 2021.
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $156.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to 2021. the increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization related to our acquisition of the remaining ownership interests in the funds on april 1, 2022, and higher depreciation related to the acquisition of four operating properties during 2021. the increase was also due to the completion of units in our development pipeline and the completion of repositions during 2021 and 2022, and was partially offset by lower depreciation expense related to the disposition of three operating properties during the fourth quarter of 2021 and one operating property during the first quarter of 2022.
our deferred compensation plans recognized a benefit of approximately $19.6 million in 2022 and incurred an expense of approximately $14.4 million in 2021. the changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the income/(loss) related to these plans, as discussed in the non-property income section above.

the $36.4 million gain on sale for the year ended december 31, 2022 was due to the disposition of one operating property located in largo, maryland during the first quarter of 2022. the $174.4 million gain on sale for the year ended december 31, 2021 was due to the sale of two operating properties located in houston, texas and the sale of one operating property located in laurel, maryland during the fourth quarter of 2021.
on april 1, 2022, we acquired the remaining 68.7% ownership interest in the funds. we had previously owned a 31.3% interest in each of these funds and accounted for the joint ventures under the equity method. as a result of acquiring the remaining ownership interests, we consolidated the funds and recorded a gain of approximately $474.1 million which represented the difference between the fair market value and the cost basis of our previously owned equity interests.
equity in income of joint ventures decreased approximately $6.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to 2021. the decrease was primarily due to our consolidating the funds on april 1, 2022.
income tax expense increased approximately $1.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. the increase was primarily due to higher state income taxes due to our acquiring the remaining ownership interests in the funds on april 1, 2022, partially offset by a decrease in taxable income due to lower third-party construction activities in a taxable reit subsidiary.
funds from operations ("ffo") and adjusted ffo ("affo")
management considers ffo and affo to be appropriate supplementary measures of the financial performance of an equity reit. the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") currently defines ffo as net income (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains (or losses) associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties, real estate depreciation and amortization, impairments of depreciable assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis. our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, including certain non-controlling interests, which are convertible into common shares. we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation, ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company's real estate investments between periods or to different companies.
affo is calculated utilizing ffo less recurring capitalized expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities. we also consider affo to be a useful supplemental measure because it is frequently used by analysts and investors to evaluate a reit's operating performance between periods or different companies. our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other reits, and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other reits.
to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, we believe ffo and affo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report. ffo and affo are not defined by gaap and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance. additionally, ffo and affo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation.
reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to ffo and affo for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:

liquidity and capital resources financial condition and sources of liquidity we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility, which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available. we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by:
•extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable;
•managing interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt;
•maintaining what management believes to be conservative coverage ratios; and
•using what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and equity.
our interest expense coverage ratio, net of capitalized interest, was approximately 7.4 and 6.7 times for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses, non-property income, and other expenses after adding back depreciation, amortization, and interest expense. approximately 83.9% and 100% of our properties were unencumbered at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 6.4 years at december 31, 2022.
we also intend to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals, which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations, maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios, and controlling overhead costs.
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations. other sources may include one or more of the following: availability under our unsecured credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our atm programs, and other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages. we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs over the next 12 months including:
•normal recurring operating expenses;
•current debt service requirements, including debt maturities;
•recurring capital expenditures;
•reposition expenditures;
•funding of property developments, redevelopments, and acquisitions; and
•the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the code.
factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets, changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws, sources of financing, the minimum reit dividend requirements, our ability to complete asset purchases, sales, or developments, the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our cost of funds, and our ability to access capital markets.
cash flows the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021.
net cash from operating activities was approximately $744.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to approximately $577.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to the increase in cash from property operations due to our acquiring the remaining interests in the funds, and the growth attributable to our same store, non-same store and development and lease-up communities. see further discussions of our 2022 operations as compared to 2021 in "results of operations."
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2022 totaled approximately $1.5 billion as compared to $804.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2021. cash outflows during 2022 primarily related to the acquisition of the funds for cash consideration of approximately $1.1 billion, and amounts paid for property development and capital improvements of approximately $449.4 million. these outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of one operating property of approximately $70.5 million. cash outflows during 2021 primarily related to the acquisition of four operating properties for approximately $630.0 million, and amounts paid for property development and capital improvements of approximately $428.7 million. these outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of three operating properties of approximately $254.7 million. the increase in property development and capital improvements for 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, was primarily due to higher capital expenditures, capitalized interest, real estate taxes and other capitalized indirect costs, partially offset by the timing and completion of five consolidated operating properties in 2022 and 2021. the property development and capital improvements during 2022 and 2021, included the following:

net cash from financing activities totaled approximately $109.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to approximately $421.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2021. cash inflows during 2022 primarily related to net proceeds of $516.8 million from the issuance of approximately 2.9 million common shares from our equity offering and approximately 0.2 million common shares from our atm programs, as well as net proceeds of approximately $300.0 million of borrowings under our unsecured term loan, and net proceeds of $42.0 million of borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit facility. these cash inflows were partially offset by approximately $396.8 million to pay distributions to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders, and the repayment of $350.0 million senior unsecured notes in the fourth quarter of 2022. cash inflows during 2021 primarily related to net proceeds of approximately $759.2 million from the issuance of approximately 5.4 million common shares from our atm programs. these cash inflows were partially offset by approximately $343.0 million to pay distributions to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders.
financial flexibility in august 2022, we amended and restated our existing credit facility to among other things, add a $300 million unsecured term loan with a delayed draw feature that matures in august 2024 (which may be extended at the company's option to august 2025), and increase the capacity of our existing unsecured revolving credit facility from $900 million to $1.2 billion which may be expanded, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, by up to three times and $500 million in the aggregate by requesting increases to the revolving credit facility and term loan or requesting additional term loans. we also extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from march 2023 to august 2026, with two options to further extend the facility at our election for two additional consecutive six-month periods. the interest rates on our unsecured revolving credit facility and delayed term loan are based upon sofr plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change. advances under our revolving credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rates, or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates. these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of $600 million or the remaining amount available under our revolving credit facility. our revolving credit facility and delayed term loan are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations. we believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations as of december 31, 2022 and through the date of this filing.
our unsecured revolving credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to $50 million in letters of credit. while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, it does reduce the amount available. at december 31, 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $14.2 million, approximately $1.1 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility, and approximately $300 million outstanding on our term loan.
in may 2022, we created an atm share offering program through which we can, but have no obligation to, sell common shares for an aggregate offering amount of up to $500.0 million (the "2022 atm program"), in amounts and at times as we determine, into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common shares, and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us. the proceeds from any sale of our common shares under the 2022 atm program are intended to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include reducing future borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, the repayment of other indebtedness, the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities, funding for development activities, and financing for acquisitions. as of the date of this filing we have not entered into any forward sales agreements and have common shares having an aggregate offering amount of up to $500.0 million remaining available for sale under this atm program.
we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement which allows us to offer, from time to time, common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, or warrants. our amended and restated declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 185 million shares of beneficial interest, consisting of 175 million common shares and 10 million preferred shares. at december 31, 2022, we had approximately 106.5 million common shares outstanding, net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements, and no preferred shares outstanding.
we believe our ability to access the capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by fitch, moody's, and standard and poor's, which were a- with stable outlook, a3 with stable outlook, and a- with stable outlook, respectively, as of december 31, 2022. we believe our ability to access the capital markets is also enhanced by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks, fannie mae, freddie mac, or life insurance companies. however, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future.
future cash requirements and contractual obligations one of our principal long-term liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt, including any future borrowings under our unsecured credit facility. we believe scheduled repayments of debt during the next 12 months are manageable at approximately $500.0 million which represents approximately 13.6% of our total outstanding debt, and excludes amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs. see note 9, "notes payable," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities beyond 2023. interest payments related to the debt discussed above and as further discussed in note 9 will be approximately $111.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 and for the years ending 2024 through 2027 will be approximately $92.3 million, $80.3 million, $68.5 million and $67.8 million, respectively, and approximately $310.6 million in the aggregate thereafter.
we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the six consolidated projects to be approximately $306.7 million. of this amount, we expect to incur costs between approximately $190 million and $200 million during 2023 and to incur the remaining costs during 2024. additionally, we expect to incur costs between approximately $85 million and $105 million related to the start of new development activities, between approximately $93 million and $97 million of repositions, redevelopment, repurposes, and revenue enhancing expenditures and between approximately $96 million and $100 million of additional recurring capital expenditures during 2023.
we anticipate meeting our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following: cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our atm programs, other unsecured borrowings, or secured mortgages. we continue to evaluate our operating properties and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise.
as a reit, we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute current dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90% of our annual taxable income. in order to reduce the amount of income taxes, our general policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income. in december 2022, we announced our board of trust managers had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of december 16, 2022. this dividend was subsequently paid on january 17, 2023, and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units. when aggregated with previous 2022 dividends, this distribution to common shareholders and holders of the common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of $3.76 per share or unit for the year ended december 31, 2022.
in the first quarter of 2023, the company's board of trust managers declared a first quarter dividend of $1.00 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of march 31, 2023. future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the board of trust managers and depend on cash flows generated from operations, the company's financial condition and capital requirements, distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors, including the company's past performance and future prospects, which may be deemed relevant by our board of trust managers. assuming similar dividend distributions for the remainder of 2023, our annualized dividend rate for 2023 would be $4.00.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies. for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, see note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements," to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
valuation of assets. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. impairment may exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets. we consider projected future undiscounted cash flows, trends, strategic decisions regarding future development plans, and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment indicators exist. while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding a number of factors, including market rents, economic conditions, and occupancies, could significantly affect these estimates. when impairment exists, the long-lived asset is adjusted to its fair value. in estimating fair value, management uses appraisals, management estimates, and discounted cash flow calculations which utilize inputs from a marketplace participant's perspective. in addition, we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures, if any, and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment below our carrying value, we will record an impairment charge. we did not record any impairment charges for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020.
the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions, including estimates of the project start date, projected construction costs, as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities. we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses. due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses, it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated.
we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets, properties under development, and land is currently recoverable. however, if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates, we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets. any such material non-cash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

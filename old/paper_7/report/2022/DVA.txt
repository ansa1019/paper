the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements.
company overview our principal business is to provide dialysis and related lab services to patients in the united states, which we refer to as our u.s. dialysis business. we also operate our u.s. integrated kidney care (ikc) business, our u.s. other ancillary services, and our international operations, which we collectively refer to as our ancillary services, as well as our corporate administrative support. our u.s. dialysis business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services in the u.s. for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end stage renal disease (esrd) or end stage kidney disease (eskd).
on june 19, 2019, we completed the sale of our prior davita medical group (dmg) business to collaborative care holdings, llc, a subsidiary of unitedhealth group inc. the effects of the dmg sale have been reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented and dmg is not included below in this management's discussion and analysis.
we continued to experience challenges related to the coronavirus pandemic (covid-19) and certain interrelated macroeconomic developments and conditions which negatively impacted our year-over-year revenue and treatment volumes in 2022. we also incurred higher compensation expense and advocacy spend in 2022, as well as increases in severance costs and center closures costs as we continue to focus on cost savings initiatives. in addition, 2022 was negatively impacted by our increased investment in our integrated care support functions needed to support the ikc patient growth. these negative trends were partially offset by increased u.s. dialysis average patient services revenue per treatment and continued growth in international businesses. in addition our 2022 financial performance benefited from lower pharmaceutical unit costs and intensity, health benefits expenses and medical supply expense as compared to the prior year.
operational and financial highlights for 2022 include, among other things:
•total u.s. dialysis revenue benefited from an increase in average patient services revenue per treatment growth of $6.00 per treatment offset by a decrease in the number of treatments primarily due to increased mortality due to covid-19's impact on our patient population;
•total revenue growth of 8.3% in our ikc business and 3.6% in our international operations;
•operating income of $1,339 million and adjusted operating income of $1,450 million;
•operating cash flows of $1,565 million and free cash flows of $817 million; and
•repurchase of 8,094,661 shares of our common stock for aggregate consideration of $788 million, and a 7.1% reduction in our share count year-over-year.
additional highlights include:
•net decrease of 91 u.s. dialysis centers to improve center capacity and utilization, as well as a net increase of 11 international dialysis centers from acquisitions;
•continued patient growth in ikc to 42,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements and an additional 15,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements; and
•the continued impact of covid-19 and other macroeconomic conditions.
in 2023, we expect that covid-19 and certain macroeconomic conditions will continue to impact our business and financial performance though the cumulative magnitude of these impacts remains difficult to predict and subject to significant uncertainty due to a number of factors, as described in further detail below under the heading "covid-19, general economic and marketplace conditions, and legal and regulatory developments." on treatment volume, we continue to face pressure primarily driven by the impact of covid-19 on the mortality rates of dialysis patients, as well as the direct and indirect impact of covid-19 on our missed treatment rate and new admissions. we anticipate that this pressure also will be magnified by continued slowing industry growth and continued competitive activity in 2023. on reimbursement rate, we expect growth in aggregate, primarily due to the increase in medicare payment rates under the esrd prospective payment system as well as a continuing increase in anticipated medicare advantage enrollment due to the 21st century cures act, partially offset by a full year of the resumption of medicare sequestration. on cost, we continue to expect increasing pressure on wage rates and other costs due to the challenging labor market and inflationary conditions and increased severance costs as we focus on efficiencies in our administrative support functions partially offset by continued anticipated savings on pharmaceutical costs and a decrease in depreciation and amortization. we expect to incur significantly less advocacy costs in 2023 than we experienced in 2022. we also expect to continue making investments to expand our ability to offer home-based dialysis service options and further advance our integrated care and value-based care initiatives in 2023. finally, considerable uncertainty exists surrounding the continued development of the various governmental laws, regulations and other requirements that impact our business.
the discussion below includes analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2022 compared to december 31, 2021. our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021, includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2020, in its part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations".
references to the "notes" in the discussion below refer to the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k at item 15, "exhibits, financial statement schedules" as referred from part ii item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
covid-19, general economic and marketplace conditions, and legal and regulatory developments as noted above and described in further detail below, the continued impacts on our business in connection with the covid-19 pandemic and general economic and market conditions could have a material adverse impact on our patients, teammates, physician partners, suppliers, business, operations, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or liquidity. many of these external factors and conditions are interrelated, including, among other things, supply chain challenges, inflation, rising interest rates, labor market conditions and wage pressure. certain of these impacts could be further intensified by concurrent global events such as the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine, which has continued to drive sociopolitical and economic uncertainty and volatility in europe and across the globe.
operational and financial impacts in 2022 we continued to experience a negative impact on revenue and non-acquired growth from covid-19 due to lower treatment volumes. as noted above, these lower treatment volumes were driven primarily by the negative impact of covid-19 on the mortality rates of our patients, which has in turn impacted our patient census, as well as the direct and indirect impact of covid-19 on our missed treatment rate and new admissions. we expect that the impact of covid-19 is likely to continue to negatively impact our revenue and non-acquired growth for a period of time even as the pandemic subsides due to the compounding impact of mortalities, among other things. during 2022, lower treatment volumes were also driven in part by declining new admissions and elevated missed treatment rates. new admission rates, future revenues and non-acquired growth could also continue to be negatively impacted over time to the extent that the ckd population experiences elevated mortality levels due to the pandemic. there remains significant uncertainty as to the ultimate impact of covid-19 on our treatment volumes, in part due to, among other things, the indeterminate severity and duration of the pandemic and the complexity of factors that may drive new admissions and missed treatment rates over time. depending on the ultimate severity and duration of the pandemic, the magnitude of these cumulative impacts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
covid-19 and other global conditions have also increased, and will continue to increase, our expenses, including, among others, staffing and labor costs. in 2022, we incurred higher than usual wage increases, and higher incentive pay. during 2022 we also incurred increased costs due to an increased utilization of contract labor, inefficient productivity and increased investment in training expenses. each of those cost drivers were in turn primarily the result of the combination of our ongoing covid-19-related clinical protocols and general labor, supply chain and inflationary pressures. as noted above, we expect certain of these increased costs to continue, and the cumulative impact of these costs could be material. in addition, potential staffing shortages or disruptions, if material, could ultimately lead to the unplanned closures of certain centers or adversely impact clinical operations, and may otherwise have a material adverse impact on our ability to provide dialysis services or the cost of providing those services, among other things. in 2022, we also saw a continued increase, relative to pre-pandemic conditions, in the effort and cost needed to procure certain of our equipment and clinical supplies, including pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment (ppe), and some of which have been substantial.
the staffing and labor cost inflation described above, in addition to higher equipment and clinical supply costs, have put pressure on our existing cost structure, and as noted above, we expect that certain of those increased costs will persist as global supply chains continue to experience volatility and disruptions and as inflationary pressures and challenging labor market conditions continue. prolonged volatility, uncertainty, labor supply shortages and other challenging labor market conditions could have an adverse impact on our growth and ability to execute on our other strategic initiatives and a material adverse impact on our labor costs. prolonged strain on global supply chains may result in equipment and clinical supply shortages, disruptions, delays or associated price increases that could impact our ability to provide dialysis services or the cost of providing those services, among other things. moreover, to the extent that inflationary pressure persists, this may in turn continue to increase our labor and supply costs at a rate that outpaces the medicare or any other rate increases we may receive. in our value-based care and other programs where we assume financial accountability for total patient cost, an increase in covid-19 rates among patients could have an impact on total cost of care. this increase may in turn impact the profitability of those programs relative to their respective funding.
as referenced above, we continue to implement cost savings opportunities to help mitigate these cost and volume pressures. these include, among other things, anticipated cost savings related to certain general and administrative cost efficiencies, such as ongoing initiatives that increase our use of third party service providers to perform certain activities, including, among others, finance and accounting functions as well as related information technology functions; initiatives relating to clinic optimization and initiatives for capacity utilization improvement; and procurement opportunities. we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, charges in connection with the continued implementation of these initiatives, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute these initiatives or that they will achieve expectations or succeed in helping offset the impact of these challenging conditions. any failure on our part to adjust our business and operations in this manner, to adjust to other marketplace developments or dynamics or to appropriately implement these initiatives in accordance with applicable legal, regulatory or compliance requirements could adversely impact our ability to provide dialysis services or the cost of providing those services, among other things, and ultimately could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
federal, state and local government response the government response to covid-19 has been wide-ranging and will continue to develop over time. as a result, we may not be able to accurately predict the nature, timing or extent of the impact of such changes on the markets in which we conduct business or on the other participants that operate in those markets, or any potential changes to the extensive set of federal, state and local laws, regulations and requirements that govern our business. for example, federal covid-19 relief legislation suspended the 2% medicare sequestration from may 1, 2020 through march 31, 2022. the medicare sequestration was reinstated in stages until the full 2% level was resumed as of july 1, 2022. while in effect, the suspension of sequestration significantly increased our revenues.
we believe the ultimate impact of the covid-19 pandemic and the aforementioned general economic and marketplace conditions on the company over time will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. with respect to covid-19, these future developments include, among other things, the ultimate severity and duration of the pandemic; the evolution of new strains or variants of the virus that may present varying levels of infectivity or virulence; covid-19's impact on the ckd patient population and our patient population, including on the mortality of these patients; the availability, acceptance, impact and efficacy of covid-19 vaccines, treatments and therapies; the pandemic's continuing impact on our revenue and non-acquired growth due to lower treatment volumes; the potential negative impact on our commercial mix or the number of patients covered by commercial insurance plans; continued increased covid-related costs; supply chain challenges and disruptions, including with respect to our clinical supplies; the responses of our competitors to the pandemic and related changes in the marketplace; the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local government responses; and any potential changes to the extensive set of federal, state and local laws, regulations and requirements that govern our business. in certain cases, the impact of the pandemic on us may persist even after the pandemic subsides. covid-19 has also intensified certain of the aforementioned general economic and marketplace conditions and developments in the u.s. and global economies, including labor market conditions, inflation and monetary policies, among others. we expect that these conditions will continue to impact our business in 2023.
for additional discussion of the covid-19 pandemic and our response, the various general economic and marketplace conditions that may impact our business, and the risks and uncertainties related to each of these, please see the discussion in part i item 1. business under the headings, "covid-19 and its impact on our business" and "human capital management," as well as the risk factors in part i item 1a. risk factors, including, among others, the risks under the headings, "macroeconomic conditions and global events..." and "if we are unable to compete successfully...".
legal and regulatory developments in 2022, the u.s. supreme court issued a decision in the matter of marietta memorial hospital employee health benefit plan, et al. v. davita inc., et al., a case evaluating the scope of the medicare secondary payor act (mspa), deciding that a group health plan that provides limited benefits for outpatient dialysis, but does so uniformly for all plan participants, does not violate the terms of the mspa because the plan treats all patients uniformly, regardless of whether a participant has esrd and regardless of whether the participant is eligible for medicare. for additional information, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and the risk factor in part i item 1a. risk factors under the heading "if the number or percentage of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines..." there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate impact of the decision, but if a significant number of commercial plans, including employer group health plans, implement or utilize plan designs that discourage or prevent esrd patients from retaining their commercial coverage, it may lead to a decrease in the number of patients with commercial plans, the duration of benefits for patients under commercial plans and/or decrease in the payment rates we receive, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

u.s. dialysis business as of december 31, 2022, our u.s. dialysis business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services, operating 2,724 outpatient dialysis centers serving a total of approximately 199,400 patients, and contracted to provide hospital inpatient dialysis services in approximately 820 hospitals. we estimate that we have approximately a 36% share of the u.s. dialysis market based upon the number of patients we serve.
approximately 91% of our 2022 consolidated revenues were derived directly from our u.s. dialysis business. the principal drivers of our u.s. dialysis revenues include    :
•our number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three in-center treatments per week as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for home-based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis; and
•our average dialysis patient service revenue per treatment, including the mix of patients with commercial plans and government programs as primary payor.
within our u.s. dialysis business, our home-based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services are operationally integrated with our outpatient dialysis centers and related laboratory services. our outpatient, home-based and hospital inpatient dialysis services comprise approximately 76%, 18% and 6% of our u.s. dialysis revenues, respectively.
in the u.s., government dialysis-related payment rates are principally determined by federal medicare and state medicaid policy. for 2022, approximately 67% of our total u.s. dialysis patient services revenues were generated from government-based programs for services to approximately 90% of our total u.s. patients. these government-based programs are principally medicare and medicare advantage, medicaid and managed medicaid plans, and other government plans, representing approximately 57%, 7% and 3% of our u.s. dialysis patient services revenues, respectively.
on october 31, 2022, cms issued a final rule to update the esrd pps payment rate and policies, as described further above. cms estimates the final rule will affect esrd facilities' average reimbursement by a productivity-adjusted market basket increase of 3.0% in 2023.
dialysis payment rates from commercial payors vary and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. on average, dialysis-related payment rates from contracted commercial payors are significantly higher than medicare, medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients in relation to total patients represents a significant driver of our total average dialysis patient service revenue per treatment. commercial payors (including hospital dialysis services) represent approximately 33% of u.s. dialysis patient services revenues.
for discussion of government reimbursement, the medicare esrd bundled payment system, medicare advantage and commercial reimbursement, see the discussion in part i. item 1. business under the heading "u.s. dialysis business - sources of revenue-concentrations and risks." for a discussion of operational, clinical and financial risks and uncertainties that we face in connection with the medicare esrd bundled payment system, see the risk factor in part i. item 1a. risk factors under the heading "our business is subject to a complex set of governmental laws, regulations and other requirements and any failure to adhere to those requirements, or any changes in those requirements..." for a discussion of operational, clinical and financial risks and uncertainties that we face in connection with commercial payors, see the risk factor in item 1a. risk factors under the heading "if the number or percentage of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, if the average rates that commercial payors pay us declines..."
approximately 1% of our total u.s. dialysis patient services revenues for each of the years 2022 and 2021 were associated with the administration of separately-billable physician-prescribed pharmaceuticals, the majority of which relate to the administration of calcimimetics.
we anticipate that we will continue to experience increases in our operating costs in 2023 that may outpace any net medicare, commercial or other rate increases that we may receive, which could significantly impact our operating results. in particular, we expect to continue experiencing increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, including increases in maintenance costs, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in medicare, commercial or other payor payment rates. we also continue to expect to incur additional covid-19-related costs while the pandemic continues. in addition, we expect to continue to incur capital expenditures and associated depreciation and amortization to improve, renovate and maintain our facilities, equipment and information technology to meet evolving regulatory requirements and otherwise.
u.s. dialysis patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers, home-based dialysis programs and hospital inpatient dialysis programs, and consist principally of labor, benefits, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other operating costs of the dialysis centers.
the principal drivers of our u.s. dialysis patient care costs include:
•clinical hours per treatment, labor rates and benefit costs;
•vendor pricing and utilization levels of pharmaceuticals;
•business infrastructure costs, which include the operating costs of our dialysis centers; and
•medical supply costs.
other cost categories that can present significant variability include insurance costs and professional fees. in addition, proposed ballot initiatives or referendums, legislation, regulations or policy changes could cause us to incur substantial costs to prepare for, or implement changes required. any such changes could result in, among other things, increases in our labor costs or limitations on the amount of revenue that we can retain. for additional information on risks associated with potential and proposed ballot initiatives, referendums, legislation, regulations or policy changes, see the risk factor in item 1a. risk factors under the heading, "changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations..."
our average clinical hours per treatment increased in 2022 compared to 2021. we are always striving for improved productivity levels, however, changes in factors such as federal and state policies or regulatory billing requirements can lead to increased labor costs. in 2022, the demand for skilled clinical personnel continued, exacerbated by the nationwide shortage caused by the continuing covid-19 pandemic on these resources. in 2022 and 2021, we experienced increases in our clinical labor rates of approximately 7.4% and 3.9%, respectively. we expect to continue to see higher clinical labor rates and continued use of contract labor in 2023 due to the labor market conditions and the continued competition for skilled clinical personnel. in 2022, our overall clinical teammate turnover increased from 2021. we also continue to experience increases in the infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers and general increases in rent and repairs and maintenance. in 2022, we continued to implement certain cost control initiatives to help manage our overall operating costs, including labor productivity, and we expect to continue these initiatives in 2023.
our u.s. dialysis general and administrative expenses represented 9.8% and 8.7% of our u.s. dialysis revenues in 2022 and 2021, respectively. increases in general and administrative expenses over the last several years were primarily related to strengthening our dialysis business and related compliance and operational processes, responding to certain legal and compliance matters, professional fees associated with enhancing our information technology (it) systems, such as our new clinical system, and more recently advocacy costs in 2022 related to countering union policy efforts and severance costs related to planned administrative efficiencies. we expect that these levels of general and administrative expenses will be impacted by lower advocacy costs in 2023 compared to 2022, continued investment in developing our capabilities and executing on our strategic priorities, as well as additional severance costs as we implement the planned administrative efficiencies, among other things.

(1)normalized non-acquired treatment growth reflects year over year growth in treatment volume, adjusted to exclude acquisitions and other similar transactions, and further adjusted to normalize for the number and mix of treatment days in a given period versus the prior period.
our u.s. dialysis treatment volume is directly correlated with our operating revenues and expenses. the decrease in our u.s. dialysis treatments in 2022 was primarily driven by the impact of increased mortality over recent periods on our patient population, and higher missed treatment rates, slightly offset by acquisition related growth. we believe the increased mortality rate is largely attributable to the impact of covid-19 on our patient population.

(1)general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022 included advocacy costs of approximately $51 million incurred to counter union policy efforts, including a california statewide ballot initiative (ca proposition 29).
charges impacting operating income closure costs. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we incurred higher than normal charges for center capacity closures. these closures were the result of a strategic review of our outpatient clinic capacity requirements and utilization, which have been impacted both by declines in our patient census in some markets due to the covid-19 pandemic, as well as by our initiatives toward, and advances in, increasing the proportion of our home dialysis patients.
our 2022 charges for u.s. dialysis center closures were approximately $86 million, which increased our patient care costs by $21 million, our general and administrative expenses by $19 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by $46 million. by comparison, 2021 charges for u.s. dialysis center closures were approximately $18 million, which increased our patient care costs by $2 million, our general and administrative expenses by $3 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by $12 million. these capacity closures costs included net losses on assets retired, lease costs, asset impairments and accelerated depreciation and amortization.
we will continue to optimize our u.s. dialysis center footprint through center mergers and/or closures and expect our center closure rates to remain at elevated levels over the next several quarters.
severance costs. during the fourth quarter of 2022, we committed to a plan to increase efficiencies and cost savings in certain general and administrative support functions. as a result of this plan, we recognized expenses related to termination and other benefit commitments in our u.s. dialysis business of $17 million.
patient care costs. u.s. dialysis patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of compensation expenses including labor and benefits, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other operating costs of the dialysis centers.
u.s. dialysis patient care costs per treatment increased primarily due to increases in compensation expenses including increased wage rates and contract wages. other drivers of this increase include increases in other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, including increases in utilities expense partially due to lower expense in 2021 related to our virtual power purchase arrangements, as well as center closure costs, as described above, insurance expenses and costs related to travel. in addition, our fixed other direct operating expenses negatively impacted patient care costs per treatment due to our decrease in treatments in 2022. these increases were partially offset by decreases in pharmaceutical unit costs, health benefit expenses and medical supply costs.
general and administrative expenses. u.s. dialysis general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases in advocacy costs to counter union policy efforts, compensation expenses including increased wage rates and severance costs, as described above, travel costs, center closure, as described above, and higher it-related costs. this increase in u.s. dialysis general and administrative expenses was partially offset by gains recognized on the sale of our self-developed properties, and decreases in professional fees and contributions to our charitable foundation.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense is directly impacted by the number of dialysis centers and the information technology that we develop and acquire as well as changes in useful lives. u.s. dialysis depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2022 primarily due to accelerated depreciation for expected center closures, as described above, increased depreciation and amortization for hardware associated with our new clinical system and other corporate technology projects and the development of new centers.
equity investment income. u.s. dialysis equity investment income decreased primarily due to a decline in profitability at certain nonconsolidated dialysis partnerships.

u.s. dialysis operating income was negatively impacted by center closure and severance costs, as described above. operating income and adjusted operating income decreased compared to 2021 primarily due to decreased dialysis treatments and increases in compensation expenses, advocacy costs, other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, costs related to travel, depreciation expense related to it projects and insurance expenses, each described above. operating income and adjusted operating income were positively impacted by an increase in our average patient service revenue per treatment, as described above, as well as decreases in pharmaceutical unit costs, gains on sale of our self-developed properties and decreases in health benefit expenses and medical supply costs.
other - ancillary services our other operations include ancillary services that are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. as of december 31, 2022, these consisted primarily of our u.s. integrated kidney care (ikc) business, certain u.s. other ancillary businesses (including our clinical research programs, transplant software business, and venture investment group), and our international operations.
these ancillary services, including our international operations, generated revenues of approximately $1.101 billion in 2022, representing approximately 9% of our consolidated revenues.
as of december 31, 2022, davita ikc provided integrated care and disease management services to approximately 42,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements and to an additional 15,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements. we also expect to add additional service offerings to our business and pursue additional strategic initiatives in the future as circumstances warrant, which could include, among other things, healthcare services not related to dialysis.
for a discussion of the risks related to ikc and our ancillary services, see the discussion in the risk factors in item 1a. risk factors under the headings, "the u.s. ancillary services and strategic initiatives and international operations that we operate or invest in now or in the future..." and "if we are not able to successfully implement our strategy with respect to our integrated kidney care and value-based care initiatives..."
as of december 31, 2022, our international dialysis business owned or operated 350 outpatient dialysis centers located in 11 countries outside of the u.s. for 2022, total revenues generated from our international operations were approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues.

revenues:
our ikc revenues were impacted by an increase in shared savings, including savings from new programs, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our special needs plans. our other u.s. ancillary services revenues increased due to revenues from our newly acquired transplant software business, partially offset by decreased revenues in our clinical research programs. our international revenues increased primarily due to acquisition-related growth, partially offset by the impact of increased mortality over recent periods on our patient population.
charges impacting operating income - severance and other costs.
during the fourth quarter of 2022, similar to u.s. dialysis, we committed to a plan to increase efficiencies and cost savings in certain general and administrative support functions and other overhead costs. as a result of this plan, we recognized expenses related to termination and other benefit commitments in our ikc business and these expenses and other charges in our international operations of $0.5 million and $7.5 million, respectively.
operating loss and adjusted operating loss:
our ikc operating loss and adjusted operating loss increased primarily due to continued investments in our integrated care support functions, partially offset by an increase in shared savings and improved performance in our special needs plans. our other u.s. ancillary services operating loss was impacted by a benefit received from run-off of a legacy business recognized in 2021 and decreased revenues in our clinical research programs in 2022. our international operating income was impacted by severance and other costs in one of our international businesses, as described above. international operating income and adjusted operating income were impacted by acquisition-related growth, partially offset by the impact of increased mortality over recent periods on our patient population and losses on foreign exchange compared to gains in the prior year.
corporate administrative support corporate administrative support consists primarily of labor, benefits and long-term incentive compensation expense, as well as professional fees, for departments which provide support to all of our various operating lines of business. corporate administrative support expenses are included in general and administrative expenses on our consolidated income statement.
corporate administrative support expenses increased $18 million primarily driven by increased legal fees and compensation expenses. these increases were partially offset by decreased long-term incentive compensation expense.

(1)for a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate from continuing operations attributable to davita inc., see the "reconciliations of non-gaap measures" section below.
debt expense debt expense increased primarily due to an increase in our overall weighted average effective interest rate and weighted average credit facility balance outstanding, which included draws on our revolving line of credit during 2022. our overall weighted average effective interest rate on all debt, including the effect of interest rate caps and amortization of debt discount, was 3.96% in 2022 compared to 3.28% in 2021. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the components of our debt and changes in them since 2021.
other (loss) income other (loss) income consists primarily of interest income on cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments, realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized on investments, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. other income decreased primarily due to increased losses on investments in 2022, partially offset by an increase in interest income.
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate and effective income tax rate from continuing operations attributable to davita inc. increased in 2022 primarily due to increases in nondeductible advocacy expenses, foreign tax provision expense and a reduction in benefits from stock-based compensation. these increases were partially offset by benefits recognized in 2022 for uncertain tax positions outside the statute of limitations and a reduction in tax expense recognized in 2021 for deferred re-measurement. additionally, our effective income tax rate was impacted by the portion of earnings attributable to our non-controlling interests.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests the decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2022 compared to 2021 was due to a decrease in earnings at certain u.s. dialysis partnerships.
accounts receivable our consolidated accounts receivable balances at december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021 were $2.132 billion and $1.958 billion, respectively, representing approximately 68 days and 62 days of revenue (dso), respectively. the increase in consolidated dso resulted primarily from an increase of five days of dso in our u.s. dialysis business, primarily due to delays in collections related to certain payors, temporary billing holds and changes in payor mix related to the continued shift to medicare advantage plans for which average collection times are longer than that of medicare. our dso calculation is based on the most recent quarter's average revenues per day. there were no significant changes during 2022 from 2021 in the carrying amount of accounts receivable outstanding over one year old or in the amounts pending approval from third-party payors.
as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, our patient services accounts receivable balances that are more than six months old represented approximately 18% and 16%, respectively, of our total accounts receivable balances outstanding. substantially all revenue realized for patient services is received from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. less than 1% of our revenues in both periods were classified as patient pay.
amounts pending approval from third-party payors associated with medicare bad debt claims as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $111 million and $133 million, respectively, and are classified as other receivables. a significant portion of our medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims but are subject to subsequent adjustment based upon the actual results of those audits. such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed.

consolidated cash flows consolidated cash flows from operating activities for 2022 and 2021 were $1,565 million and $1,931 million, respectively. the decrease in cash flow from continuing operations was primarily driven by decreased earnings from operations and increases in tax and interest payments, partially offset by timing of working capital items.
cash flows used for investing activities in 2022 decreased $155 million compared to 2021 primarily due to decreases in acquisition expenditures combined with an increase in proceeds from the sale of self-developed properties, which was principally driven by the sale of one of our self-developed properties.
cash flows used in financing activities increased $38 million in 2022 compared to 2021. significant sources of cash during 2022 included a net draw of $165 million on our revolving line of credit. significant uses of cash during 2022 consisted primarily of regularly scheduled mandatory principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling approximately $98 million on term loan a and $27 million on term loan b-1 and additional required principal payments under other debt arrangements. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2022 we used cash to repurchase 8,094,661 shares of our common stock.
by comparison, 2021 included the issuance of $1,000 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes as an add-on offering to our 4.625% senior notes due 2030 which were issued at an offering price of 101.750% of the principal amount in february 2021. significant uses of cash during 2021 consisted primarily of the repayment in full of $75 million of borrowings under our revolving line of credit, net payments of regularly scheduled mandatory principal amounts due under our senior secured credit facilities totaling approximately $88 million on term loan a and $27 million on term loan b-1 and additional required principal payments under other debt arrangements. in addition, we incurred bond issuance costs of approximately $9 million. during the year ended december 31, 2021 we used cash to repurchase 13,877,193 shares of our common stock.
dialysis center capacity and growth we are typically able to increase our capacity by extending hours at our existing dialysis centers, expanding our existing dialysis centers, relocating our dialysis centers, developing new dialysis centers and by acquiring dialysis centers. the development of a typical new outpatient dialysis center generally requires approximately $2.0 million for leasehold improvements and other capital expenditures. based on our experience, a new outpatient dialysis center typically opens within a year after the property lease is signed, normally achieves operating profitability in the second year after medicare certification, and normally reaches maturity within three to five years. acquiring an existing outpatient dialysis center requires a substantially greater initial investment, but profitability and cash flows are generally accelerated and more predictable. to a limited extent, we enter into agreements to provide management and administrative services to outpatient dialysis centers in which we own a noncontrolling interest or which are wholly-owned by third parties in return for management fees.

subsequent to december 31, 2022, we did not repurchase any shares through february 22, 2023. we retired all shares of common stock held in treasury effective december 31, 2022 and 2021.
see further discussion of our share repurchase activity and authorizations in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
available liquidity as of december 31, 2022, our cash balance was $244 million and we held approximately $78 million in short-term investments. at that time we also had $165 million outstanding and $835 million available on our $1.0 billion revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facilities. credit available under this revolving line of credit is reduced by the amount of any letters of credit outstanding thereunder, of which there were none as of december 31, 2022. as of december 31, 2022 we separately had approximately $109 million in letters of credit outstanding under a separate bilateral secured letter of credit facility.
see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for components of our long-term debt and their interest rates.
the covid-19 pandemic and certain economic and marketplace conditions, including inflationary and labor pressures, have driven increased pressure on our cash flows. as of the date of this report, we have not experienced a material deterioration in our liquidity position as a result of covid-19 or those global economic and market conditions. the ultimate impact of the pandemic and those economic and market conditions will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.
we believe that our cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, including from amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our access to the capital markets, will be sufficient to fund our scheduled debt service under the terms of our debt agreements and other obligations for the foreseeable future, including the next 12 months. our primary recurrent sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings, which are subject to general, economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, as described in item 1a. risk factors under the heading "the level of our current and future debt..."
reconciliations of non-gaap measures the following tables provide reconciliations of adjusted operating income (loss) to operating income (loss) as presented on a u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) basis for our u.s. dialysis reportable segment as well as for our u.s. ikc business, our u.s. other ancillary services, our international business, and for our total ancillary services which combines them and is disclosed as our other segments category, in addition to our corporate administrative support. these non-gaap or "adjusted" measures are presented because management believes these measures are useful adjuncts to, but not alternatives for, our gaap results.
specifically, management uses adjusted operating income (loss) to compare and evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. we believe this non-gaap measure is also useful to investors and analysts in evaluating our performance over time and relative to competitors, as well as in analyzing the underlying trends in our business. we also believe this presentation enhances a user's understanding of our normal operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations.
in addition, our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations attributable to davita inc. excludes noncontrolling owners' income, which primarily relates to non-tax paying entities. we believe this adjusted effective income tax rate is useful to management, investors and analysts in evaluating our performance and establishing expectations for income taxes incurred on our ordinary results attributable to davita inc.
finally, our free cash flow from continuing operations represents net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less distributions to noncontrolling interests and all capital expenditures (including development capital expenditures, routine maintenance and information technology), plus contributions from noncontrolling interests and proceeds from the sale of self-developed properties. management uses this measure to assess our ability to fund acquisitions and meet our debt service obligations and we believe this measure is equally useful to investors and analysts as an adjunct to cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations and other measures under gaap.
it is important to bear in mind that these non-gaap "adjusted" measures are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation from, nor as substitutes for, their most comparable gaap measures.

off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in addition to the debt obligations and operating lease liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with letters of credit as well as certain working capital funding obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated dialysis ventures that we manage and some we manage that are wholly-owned by third parties.
we also have potential obligations to purchase the noncontrolling interests held by third parties in many of our majority-owned dialysis partnerships and other nonconsolidated entities. these obligations are in the form of put provisions that are exercisable at the third-party owners' discretion within specified periods as outlined in each specific put provision. for additional information see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

as of december 31, 2022 we had outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $109 million under a separate bilateral secured letter of credit facility.
as of december 31, 2022 we have outstanding purchase agreements with various suppliers to purchase set amounts of dialysis equipment, parts, pharmaceuticals, and supplies. if we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitments under these contracts during any year, we are required to pay the difference to the supplier. for additional information see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
we also have certain potential commitments to provide working capital funding, if necessary, to certain nonconsolidated dialysis businesses that we manage and in which we own a noncontrolling equity interest or which are wholly-owned by third parties. for additional information see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
additionally, we expect our 2023 capital expenditures to be in alignment with 2022 capital expenditures.
in addition, we have approximately $54 million of existing long-term income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, which are excluded from the table above as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made.
finally, on may 25, 2022, we entered into an agreement with medtronic, inc. and one of its subsidiaries (collectively, medtronic) to form a new, independent kidney care-focused medical device company (newco). the transaction is expected to close in 2023, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. at close, we will make a cash payment to medtronic of approximately $75 million, subject to certain customary adjustments prior to the closing, and will contribute certain other non-cash assets to newco valued at approximately $25 million. additionally, at close, each of davita and medtronic will contribute approximately $200 million in cash to launch newco. we also agreed to pay medtronic additional consideration of up to $300 million if certain regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved between 2024 and 2028.
contingencies the information in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item.
critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles. these accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, contingencies and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions (redeemable equity interests). all significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. actual results will generally differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on-going actual experience trends or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, fair value estimates for goodwill and noncontrolling interests, accounting for income taxes, and loss contingencies are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. for additional information, see part ii item 15, "exhibits, financial statement schedules" - note 1 - "organization and summary of significant accounting policies" as referred from part ii item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
u.s. dialysis revenue recognition and accounts receivable. there are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of u.s. dialysis revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. in addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. the measurement and recognition of revenue requires the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters.
revenues associated with medicare and medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs providing secondary coverage (e.g., medicaid secondary coverage), the patient's commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. our dialysis-related reimbursements from medicare are subject to certain variations under medicare's single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics and other variable factors. our revenue recognition depends upon our ability to effectively capture, document and bill for medicare's base payment rate and these other factors. in addition, as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our dialysis-related reimbursements from medicare under the single bundled payment rate system, our revenue recognition is subject to a greater degree of estimating risk.
commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed-care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients covered under commercial healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non-contracted commercial healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, the estimated timing of collections, changes in our expectations of the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance matters. determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our approximately 199,400 u.s. dialysis patients at any given point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided.
we generally expect the range of our u.s. dialysis revenue estimating risk to be within 1% of revenue, which can represent as much as approximately 5% of our u.s. dialysis business's adjusted operating income. changes in estimates are reflected in the then-current financial statements based on on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant.
revenues for laboratory services, which are integrally related to our dialysis services, are recognized in the period services are provided at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received.
certain fair value estimates. fair value measurements and estimates affect, or potentially affect, a variety of elements in the company's financial statements. two of the elements most significantly impacted by fair value estimates are the company's goodwill impairment assessments and remeasurements of its noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions balance.
goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed for impairment when changes in circumstances warrant and at least annually. an impairment charge is recorded when and to the extent a reporting unit's carrying amount is determined to exceed its estimated fair value. changes in circumstance that may trigger a goodwill impairment assessment for one of our business units can include, among others, changes in the legal environment, addressable market, business strategy, development or business plans, reimbursement structure or rates, operating performance, future prospects, relationships with partners, interest rates and/or market value indications for the subject business. we use a variety of factors to assess changes in the financial condition, future prospects and other circumstances for businesses subject to goodwill impairment assessment. however, these assessments and the related valuations can involve significant uncertainties and require significant judgment on various matters. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a sensitivity summary on the company's reporting units considered at risk of goodwill impairment as of december 31, 2022.
the company is also required to remeasure its noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions to estimated fair value each reporting period. these estimates also require substantive judgment on meaningful uncertainties concerning this significant balance. see notes 17 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the company's approach to these valuations, the variables and uncertainties involved, and the sensitivity of these valuations to changes in a primary aggregate valuation metric.
accounting for income taxes. our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous state and foreign jurisdictions, and changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. the actual impact of any such laws or regulations could be materially different from our current estimates.
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense. deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, results of recent operations, and assumptions about the amount of future federal, state, and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgments and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. the allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets.
loss contingencies. as discussed in notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, we operate in a highly regulated industry and are party to various lawsuits, claims, qui tam suits, governmental investigations and audits (including, without limitation, investigations or other actions resulting from our obligation to self-report suspected violations of law), contract disputes and other legal proceedings. assessments of such matters can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. we record accruals for loss contingencies on such matters to the extent that we determine an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion.
significant new accounting standards see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for information regarding certain recent financial accounting standards that have been issued by the financial accounting standards board (fasb).

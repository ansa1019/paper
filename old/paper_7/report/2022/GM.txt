item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this md&a should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes. forward-looking statements in this md&a are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. refer to the "forward-looking statements" section of this md&a and part i, item 1a. risk factors for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2020 included in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021 is incorporated by reference into this md&a.
non-gaap measures  our non-gaap measures include: earnings before interest and taxes (ebit)-adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests; earnings before income taxes (ebt)-adjusted for our gm financial segment; earnings per share (eps)-diluted-adjusted; effective tax rate-adjusted (etr-adjusted); return on invested capital-adjusted (roic-adjusted) and adjusted automotive free cash flow. our calculation of these non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. as a result, the use of these non-gaap measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related u.s. gaap measures.
these non-gaap measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. furthermore, these non-gaap measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve roic-adjusted. management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. further, our board of directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. for these reasons, we believe these non-gaap measures are useful for our investors.
general motors company and subsidiaries ebit-adjusted ebit-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. examples of adjustments to ebit include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. for ebit-adjusted and our other non-gaap measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-gaap measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. our corresponding measure for our gm financial segment is ebt-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.
eps-diluted-adjusted eps-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted eps results on a consistent basis. eps-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less adjustments noted above for ebit-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
etr-adjusted etr-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. etr-adjusted is calculated as income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for ebit-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for eps-diluted-adjusted divided by income before income taxes less adjustments. when we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the u.s. gaap measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.
roic-adjusted roic-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions. we define roic-adjusted as ebit-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by roic-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (opeb) liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.
adjusted automotive free cash flow adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. we measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for ebit-adjusted purposes. refer to the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a for additional information.

overview our vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-focused strategy to invest in evs and avs, software-enabled services and subscriptions and new business opportunities, while strengthening our market position in profitable ice vehicles, such as trucks and suvs. we will execute our strategy with a diverse team and a steadfast commitment to good citizenship through sustainable operations and a leading health and safety culture.
the automotive industry and gm continue to experience supply chain and logistics disruptions from multiple suppliers that have impacted, and may continue to impact, our planned production schedules. despite these challenges, in the second half of 2022, we experienced improved parts availability that enabled us to increase production and improve dealer inventory levels for certain vehicles.
in addition, we faced significant inflationary pressure in 2022 that resulted in approximately $5.5 billion in higher commodity and logistics costs. these increases were more than offset by strong product pricing. while we anticipate incentives to increase from the low levels in 2022, we expect product pricing to remain strong in 2023, particularly for our full-size suvs, full-size trucks and expected new launches. we also expect commodity and logistics cost to improve, but be partially offset by costs we expect to incur as we strategically localize our battery raw materials supply chain in north america. refer to the consolidated results and regional analysis sections of this md&a for additional information.
in 2022, the board of governors of the federal reserve system raised interest rates to lower the rate of inflation. the higher interest rate environment did not have a material impact on our 2022 financial results, but we expect it will have an approximately $1.0 billion unfavorable impact on our results of operations in 2023, as a result of lower forecasted pension income. refer to the critical accounting estimates section of this md&a for additional information including our interest rate sensitivity analysis. we expect higher interest rates to have an immaterial impact on our automotive interest expense in 2023, as substantially all of our debt instruments are fixed rate. for a discussion of the net interest income sensitivity of gm financial, see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. furthermore, holding other factors constant, the higher interest rate environment may decrease the affordability of our vehicles for customers who rely on financing to purchase a vehicle.
we also face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in several countries across the globe due to, among other factors, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emission standards, potentially weakening economic conditions, labor disruptions, foreign exchange volatility, evolving trade policy and political uncertainty. refer to part i, item 1a. risk factors for a discussion of these challenges.
we also continue to monitor the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, and government actions and measures taken to prevent its spread, and the potential to affect our operations. refer to part i, item 1a. risk factors for further discussion of these risks.
general motors company and subsidiaries as we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business, additional restructuring and rationalization actions could be required. these actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results.
on august 16, 2022, the inflation reduction act of 2022 (the "act") was signed into law. the act implements a new 15% corporate minimum tax based on modified u.s. financial statement net income that is effective beginning in 2023. the new corporate minimum tax is not expected to have a significant impact on our net earnings or cash flow in 2023. the act also modified climate and clean energy corporate tax provisions, including the consumer credit for ev purchases, and beginning in 2023, new tax credits for commercial ev purchases and investments in clean energy production, supply chains and manufacturing facilities became effective. we expect to generate commercial ev tax credits and credits from our production of battery components that will increase net income and impact income tax cash payments. while waiting on pending department of treasury regulatory guidance, we are continuing to evaluate the ultimate impact of the tax credits on our financial results, including our net earnings and cash flow.
for the year ending december 31, 2023, we expect eps-diluted and eps-diluted-adjusted of between $6.00 and $7.00, net income attributable to stockholders of between $8.7 billion and $10.1 billion and ebit-adjusted of between $10.5 billion and $12.5 billion. we do not consider the potential impact of future adjustments on our expected financial results.

gmna industry sales in north america were 17.3 million units in the year ended december 31, 2022, representing a decrease of 6.6% compared to the corresponding period in 2021. u.s. industry sales were 14.2 million units in the year ended december 31, 2022, representing a decrease of 7.9% compared to the corresponding period in 2021. the covid-19 pandemic originally resulted in a contraction of total north america industry volumes in 2020 that continued through 2022. dealer inventory remains constrained for several critical vehicles, including our full-size suvs.
our total vehicle sales in the u.s., our largest market in north america, were 2.3 million units for a market share of 16.0% in the year ended december 31, 2022, representing an increase of 1.6 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2021.
we expect to sustain relatively strong ebit-adjusted margins in 2023 on the continued strength of vehicle pricing and healthy u.s. industry light vehicle demand, partially offset by elevated costs associated with commodities, raw materials and logistics. our outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of supply chain availability and overall economic conditions. as a result of supply chain disruptions in 2022, we experienced interruptions to our planned production schedules and prioritized production of our most popular and in-demand products, including our full-size trucks, full-size suvs and evs.
in 2023, our collective bargaining agreements with the uaw in the united states and unifor in canada, as well as collective bargaining agreements in mexico, will expire, which will require negotiation of new agreements. refer to part i, item 1a. risk factors for a discussion of the risks related to any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities.
gmi industry sales in china were 23.5 million units in the year ended december 31, 2022, representing a decrease of 9.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2021. our total vehicle sales in china were 2.3 million units resulting in a market share of 9.8% in the year ended december 31, 2022, representing a decrease of 1.4 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2021. the ongoing supply chain disruptions, macro-economic impact of covid-19 and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on china's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in china. our automotive china jvs general motors company and subsidiaries generated equity income of $0.7 billion in the year ended december 31, 2022. although price competition, higher costs associated with commodities and raw materials, and a more challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and nev requirements will place pressure on our operations in china, we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in china as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.
outside of china, industry sales were 23.7 million units in the year ended december 31, 2022, representing an increase of 2.5% compared to the corresponding period in 2021. our total vehicle sales outside of china were 1.0 million units for a market share of 4.0% in the year ended december 31, 2022, representing an increase of 0.4 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2021.
we historically operated a small import business in russia and sold gm-badged vehicles into russia through gm's alliance partner in uzbekistan. gm's direct and indirect profitability in russia was insignificant. with russia's invasion of ukraine, western sanctions on russia have and may continue to progressively increase. in addition, reputational, legal and other concerns impacted our ability to continue to operate in russia. in february 2022, we suspended our exports into russia and instructed our russian sales company to cease selling vehicles within russia. in april 2022, we took additional actions to extend the suspension of our russian business, including the cessation of commercial operations. in november 2022, we shut down our russia business and recorded a $0.7 billion charge to write off our net investment and release accumulated translation losses into earnings. the predominately non-cash charge associated with our exit is considered special for ebit-adjusted, adjusted automotive free cash flow and eps-diluted-adjusted purposes. currently, we do not believe any loss contingencies arising from our exit are probable and we are unable to estimate any reasonably possible losses that may result from claims that may be asserted against us by third parties, including retail customers or government authorities in russia.
we continue to monitor the situation and its macroeconomic impacts on our financial position and results of operations. although we have limited supply chain exposure to russia and ukraine, we are working closely with our supply base to mitigate any potential risks.
cruise  gated by safety and regulation, cruise continues to make significant progress towards commercialization of a network of on-demand avs in the united states and globally. in 2021, cruise received a driverless test permit from the california public utilities commission (cpuc) to provide unpaid rides to the public in driverless vehicles and received approval of its autonomous vehicle deployment permit from the california department of motor vehicles to commercially deploy driverless avs. in june 2022, cruise received the first ever driverless deployment permit granted by the cpuc, which allows them to charge a fare for the driverless rides they are providing to members of the public in certain parts of san francisco. additionally, in september 2022, cruise acquired regulatory permits to operate driverless ride hail services in phoenix, arizona and began pursuing ride hail operations in austin, texas. gm and cruise are also awaiting a decision on an exemption petition that was filed with nhtsa seeking regulatory approval for the deployment of the cruise origin. refer to the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a for information about gm's additional investment in cruise.
automotive financing - gm financial summary and outlook we believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental gm financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. gm financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. used vehicle prices were generally higher than contractual residual values in 2022, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. in 2023, we expect used vehicle prices to continue moderating through the year as market prices on used vehicles fall below contractual residual values. the increase in used vehicle prices resulted in gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $1.2 billion in gm financial interest, operating and other expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022, and $2.0 billion in the corresponding period in 2021. the following table summarizes the estimated residual value based on gm financial's most recent estimates and the number of units included in gm financial equipment on operating leases, net by vehicle type (units in thousands):

n.m. = not meaningful the most significant element of our automotive and other cost of sales is material cost, which makes up approximately two-thirds of the total amount. the remaining portion includes labor costs, depreciation and amortization, engineering, freight and product warranty and recall campaigns.
factors that most significantly influence a region's profitability are industry volume, market share, and the relative mix of vehicles (trucks, crossovers, cars) sold. variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. variable profit is defined as general motors company and subsidiaries revenue less material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. vehicles with higher selling prices generally have higher variable profit. refer to the regional sections of this md&a for additional information on volume and mix.
in the year ended december 31, 2022, increased cost was primarily due to: (1) increased material and freight costs of $5.5 billion; (2) increased costs of $1.1 billion primarily related to parts and accessories; (3) increased manufacturing costs of $1.1 billion; (4) increased engineering costs of $1.0 billion primarily related to accelerating our ev portfolio and an increase in development costs as cruise progresses towards the commercialization of a network of on-demand avs in the united states and globally; and (5) increased costs of $0.8 billion related to modification of cruise stock incentive awards; partially offset by (6) decreased campaigns and other warranty-related costs of $0.4 billion; and (7) a decrease of $0.4 billion related to the resolution of substantially all patent royalty matters accrued with respect to past-year vehicle sales. in the year ended december 31, 2022, favorable other was due to the weakening of the korean won and other currencies against the u.s. dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the brazilian real and other currencies against the u.s. dollar.

in the year ended december 31, 2022, income tax expense decreased primarily due to cruise valuation allowance adjustments, lower effective tax rate as a result of cruise reconsolidation and lower pre-tax income. the decrease was partially offset by absence of tax benefit related to a deduction for an investment in a subsidiary, which occurred in the year ended december 31, 2021.
for the year ended december 31, 2022 our etr-adjusted was 20.2%. we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 16% and 18% for the year ending december 31, 2023.

n.m. = not meaningful gm financial revenue in the year ended december 31, 2022, total revenue decreased primarily due to decreased leased vehicle income of $1.2 billion primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of the leased vehicles portfolio; partially offset general motors company and subsidiaries by increased finance charge income of $0.4 billion primarily due to growth in the retail finance receivables portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in the effective yield due to increased lending to borrowers with prime credit; and an increase in the effective yield on commercial finance receivables as a result of higher benchmark rates, as well as an increase in the size of the portfolio.
gm financial ebt-adjusted in the year ended december 31, 2022, ebt-adjusted decreased primarily due to: (1) decreased leased vehicle income net of leased vehicle expenses of $0.7 billion primarily due to decreased depreciation on leased vehicles resulting from increased residual value estimates and a decrease in the size of the portfolio, decreased lease vehicle income primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of the leased vehicles portfolio, and decreased lease termination gains; (2) increased provision for loan losses of $0.4 billion primarily due to increased loan origination volume in 2022, and the reduction in reserve levels recorded in 2021 as a result of actual credit performance that was better than forecast and favorable expectations for future charge-offs and recoveries, as well as an economic forecast weighted more heavily to a weaker outlook as of december 31, 2022; and (3) increased interest expense of $0.3 billion primarily due to an increased effective rate of interest on our debt; partially offset by (4) increased finance charge income of $0.4 billion primarily due to growth in the retail finance receivables portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in the effective yield due to increased lending to borrowers with prime credit; and an increase in the effective yield on commercial finance receivables as a result of higher benchmark rates, as well as an increase in the size of the portfolio.
liquidity and capital resources we believe our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities and other liquidity actions currently available to us are sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements. we also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. we have substantial cash requirements going forward, which we plan to fund through our total available liquidity, cash flows from operating activities and additional liquidity measures, if determined to be necessary.
our known current material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital spending and our investments in our battery cell manufacturing joint ventures of approximately $11.0 billion to $13.0 billion per year through 2025; (2) payments for engineering and product development activities; (3) payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls and any other recall-related contingencies; (4) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including discretionary and mandatory contributions to our pension plans; (5) payments associated with the liquidity program for holders of equity-based incentive awards issued to employees of cruise; (6) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our board of directors; and (7) payments to purchase shares of our common stock authorized by our board of directors. refer to note 7, note 13 and note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional funding requirements for our operating leases, debt and pension plans. our material future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are focused on the three objectives of our capital allocation program: (1) grow our business at an average target roic-adjusted rate of 20% or greater; (2) maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet, including a target average automotive cash balance of $18.0 billion; and (3) after the first two objectives are met, return available cash to shareholders. our senior management evaluates our capital allocation program on an ongoing basis and recommends any modifications to the program to our board of directors not less than once annually.
we continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. these actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations, as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions and investments with joint venture partners, as well as strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business. to support our transition to evs, we anticipate making investments in suppliers or providing funding towards the execution of strategic, multi-year supply agreements to secure critical materials. in addition, we have entered, and plan to continue to enter, into offtake agreements that generally obligate us to purchase defined quantities of output. these arrangements could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory.
our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the "forward-looking statements" section of this md&a and part i, item 1a. risk factors, some of which are outside of our control.
in august 2022, our board of directors increased the capacity under our previously announced common stock repurchase program to $5.0 billion from the $3.3 billion that remained under the program as of june 30, 2022. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we completed $2.5 billion of repurchases under the program and retired approximately 64 million shares of our common stock.
general motors company and subsidiaries in september 2022, we reinstated a quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share of our common stock. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we paid dividends of $0.3 billion to holders of our common stock.
in november 2022, ultium cells llc, a wholly owned subsidiary of ultium cells holding llc, entered into a loan agreement with the u.s. department of energy (doe) through the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing program, pursuant to which ultium cells llc may borrow up to $2.5 billion. the proceeds of the loans will be used to finance the construction of new battery cell manufacturing facilities in the u.s. under the terms of the loan agreement, the doe will not have recourse on the principal and interest of the loan against general motors company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
in december 2022, we early redeemed our $1.0 billion 5.40% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date of october 2023 and recorded an insignificant loss. additionally, during 2022, we paid, prior to maturity, $0.5 billion of unsecured term loans in gmi.
in january 2023, we gave notice to early redeem our $1.5 billion 4.875% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date of october 2023. the settlement of the early redemption of these senior unsecured notes is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2023 and is expected to have an immaterial impact on our 2023 results.
cash flows that occur amongst our automotive, cruise and gm financial operations are eliminated when we consolidate our cash flows. such eliminations include, among other things, collections by automotive on wholesale accounts receivables financed by dealers through gm financial, payments between automotive and gm financial for accounts receivables transferred by automotive to gm financial, loans to automotive and cruise from gm financial, dividends issued by gm financial to automotive, tax payments by gm financial to automotive and automotive cash injections in cruise. the presentation of automotive liquidity, cruise liquidity and gm financial liquidity presented below includes the impact of cash transactions amongst the sectors that are ultimately eliminated in consolidation.
automotive liquidity total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and funds available under credit facilities. the amount of available liquidity is subject to seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.
we manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas subsidiaries. over 90% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within north america and at our regional treasury centers at december 31, 2022. we have used, and will continue to use, other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.
our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in u.s. dollars and include investments in u.s. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed securities. our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. the majority of our current investments in debt securities are with a/a2 or better rated issuers.
we use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. our automotive borrowing capacity under credit facilities totaled $15.5 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021, which consisted primarily of two credit facilities. total automotive borrowing capacity under our credit facilities does not include our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allocated for exclusive use of gm financial. we did not have any borrowings against our primary facilities, but had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021.
in april 2022, we renewed our 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility allocated for the exclusive use of gm financial, which now matures on april 4, 2023. if available capacity permits, gm financial continues to have access to our automotive credit facilities. gm financial did not have borrowings outstanding against any of these facilities at december 31, 2022 and 2021. we had intercompany loans from gm financial of $0.2 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate. we did not have intercompany loans to gm financial at december 31, 2022 and 2021. refer to note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
in august 2022, we issued $2.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes under our new sustainable finance framework with a weighted average interest rate of 5.51% and maturity dates in 2029 and 2032. we intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from these senior unsecured notes to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, new or existing green projects, assets or activities undertaken or owned by the company that meet one or more eligibility criteria outlined in our sustainable finance framework.
general motors company and subsidiaries several of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. we have reviewed our covenants in effect as of december 31, 2022 and determined we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future.
in march 2022, under the share purchase agreement, we acquired softbank's equity ownership stake in cruise for $2.1 billion and, separately, we made an additional $1.35 billion investment in cruise in place of softbank. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we made additional investments in cruise of $1.1 billion.
in september 2022, we exercised our 39.7 million warrants in stellantis. upon exercise, the warrants converted into 69.1 million common shares of stellantis, which we immediately sold back to stellantis. total net pre-tax proceeds, including dividends received, in connection with this transaction were approximately $1.1 billion.
gm financial's board of directors declared and paid dividends of $1.7 billion, $3.5 billion, and $0.8 billion on its common stock in 2022, 2021, and 2020. future dividends from gm financial will depend on several factors including business and economic conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio.

in the year ended december 31, 2022, gm financial's available liquidity increased primarily due to increased available borrowing capacity on unpledged eligible assets, resulting from the issuance of securitization transactions and unsecured debt. gm financial structures liquidity to support at least six months of gm financial's expected net cash flows, including new originations, without access to new debt financing transactions or other capital markets activity.
gm financial has access to $15.5 billion of our revolving credit facilities with exclusive access to the 364-day, $2.0 billion facility. refer to the "automotive liquidity" section of this md&a for additional details. we have a support agreement with gm financial which, among other things, establishes commitments of funding from us to gm financial. this agreement also provides that we will continue to own all of gm financial's outstanding voting shares so long as any unsecured debt securities remain outstanding at gm financial. in addition, we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure gm financial remains a subsidiary borrower under our corporate revolving credit facilities.
credit facilities in the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, gm financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities, which may be secured or unsecured, and gm financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy. at december 31, 2022, secured, committed unsecured and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities totaled $26.2 billion, $0.5 billion and $1.4 billion with advances outstanding of $3.9 billion, an insignificant amount and $1.4 billion.

in the year ended december 31, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to: (1) a decrease in leased vehicle income of $1.2 billion; and (2) a net increase in cash used in counterparty derivative collateral posting activities of $0.9 billion.
in the year ended december 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to: (1) an increase in purchases and originations of finance receivables of $6.1 billion; (2) a decrease in collections and recoveries on finance receivables of $0.7 billion; and (3) a decrease in the proceeds from termination of leased vehicles of $0.2 billion; partially offset by (4) a decrease in purchases of leased vehicles of $2.7 billion.
in the year ended december 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to: (1) a decrease in debt repayments of $8.8 billion; and (2) a decrease in dividend payments of $1.8 billion; partially offset by (3) a decrease in borrowings of $4.0 billion.
general motors company and subsidiaries libor transition as discussed in part i, item 1a. risk factors, banks will no longer be persuaded or compelled to submit rates for the calculation of libor. gm financial established a libor transition initiative in 2019 to evaluate the potential impacts of the transition, and continues to implement strategies to mitigate the risks associated with the libor discontinuation such as amending existing libor-based transactions where feasible. gm financial has only a limited amount of libor-based debt outstanding that is currently scheduled to mature after june 30, 2023 and if not amendable, would utilize the alternative reference rates committee fallback process where applicable. furthermore, gm financial has adhered to the international swaps and derivatives association's fallbacks protocol and is transitioning its existing libor-based derivative exposure in advance of the june 30, 2023 date when applicable libor will no longer be published. for any residual exposure after the end of 2022, gm financial expects to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions to transition such exposure.
critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. we believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.
product warranty and recall campaigns the estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. when little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models.
we accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.
the estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. these estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. these estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.
the estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. a 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.4 billion.
actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.
sales incentives the estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. a change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. a 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by an insignificant amount. subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in automotive net sales and revenue.
general motors company and subsidiaries gm financial allowance for loan losses  the gm financial retail finance receivables portfolio consists of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. the allowance for loan losses on retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a weighted average remaining life of approximately two years. gm financial forecasts net credit losses based on relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. gm financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not increase.
gm financial incorporates its outlook on forecast recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. each 5% relative decrease/increase in the forecast recovery rates would increase/decrease the allowance for loan losses by $0.1 billion.
at december 31, 2022, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $2.1 billion. if the forecast economic conditions were based entirely on the weakest scenario considered, the allowance for loan losses would increase by $74 million. actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by gm financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.
the gm financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. the allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that gm financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.
valuation of gm financial equipment on operating lease assets and residuals gm financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases. each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that gm financial owns and has leased to a customer. at lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. gm financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices.
during the term of a lease, gm financial periodically evaluates the estimated residual value and may adjust the value downward, which increases the prospective depreciation, or upward (limited to the contractual residual value), which decreases the prospective depreciation.
the customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. however, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, gm financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the proceeds gm financial receives on the disposition of the vehicle are lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception. realization of the residual values is dependent on gm financial's future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.
at december 31, 2022, the estimated residual value of gm financial's leased vehicles was $24.7 billion. depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in gm financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected residual value at the end of the lease term. if used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, gm financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. if an impairment exists, gm financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. alternatively, if used vehicle prices outperform gm financial's latest estimates, it may record gains on sales of off-lease vehicles and/or decreased depreciation expense.
general motors company and subsidiaries the following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at december 31, 2022, which could increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):
impact to depreciation expense
2023                      $181
2024                        52
2025                        13
2026 and thereafter                         1
total                      $247
changes to residual values are rarely simultaneous across all maturities and segments, and also may impact return rates. if a decrease in residual values is concentrated among specific asset groups, the decrease could result in an immediate impairment charge. gm financial reviewed the leased vehicle portfolio for indicators of impairment and determined that no impairment indicators were present at december 31, 2022 and 2021.
used vehicle prices decreased since the end of 2021 due to normalization of supply and demand; however, prices remain above pre-pandemic levels. in 2023, gm financial expects used vehicle prices to continue moderating through the year.
pension and opeb plans our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. our pension obligations include korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.
in december 2022, an investment policy study was completed for the u.s. pension plans. as a result of changes to our capital market assumptions, the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets increased from 5.4% at december 31, 2021 to 6.3% at december 31, 2022. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-u.s. plans is determined in a similar manner to the u.s. plans.
another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. we estimate the assumed discount rate for u.s. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. we apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.
the society of actuaries (soa) issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended december 31, 2022. we reviewed our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our u.s. pension and opeb plans obligations as of december 31, 2022.
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $3.3 billion and $3.7 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021. the year-over-year change is primarily due to an increase in discount rates partially offset by lower than expected asset returns.
the funded status of the u.s. pension plans improved in the year ended december 31, 2022 to $0.1 billion overfunded status from $0.3 billion underfunded status primarily due to: (1) the favorable effect of an increase in discount rates of $11.9 billion; and (2) changes in actuarial assumptions, demographic data updates and contributions of $0.3 billion; partially offset by (3) the unfavorable effect of negative actual returns on plan assets of $10.3 billion; and (4) service and interest costs of $1.5 billion.

valuation of deferred tax assets  the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions, governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of valuation allowances.

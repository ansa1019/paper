executive overview the fiscal year ended july 2, 2022 was a 52-week period, july 3, 2021 was a 53-week period, and june 27, 2020 was a 52-week period.
tapestry, inc. is a leading new york-based house of accessible luxury accessories and lifestyle brands. our global house of brands unites the magic of coach, kate spade new york and stuart weitzman. each of our brands are unique and independent, while sharing a commitment to innovation and authenticity defined by distinctive products and differentiated customer experiences across channels and geographies. we use our collective strengths to move our customers and empower our communities, to make the fashion industry more sustainable, and to build a company that's equitable, inclusive, and diverse. individually, our brands are iconic. together, we can stretch what's possible.
the company has three reportable segments:
•coach - includes global sales of coach products to customers through coach operated stores, including e-commerce sites and concession shop-in-shops, and sales to wholesale customers and through independent third party distributors.
•kate spade - includes global sales primarily of kate spade new york brand products to customers through kate spade operated stores, including e-commerce sites and concession shop-in-shops, sales to wholesale customers and through independent third party distributors.
•stuart weitzman - includes global sales of stuart weitzman brand products primarily through stuart weitzman operated stores, including e-commerce sites, sales to wholesale customers and through numerous independent third party distributors.
each of our brands is unique and independent, while sharing a commitment to innovation and authenticity defined by distinctive products and differentiated customer experiences across channels and geographies. our success does not depend solely on the performance of a single channel, geographic area or brand.
acceleration program starting in fiscal 2020, the company embarked on a strategic growth plan after undergoing a review of its business under the acceleration program, resulting in certain costs to date reflecting: (i) actions to streamline the company's organization; (ii) select store closures as the company optimizes its fleet (including store closure costs incurred as the company exits certain regions in which it currently operates); and (iii) professional fees and compensation costs incurred as a result of the development and execution of the company's comprehensive strategic initiatives aimed at increasing profitability. the guiding principle under the acceleration program is to better meet the needs of each of its brands' unique customers by:
•sharpening our focus on the consumer: operating with a clearly defined purpose and strategy for each brand and an unwavering focus on the consumer at the core of everything we do.
•leveraging data and leading with a digital-first mindset: building significant data and analytics capabilities to drive decision-making and increase efficiency; offering immersive customer experiences across our e-commerce and social channels to meet the needs of consumers who are increasingly utilizing digital platforms to engage with brands; rethinking the role of stores with an intent to optimize our fleet.
•transforming into a leaner and more responsive organization: moving with greater agility, simplifying internal processes and empowering teams to act quickly to meet the rapidly changing needs of the consumer.
throughout fiscal 2022, the company made meaningful progress under its acceleration program by sharpening the company's focus on the consumer, leveraging data to lead with a digital-first mindset and transforming into a leaner and more responsive organization:
•recruited approximately 7.7 million new customers across channels in north america, representing a 10% increase versus prior year, with growth in both stores and online.
•maintained a consumer-centric lens and fostered emotional connections with customers, resulting in higher average spend per customer, increased retention rates and the continued reactivation of lapsed customers across brands.
•delivered global average unit retail ("aur") gains at coach, kate spade, and stuart weitzman, reflecting brand heat and pricing power, the increasing traction of their product offerings, and select price increases, as well as continued benefits from structural changes to lessen promotional activity.
•advanced digital capabilities through significant investments in the channel, including in talent, to improve the customer experience and drive conversion; achieved $2 billion in digital revenue in the fiscal year, representing 30% of total sales.
•realized gross run-rate savings of approximately $300 million in fiscal 2022, which continues to fund investments in brand-building activities.
the company does not expect to incur further expenses related to the acceleration program in fiscal 2023. refer to note 5, "restructuring activities," and the "gaap to non-gaap reconciliation," herein, for further information.
recent developments covid-19 pandemic the disruptions related to covid-19 have materially adversely impacted our operations, cash flow, and liquidity. the virus has impacted all regions around the world, resulting in restrictions and shutdowns implemented by national, state, and local authorities. these requirements resulted in closures of our directly operated stores globally, as well as our wholesale and licensing partners, causing a significant reduction in sales starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. while the vast majority of the company's stores and locations of our wholesale and licensing partners have reopened, certain have experienced temporary re-closures or are operating under tighter restrictions in compliance with local government regulations. the company's performance in fiscal 2022 was adversely impacted as a result of infections due to variants of covid-19 in certain regions, most notably in greater china, which resulted in disruptions in business performance including a decline in demand in the region. while the trends in greater china started to improve at the end of fiscal 2022, the situation continues to be very volatile and infection rates and government restrictions may continue to persist.
furthermore, covid-19 has and may continue to cause disruptions in the company's supply chain within our third-party manufacturers and logistics providers. during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, certain of the company's third-party manufacturers, primarily located in vietnam, experienced ongoing and longer-than-expected government mandated restrictions, which resulted in a significant decrease in production capacity for these third-party manufacturers. in response, the company took deliberate actions such as shifting production to other countries, adjusting its merchandising strategies, where possible, and increasing the use of air freight to expedite delivery. based on these actions, and the improved production levels since the first quarter, the company has been able to meet anticipated levels of demand.
the company has been experiencing other global logistics challenges, such as delays as a result of port congestion, vessel availability, container shortages for imported products and rising freight costs. to mitigate delays, the company strategically used air freight with greater frequency than in the past, primarily in the second and third fiscal quarter of 2022. due to these logistical challenges, during fiscal 2022, the company recognized within cost of sales $178.5 million of incremental freight costs compared to fiscal 2021, in order to maintain product flow to meet consumer demand.
there is still uncertainty associated with the covid-19 pandemic, and challenges are expected to persist into fiscal 2023, including the possibility of other effects on the business. we will continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation pertaining to the covid-19 outbreak, including guidance from international and domestic authorities and adjust our operating plan as needed. refer to part i, item 1a. "risk factors" herein.
the company continues to take strategic actions in response to the current environment. the company remains committed to driving sg&a savings, including actions taken under the acceleration program. the company will continue to consider near-term exigencies and the long-term financial health of the business as clear steps are taken to mitigate the consequences of the covid-19 pandemic.
covid-19 related impairments there were no covid-19 related impairments recorded in fiscal 2022. during fiscal 2021, the company recorded $45.8 million of impairment charges related to lease right-of-use assets, which were primarily driven by the continued impacts of covid-19. refer to note 11, "fair value measurements" for further information. in addition, in fiscal 2021, the company recognized a reversal of raw material reserves of $8.1 million, which was established in fiscal 2020 as a result of the projected impact of covid-19.
crisis in ukraine in the second half of fiscal 2022, a humanitarian crisis unfolded in ukraine, which has created significant economic uncertainty in the region. the company does not have directly operated stores in russia or ukraine and has a minimal distributor and wholesale business which was less than 0.1% of the company's total net sales for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 the company paused all wholesale shipments to russia and ukraine. the company's total business in europe represented less than 5% of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 total net sales.
current trends and outlook the environment in which we operate is subject to a number of different factors driving global consumer spending. consumer preferences, macroeconomic conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and geopolitical events continue to impact overall levels of consumer travel and spending on discretionary items, with inconsistent patterns across channels and geographies.
the outbreak of a novel strain of covid-19 continues to impact a significant majority of the regions in which we operate, resulting in significant global business disruptions. the widespread impact of covid-19 resulted in temporary closures of directly operated stores globally, as well as at our wholesale and licensing partners starting in fiscal 2020. since then, certain directly operated stores and the stores of our wholesale and licensing partners have experienced temporary re-closures or are operating under tighter restrictions in compliance with local government regulation. the company's performance in fiscal 2022 was adversely impacted as a result of infections due to variants of covid-19 in certain regions, most notably in greater china, which resulted in disruptions in business performance including a decline in demand in the region. furthermore, as discussed in "recent developments", covid-19 has also resulted in ongoing supply chain challenges, such as logistic constraints, the closure of certain third-party manufacturers and increased freight costs.
we continue to monitor the latest developments regarding the pandemic and have made certain assumptions about the pandemic for purposes of our business and operating results, including assumptions regarding the duration, severity and global macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic. however, the full extent of the impact of covid-19 on our business and operating results will depend largely on future events outside of our control including the ultimate duration, severity and geographic resurgence of the virus and the success of actions to contain the virus, including variants of the novel strain, or treat its impact, among others.
several organizations that monitor the world's economy, including the international monetary fund, continue to forecast growth in the global economy. however, some of these organizations have recently revised the forecast downward since the third quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily to reflect a higher-than-anticipated slowdown in greater china, reflective of covid-19 outbreaks and lockdown, and further negative economic impacts due to the crisis in ukraine. inflation is expected to remain elevated for longer than in previous forecasts and concerns regarding an oncoming recession have increased in recent months.
certain markets around the world have been faced with labor shortages, which have not impacted the company's operations to date. if these trends continue or worsen, it could potentially affect the company's ability to attract and retain employees for its retail and fulfillment locations in the future.
furthermore, currency volatility, political instability and potential changes to trade agreements or duty rates may contribute to a worsening of the macroeconomic environment or adversely impact our business. since fiscal 2019, the u.s. and china have both imposed tariffs on the importation of certain product categories into the respective country, with limited progress in negotiations to reduce or remove the tariffs. additionally, the company has historically benefited from duty-free imports on certain products from certain countries pursuant to the u.s. generalized system of preferences ("gsp") program. the gsp program expired in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, resulting in additional duties that have negatively impacting gross profit.
over the past year there has been significant discussion with regards to tax legislation by both the biden administration and the organization for economic cooperation and development ("oecd"). on august 16, 2022, the inflation reduction act of 2022 was signed into law, with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 15% minimum tax on global adjusted financial statement income and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. the inflation reduction act of 2022 will become effective beginning in fiscal 2024. given its recent pronouncement, it is unclear at this time what, if any, impact the inflation reduction act of 2022 will have on the company's tax rate and financial results. we will continue to evaluate its impact as further information becomes available.
we will continue to monitor these trends and evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and cost management opportunities to mitigate the related impact on our results of operations, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our business and protecting the value of our brands.
furthermore, refer to part i, item 1 - "business" for additional discussion on our expected store openings and closures within each of our segments. for a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to part i, item 1a - "risk factors".

these non-gaap performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected. management and the company's board utilized these non-gaap measures to make decisions about the uses of company resources, analyze performance between periods, develop internal projections and measure management performance. the company's internal management reporting excluded these items. in addition, the human resources committee of the company's board uses these non-gaap measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals.
the company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in u.s. dollars in accordance with gaap. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the amounts reported by the company in u.s. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and profit. accordingly, certain material increases and decreases in operating results for the company and its segments have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects. these effects occur from translating foreign-denominated amounts into u.s. dollars and comparing to the same period in the prior fiscal year. constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. the company calculates constant currency revenue results by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year period's currency conversion rate.
we believe these non-gaap measures are useful to investors and others in evaluating the company's ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the company's historical performance. additionally, we believe presenting certain increases and decreases in constant currency provides a framework for assessing the performance of the company's business outside the united states and helps investors and analysts understand the effect of significant year-over-year currency fluctuations. we believe excluding these items assists investors and others in developing expectations of future performance.
by providing the non-gaap measures, as a supplement to gaap information, we believe we are enhancing investors' understanding of our business and our results of operations. the non-gaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, gaap financial measures. further, these non-gaap measures may be unique to the company, as they may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies.
for a detailed discussion on these non-gaap measures, see item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations".

the company's cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1.22 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of $581.4 million in fiscal 2021, as discussed below.
net cash provided by (used in) operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased $470.5 million primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $597.1 million, partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt of $53.7 million, the impact of non-cash charges of $50.8 million and higher net income of $22.1 million.
the $597.1 million change in our operating asset and liability balances was primarily driven by:
•inventories were a use of cash of $311.7 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to a source of cash of $32.2 million in fiscal 2021, primarily driven by higher receipts, increased in-transit levels due to longer lead times and increased inbound freight costs compared to prior year.
•accounts payable were a source of cash of $86.4 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to a source of cash of $307.3 million in fiscal 2021, primarily due to the extension of payment terms with certain vendors in fiscal 2021 and higher inventory in-transit in fiscal 2022.
•other assets were a use of cash of $20.2 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to a use of cash of $223.1 million in fiscal 2021, primarily attributed to income tax receivables including the nol carryback claim under the cares act filed in fiscal 2021 and the timing of payments and other refunds in the u.s.
•accrued liabilities were a use of cash of $16.1 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to a source of cash of $140.3 million in fiscal 2021, primarily attributed to the annual incentive plan payment as the company did not pay out during fiscal 2021 (for performance during fiscal year 2020) offset by increased distribution costs driven by higher sales and inbound freight.
net cash provided by (used in) investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $253.6 million in fiscal 2022 compared to a use of cash of $91.0 million in fiscal 2021, resulting in a $162.6 million increase in net cash used in investing activities.
the $253.6 million use of cash in fiscal 2022 is primarily due to purchases of investments of $540.4 million and capital expenditures of $93.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of investments of $380.7 million.
the $91.0 million use of cash in fiscal 2021 is primarily due to capital expenditures of $116.0 million. this use of cash was partially offset by net cash proceeds from the sales of building of $23.9 million.
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $1.78 billion in fiscal 2022 as compared to a use of cash of $666.0 million in fiscal 2021, resulting in a $1.11 billion increase in net cash used in financing activities.
the $1.78 billion use of cash in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to repurchase of common stock of $1.60 billion, repayment of debt of $900.0 million, payment of dividends of $264.4 million and the payment of debt extinguishment costs of $50.7 million, partially offset by proceeds from debt, net of discount of $998.5 million.
the $666.0 million use of cash in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to repayments on the revolving credit facility of $700.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from share based awards of $61.2 million.

working capital and capital expenditures as of july 2, 2022, in addition to our cash flows from operations, our sources of liquidity and capital resources were comprised of the following:

cash and cash equivalents(1)                    $789.8                                         $-                          $789.8

(1)    as of july 2, 2022, approximately 34.7% of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held outside the united states. we have analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements, and the potential tax liabilities associated with repatriation, and have determined that we will likely repatriate some portion of available foreign cash in the foreseeable future. the company has recorded deferred taxes on certain earnings of non-us subsidiaries that are deemed likely to be repatriated. see note 15, "income taxes" for more information.
(2)    on may 11, 2022, the company financed and replaced the $900.0 million revolving credit facility by entering into a new credit facility that (i) includes an increased revolving credit facility (the "$1.25 billion revolving credit facility") from $900.0 million to $1.25 billion, (ii) includes an unsecured $500.0 million term loan (the "term loan") and (iii) redefines certain terms within the replaced revolving credit facility. both the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility and term loan (collectively, the "credit facilities") will mature on may 11, 2027. the company and its subsidiaries must comply on a quarterly basis with a maximum 4.0 to 1.0 ratio of (a) consolidated debt minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $300 million to (b) consolidated ebitdar.
borrowings under the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the company's option, (i) for borrowings in u.s. dollars, either (a) an alternate base rate or (b) a term secured overnight financing rate, (ii) for borrowings in euros, the euro interbank offered rate, (iii) for borrowings in pounds sterling, the sterling overnight index average reference rate and (iv) for borrowings in japanese yen, the tokyo interbank offer rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. the applicable margin will be adjusted by reference to a grid (the "pricing grid") based on the ratio of (a) consolidated debt to (b) consolidated ebitdar (the "gross leverage ratio"). additionally, the company will pay facility fees, calculated at a rate per annum determined in accordance with the pricing grid, on the full amount of the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, payable quarterly in arrears, and certain fees with respect to letters of credit that are issued. the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility may be used to finance the working capital needs, capital expenditures, permitted investments, share purchases, dividends and other general corporate purposes of the company and its subsidiaries (which may include commercial paper backup). there were no outstanding borrowings on the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility as of july 2, 2022.
the term loan includes a two-month delayed draw period from the closing date. on june 14, 2022 the company drew down on the term loan to satisfy the company's remaining obligations under the 3.000% senior unsecured notes due 2022 and for general corporate purposes. the term loan amortizes in an amount equal to 5.00% per annum, with payments made quarterly. as of july 2, 2022, $31.2 million of the term loan is included in current debt on the consolidated balance sheet. borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the company's option, either (i) an alternate base rate or (ii) a term secured overnight financing rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. the applicable margin will be adjusted by reference to a pricing grid based on the gross leverage ratio. additionally, the company will pay a ticking fee on the undrawn amount of the term loan. refer to note 12, "debt," for further information on our existing debt instruments.
(3)    in december 2021, the company issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.050% senior unsecured notes due march 15, 2032 at 99.705% of par (the "2032 senior notes") and completed cash tender offers for $203.4 million and
$296.6 million of the outstanding aggregate principal amount under its 2027 senior notes and 2025 senior notes, respectively. in june 2017, the company issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 senior notes, and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.000% senior unsecured notes due july 15, 2022 at 99.505% of par (the "2022 senior notes"). the 2022 senior notes were fully redeemed as of july 2, 2022. in march 2015, the company issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 senior notes. furthermore, the indentures for the 2032 senior notes, 2027 senior notes, and 2025 senior notes contain certain covenants limiting the company's ability to: (i) create certain liens, (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and (iii) merge, or consolidate or transfer, sell or lease all or substantially all of the company's assets. as of july 2, 2022, no known events of default have occurred. refer to note 12, "debt," for further information on our existing debt instruments.
we believe that our revolving credit facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution. as of july 2, 2022, there were 14 financial institutions participating in the revolving credit facility and term loans, with no one participant maintaining a combined maximum commitment percentage in excess of 14%. we have no reason to believe at this time that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the facility in the event we elect to draw funds in the foreseeable future.
we have the ability to draw on our credit facilities or access other sources of financing options available to us in the credit and capital markets for, among other things, acquisition or integration-related costs, our restructuring initiatives, settlement of a material contingency, or a material adverse business or macroeconomic development, as well as for other general corporate business purposes.
management believes that cash flows from operations, access to the credit and capital markets and our credit lines, on-hand cash and cash equivalents and our investments will provide adequate funds to support our operating, capital, and debt service requirements for fiscal 2023 and beyond. there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. our ability to fund working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and scheduled debt payments, as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under our debt agreements, depends on future operating performance and cash flow. this future operating performance and cash flow are subject to prevailing economic conditions, which is uncertain as a result of covid-19, and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond the company's control.
to improve our working capital efficiency, starting in fiscal 2021 we made available to certain suppliers a voluntary supply chain finance ("scf") program that enables our suppliers to sell their receivables from the company to a global financial institution on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating. we do not have the ability to refinance or modify payment terms to the global financial institution through the scf program. no guarantees are provided by the company or any of our subsidiaries under the scf program.
total capital expenditures and cloud computing implementation costs were $161.6 million in fiscal 2022 as the company continues to prioritize investing in digital capabilities. certain cloud computing implementation costs are recognized within prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
seasonality the company's results are typically affected by seasonal trends. during the first fiscal quarter, we typically build inventory for the winter and holiday season. in the second fiscal quarter, working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income, especially during the holiday season. in fiscal 2022, due to the increased in-transit times, the company started to build inventory in the fourth fiscal quarter for the fiscal 2023 winter and holiday season.
fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including macroeconomic events, such as covid-19, or adverse weather conditions.
stock repurchase plan on november 11, 2021, the company announced the board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.00 billion of its outstanding common stock (the "2021 share repurchase program"). on may 12, 2022, the company announced the board of directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to $1.50 billion of its common stock (the "2022 share repurchase program"). pursuant to this program, purchases of the company's common stock will be made subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices, through open market purchases. repurchased shares of common stock will become authorized but unissued shares. these shares may be issued in the future for general corporate and other purposes. in addition, the company may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time. as of july 2, 2022, the company had $1.50 billion of additional shares available to be repurchased as authorized under the 2021 share repurchase program and 2022 share repurchase program. refer to part ii, item 5. "market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities," for further information. the company intends to repurchase approximately $700.0 million worth of stock in fiscal 2023, all of which is remaining under its current authorization.
contractual and other obligations firm commitments as of july 2, 2022, the company's contractual obligations are as follows:
total                         fiscal                          fiscal                        fiscal                     fiscal 2028

(1)    mandatory transition tax payments represent our tax obligation incurred in connection with the deemed repatriation of previously deferred foreign earnings pursuant to the tax legislation. refer to note 15, "income taxes," for further information. interest on outstanding debt includes fixed interest expenses for unsecured notes and variable interest expenses for the term loan. the estimated interest expenses associated with our term loan is based on the current interest rate as of july 2, 2022. refer to note 12, "debt," for further information.
we expect to fund these firm commitments with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and, if necessary, through availability under our credit facilities or other accessible sources of financing. excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $101.1 million as of july 2, 2022, as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. besides the firm commitments noted above, the above table excludes other amounts included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at july 2, 2022 as these items will be paid within one year and certain long-term liabilities not requiring cash payments.
off-balance sheet arrangements in addition to the commitments included in the table above, we have outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees of $37.8 million as of july 2, 2022, primarily serving to collateralize our obligation to third parties for duty, leases, insurance claims and materials used in product manufacturing. these letters of credit expire at various dates through calendar 2028.
we do not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements. refer to note 13, "commitments and contingencies," for further information.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the company's financial statements. actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. the development and selection of the company's critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board.
the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements. for more information on the company's accounting policies, please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the company satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of promised products or services to its customers, which may be at a point of time or over time. control is transferred when the customer obtains the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the products or services. the amount of revenue recognized is the amount of consideration to which the company expects to be entitled, including estimation of sale terms that may create variability in the consideration. revenue subject to variability is constrained to an amount which will not result in a significant reversal in future periods when the contingency that creates variability is resolved.
retail store and concession shop-in-shop revenues are recognized at the point-of-sale, when the customer obtains physical possession of the products. digital revenue from sales of products ordered through the company's e-commerce sites is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment by its customers and includes shipping and handling charges paid by customers. retail and digital revenues are recorded net of estimated returns, which are estimated by developing an expected value based on historical experience. payment is due at the point of sale.
the company recognizes revenue within the wholesale channel at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers, which is generally at the point of shipment of products but may occur upon receipt of the shipment by the customer in certain cases. wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, cooperative advertising allowances and other consideration provided to the customer. the company's historical estimates of these variable amounts have not differed materially from actual results.
the company recognizes licensing revenue over time during the contract period in which licensees are granted access to the company's trademarks. these arrangements require licensees to pay a sales-based royalty and may include a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount. revenue for contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amounts is recognized ratably over the license year and any excess sales-based royalties are recognized as earned once the minimum royalty threshold is achieved.
at july 2, 2022, a 10% change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, markdowns and returns would not have resulted in a material change in the company's reserves and net sales.
inventories the company holds inventory that is sold through retail and wholesale distribution channels, including e-commerce sites. substantially all of the company's inventories are comprised of finished goods, and are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value. inventory costs include material, conversion costs, freight and duties and are primarily determined on a weighted-average cost basis. the company reserves for inventory, including slow-moving and aged inventory, based on current product demand, expected future demand and historical experience. a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes, buying patterns or increased competition could impact the company's evaluation of its inventory and additional reserves might be required. estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. at july 2, 2022, a 10% change in the inventory reserve, would not have resulted in material change in inventory and cost of sales.
goodwill and other intangible assets upon acquisition, the company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets, which primarily consists of brands, customer relationships, right-of-use assets and order backlog. goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, including brand intangible assets, are not amortized, but are assessed for impairment at least annually. finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets as noted above, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. estimates of fair value for finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and the multi-period excess earnings method, respectively, with consideration of market comparisons as appropriate. this approach uses significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
the company generally performs its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analysis using a quantitative approach. the quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies the existence of potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not to be impaired. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. the impairment charge recognized is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible asset is based on management's assessment, considering independent third-party appraisals when necessary. furthermore, this determination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which may include projected future cash flows, discount rates, growth rates, and determination of appropriate market comparables and recent transactions. these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge.
the company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill as well as brand intangibles at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021. during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, profitability trends continued to decline from those that were expected for the stuart weitzman brand. the reduction in both cash from operations and future expected cash flows were exacerbated by the covid-19 pandemic, which resulted in a decline in sales driven by full and partial closures of a significant portion of our stores globally. as a result of these macroeconomic conditions, the company concluded that a triggering event had occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, resulting in the need to perform a quantitative interim impairment assessment over the company's stuart weitzman reporting unit and indefinite-lived brand intangible assets. the assessment concluded that the fair values of the stuart weitzman reporting unit and indefinite-lived brand intangible asset as of the third quarter of fiscal 2020 did not exceed their respective carrying values. accordingly, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $210.7 million related to the stuart weitzman reporting unit, resulting in a full impairment. during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the company also recorded an impairment charge of $267.0 million related to the stuart weitzman indefinite-lived brand, resulting in a full impairment. in considering the excess of the fair value over its carrying value for all coach and kate spade reporting unit and indefinite-lived brand intangibles, management did not perform an interim assessment for these reporting units in fiscal 2020. further, the company determined there was no impairment during the fiscal 2020 annual impairment assessment.
based on the annual assessment in fiscal 2022, the fair values of our coach brand reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. the fair values of the kate spade brand reporting unit and indefinite-lived brand as of the fiscal 2022 testing date exceeded their carrying values by approximately 50% and 90%, respectively. several factors could impact the kate spade brand's ability to achieve expected future cash flows, including the optimization of the store fleet productivity, the success of international expansion strategies, the impact of promotional activity, continued economic volatility and potential operational challenges related to the macroeconomic factors, the reception of new collections in all channels, and other initiatives aimed at increasing profitability of the business. given the relatively small excess of fair value over carrying value as noted above, if profitability trends decline during fiscal 2023 from those that are expected, it is possible that an interim test, or our annual impairment test, could result in an impairment of these assets.
valuation of long-lived assets long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. in evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, the company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the related asset group and its eventual disposition. to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions.
in determining future cash flows, the company takes various factors into account, including the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, in-store capital investments, promotional cadence, the level of advertising and changes in merchandising strategy. since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations.
share-based compensation the company recognizes the cost of equity awards to employees and the non-employee directors based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. the grant-date fair values of share unit awards are based on the fair value of the company's common stock on the date of grant. the grant-date fair value of stock option awards is determined using the black-scholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions, including the expected term of the option, expected volatility and dividend yield. the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience. expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company's stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on the company's stock. dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company's stock price. changes in the assumptions used to determine the black-scholes value could result in significant changes in the black-scholes value.
for stock options and share unit awards, the company recognizes share-based compensation net of estimated forfeitures and revises the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates. the company estimates the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior.
the company grants performance-based share awards to key executives, the vesting of which is subject to the executive's continuing employment and the company's or individual's achievement of certain performance goals. on a quarterly basis, the company assesses actual performance versus the predetermined performance goals, and adjusts the share-based compensation expense to reflect the relative performance achievement. actual distributed shares are calculated upon conclusion of the service and performance periods, and include dividend equivalent shares. if the performance-based award incorporates a market condition, the grant-date fair value of such award is determined using a pricing model, such as a monte carlo simulation.
a hypothetical 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense would not have a material impact to our fiscal 2022 net income.
income taxes the company's effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates. the company classifies interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. in making such determination, the company considers all available evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent and expected future results of operation. the company reduces deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of deferred tax assets is not expected to be realized. the company is not permanently reinvested with respect to earnings of a limited number of foreign entities and has recorded the tax consequences of remitting earnings from these entities. the company is permanently reinvested with respect to all other earnings.
the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. although the company believes that the estimates and assumptions used are reasonable and legally supportable, the final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. tax authorities periodically audit the company's income tax returns and the tax authorities may take a contrary position that could result in a significant impact on the company's results of operations. significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate, in evaluating tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets.

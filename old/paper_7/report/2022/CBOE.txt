business segments the company previously operated five reportable business segments prior to the quarter ended june 30, 2022. as a result of the cboe digital acquisition during the quarter ended june 30, 2022, the company operates six reportable segments: options, north american equities, europe and asia pacific, futures, global fx, and digital, which is reflective of how the company's chief operating decision-maker reviews and operates the business, as discussed in note 1 ("nature of operations"). segment performance is primarily evaluated based on operating income (loss). the company's chief operating decision-maker does not use segment-level assets or income and expenses below operating income (loss) as key performance metrics; therefore, such information is not presented below. the company has aggregated all of its corporate costs, as well as other business ventures, within the corporate items and eliminations totals based on the decision that those activities should not be used to evaluate the operating performance of the segments; however, operating expenses that relate to activities of a specific segment have been allocated to that segment.
options. the options segment includes options on market indices ("index options"), as well as on the stocks of individual corporations ("equity options"), and options on etps, such as exchange-traded funds ("etfs") and exchange-traded notes ("etns"), which are "multi-listed" options and listed on a non-exclusive basis. these options are eligible to trade, as applicable, on cboe options, c2, bzx, edgx, and/or other u.s. national security exchanges. cboe options is the company's primary options market and offers trading in listed options through a single system that integrates electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading on the cboe options trading floor in chicago. c2 options, bzx options, and edgx options are all-electronic options exchanges, and typically operate with different market models and fee structures than cboe options. the options segment also includes applicable market data fees generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary options market data, index licensing, and access and capacity services.
north american equities. the north american equities segment includes listed u.s. equities and etp transaction services that occur on fully electronic exchanges owned and operated by bzx, byx, edgx, and edga, equities transactions that occur on the bids trading platform, and canadian equities and other transaction services that occur on or through the matchnow ats, and neo, as of the june 1, 2022 acquisition. the north american equities segment also includes listing services on neo exchange, etp listings on bzx, the cboe global markets, inc. common stock listing, applicable market data fees generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary equities market data, routing services, and access and capacity services.
europe and asia pacific. the europe and asia pacific segment includes the pan-european listed equities and derivatives transaction services, etps, exchange-traded commodities, and international depository receipts that are hosted on mtfs operated by cboe europe equities (cboe europe and cboe nl equities exchanges) and cboe europe derivatives ("cedx"). it also includes the etp listings business on rms and clearing activities of cboe clear europe, as well as the equities transaction services of cboe australia and cboe japan, operators of trading venues in australia and japan, respectively. this segment was previously referred to as the european equities segment but was updated to the europe segment in the first quarter of 2021 as a result of the launch of cboe europe derivatives, a pan-european derivatives platform in september 2021. the segment was subsequently updated to europe and asia pacific to reflect the acquisition of chi-x in july 2021. cboe europe operates lit and dark books, a periodic auctions book, and cboe bids
65
europe, a large-in-scale ("lis") trading negotiation facility for uk symbols. cboe nl, launched in october 2019 and based in amsterdam, operates similar business functionality to that offered by cboe europe, and provides for trading only in european economic area ("eea") symbols. the new cboe europe derivatives venue offers futures and options based on cboe europe equity indices. this segment also includes cboe europe, cboe nl, cedx, cboe australia, and cboe japan revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services.
futures. the futures segment includes transaction services provided by cfe, a fully electronic futures exchange, which includes offerings for trading of vix futures and other futures products, the licensing of proprietary market data, as well as access and capacity services.
global fx. the global fx segment includes institutional fx trading services that occur on the cboe fx fully electronic trading platform, non-deliverable forward fx transactions ("ndfs") offered for execution on cboe sef and cboe swiss, transaction services that occur on the electronic trading system for u.s government securities executed by cboe fixed income, as well as revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services.
digital. the digital segment includes cboe digital, an operator of a u.s. based digital asset spot market and a regulated futures exchange, and cboe clear digital, a regulated clearinghouse, as well as revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services.
general factors affecting results of operations in broad terms, our business performance is impacted by a number of drivers, including macroeconomic events affecting the risk and return of financial assets, investor sentiment, the regulatory environment for capital markets, geopolitical events, tax policies, central bank policies and changing technology, particularly in the financial services industry. we believe our future revenues and net income will continue to be influenced by a number of domestic and international economic trends, including:
●   trading volumes on our proprietary products such as vix options and futures and spx options;

●   trading volumes in listed equity securities, options, futures, and etps in north america, europe, and asia pacific, clearing volumes in listed equity securities and etps in europe, volumes in listed equity options, volumes in digital assets, and volumes in institutional fx trading;

●   the demand for and pricing structure of the u.s. tape plan market data distributed by the sips, which determines the pool size of the industry market data fees we receive based on our market share;

●   consolidation and expansion of our customers and competitors in the industry;

●   the demand for information about, or access to, our markets and products, which is dependent on the products we trade, our importance as a liquidity center, quality and integrity of our proprietary indices, and the quality and pricing of our data and access and capacity services;

●   continuing pressure in transaction fee pricing due to intense competition in the north american, european, and asia pacific markets;

●   significant fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates or weakened value of currencies; and

●   regulatory changes and obligations relating to market structure, digital assets and increased capital requirements, and those which affect certain types of instruments, transactions, products, pricing structures, capital market participants or reporting or compliance requirements.

a number of significant structural, political and monetary issues, global conflicts and global pandemics continue to confront the global economy, and instability could continue, resulting in an increased or subdued level of inflation, market volatility, supply chain constraints, changes in trading volumes and greater uncertainty. inflationary increases in our expenses, such as compensation inflation, and increased costs related to cat may have an adverse effect on our financial results.
components of revenues beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the company updated the financial statement captions within its consolidated statements of income to better reflect the company's diversified products, expansive geographical reach, and overall business strategy. the changes do not have a financial impact on the company's reported revenue, revenues less cost of revenues, reported net income, or cash flows from operations.
66
the components of revenues which include the above changes are described below:
cash and spot markets revenue aggregated into cash and spot markets includes associated transaction and clearing fees, the portion of market data fees relating to associated u.s. tape plan market data fees, associated regulatory fees, and associated other revenue from the company's north american equities, europe and asia pacific, global fx, and digital segments.
data and access solutions revenue aggregated into data and access solutions includes access and capacity fees, proprietary market data fees, and associated other revenue across the company's six segments.
derivatives markets includes associated transaction and clearing fees, the portion of market data fees relating to associated u.s. tape plan market data fees, associated regulatory fees, and associated other fees from the company's options, futures, europe and asia pacific, and digital segments.
components of cost of revenues liquidity payments liquidity payments are directly correlated to the volume of securities traded on our markets. as stated above, we record the liquidity rebates paid to market participants providing liquidity, in the case of c2, bzx, edgx, and cboe europe equities and derivatives, and cboe digital, as cost of revenue. byx and edga offer a pricing model where we rebate liquidity takers for executing against an order resting on our book, which is also recorded as a cost of revenues.
routing and clearing various rules require that u.s. options and equities trade executions occur at the nbbo displayed by any exchange. linkage order routing consists of the cost incurred to provide a service whereby cboe equities and options exchanges deliver orders to other execution venues when there is a potential for obtaining a better execution price or when instructed to directly route an order to another venue by the order provider. the service affords exchange order flow providers an opportunity to obtain the best available execution price and may also result in cost benefits to those clients. such an offering improves our competitive position and provides an opportunity to attract orders which would otherwise bypass our exchanges. we utilize third-party brokers or our broker-dealer, cboe trading, to facilitate such delivery. also included within routing and clearing are the order management system and execution management system ("oms" and "ems", respectively) fees incurred for u.s. equities off-exchange order execution, as well as settlement costs incurred for the settlement process executed by cboe clear europe and cboe clear digital.
section 31 fees exchanges under the authority of the sec (cboe options, c2, bzx, byx, edgx, and edga as well as cfe to the extent that cfe offers trading in security futures products) are assessed fees pursuant to the exchange act designed to recover the costs to the u.s. government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. we treat these fees as a pass-through charge to customers executing eligible listed equities and listed equity options trades. accordingly, we recognize the amount that we are charged under section 31 as a cost of revenues and the corresponding amount that we charge our customers as regulatory transaction fees revenue. since the regulatory transaction fees recorded in revenues are equal to the section 31 fees recorded in cost of revenues, there is no impact on our operating income. cboe trading, cboe europe, cboe nl, bids, matchnow, cboe fx, cboe australia, cboe japan, cboe digital, and neo are not u.s. national securities exchanges, and accordingly are not charged section 31 fees.
royalty fees and other cost of revenues royalty fees primarily consist of license fees paid by us for the use of underlying indices in our proprietary products usually based on contracts traded. the company has licenses with the owners of the s&p 500 index, s&p 100 index and certain other s&p indices, ftse russell indices, the djia, msci, and certain other index products. this category also
67
includes fees related to the dissemination of market data related to s&p indices and other products through cboe streaming market indices ("csmi").
other cost of revenues primarily consists of interest expense from clearing operations, electronic access permit fees and other miscellaneous costs associated with other revenue.
components of operating expenses compensation and benefits compensation and benefits represent our largest expense category and tend to be driven by our staffing requirements, financial performance, and the general dynamics of the employment market. stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to equity awards. stock-based compensation can vary depending on the quantity and fair value of the award on the date of grant and the related service period.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets purchased, the amortization of purchased and internally developed software, and the amortization of intangible assets.
technology support services technology support services consists primarily of costs related to the maintenance of computer equipment supporting our system architecture, circuits supporting our wide area network, support for production software, operating system license and support fees, fees paid to information vendors for displaying data and off-site system hosting fees.
professional fees and outside services professional fees and outside services consist primarily of consulting services, which include supplemental staff activities primarily related to systems development and maintenance, legal, regulatory and audit, and tax advisory services.
travel and promotional expenses travel and promotional expenses primarily consist of advertising, costs for special events, sponsorship of industry conferences, options education seminars and travel-related expenses.
facilities costs facilities costs primarily consist of expenses related to owned and leased properties including rent, maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes and telecommunications costs.
acquisition-related costs acquisition-related costs relate to acquisitions and other strategic opportunities. the acquisition-related costs include fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors, public relations firms, severance and retention costs, capitalized software and facilities, and other external costs directly related to the mergers and acquisitions.
goodwill impairment goodwill impairment consists of charges to impair goodwill of our reporting units if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.
68
other expenses other expenses represent costs necessary to support our operations that are not already included in the above categories, including, but not limited to the impairment of digital assets held presented in intangible assets, net as part of the ordinary operations of the digital segment and changes in contingent consideration.
non-operating (expenses) income income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating and are classified as other (expense) income. these activities primarily include interest earned on the investing of excess cash, interest expense related to outstanding debt facilities, dividend income, income and unrealized gains and losses related to investments held in a trust for the company's non-qualified retirement and benefit plans, realized gains and losses related to the company's previously held minority investments, equity earnings or losses from our investments in other business ventures, impairment of the company's investments, investment establishment costs associated with new business ventures, and loan forgiveness provided under the sba's paycheck protection program ("ppp"). see note 12 ("debt") for additional information regarding the ppp.
results of operations the following are summaries of changes in financial performance and include certain non-gaap financial measures. management uses these non-gaap measures internally in conjunction with gaap measures to help evaluate our performance and to help make financial and operational decisions. these non-gaap financial measures assist management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items management believes do not reflect our underlying operations.
we believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency into financial measures used by management and is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our ongoing operating performance.
these non-gaap financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, gaap financial measures and may be calculated differently from non-gaap measures used by other companies, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. we encourage analysts, investors and other interested parties to use these non-gaap measures as supplemental information to the gaap financial measures included herein, including our consolidated financial statements, to enhance their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons. please see the footnotes below for definitions, additional information, and reconciliations from the closest gaap measure.

(1)   organic net revenue is defined as revenues less cost of revenues excluding revenues less cost of revenues of any acquisition that has been owned for less than one year. revenues from acquisitions that have been owned at least one year are considered organic and are no longer excluded from organic net revenue from either period for comparative purposes. organic net revenue does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to revenues less cost of revenues, or net revenue, as determined in accordance with gaap. we have presented organic net revenue because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and we use it as the basis for monitoring our operating financial performance before the effects of acquisitions. we also believe that it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. we believe that investors may find this non-gaap measure useful in evaluating our performance compared to that of peer companies in our industry. other companies may calculate organic net revenue differently than we do. organic net revenue has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap.

(2)   ebitda is defined as income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda before acquisition-related costs, impairment of investment, gain on investment, investment establishment costs, impairment of goodwill, loan forgiveness, and change in contingent consideration. ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not represent, and should not be considered as, alternatives to net income as determined in accordance with gaap. we have presented ebitda and adjusted ebitda because we consider them important supplemental measures of our performance and believe that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. in addition, we use adjusted ebitda as a measure of operating performance for preparation of our forecasts and evaluating our leverage ratio for the debt to earnings covenant included in our outstanding credit facility. other companies may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do. ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap.

(3)   ebitda margin represents ebitda divided by revenues less cost of revenues.

(4)   adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda divided by revenues less cost of revenues.

(5)   adjusted earnings is defined as net income adjusted for amortization of purchased intangibles, acquisition-related costs, impairment of investment, gain on investment, investment establishment costs, impairment of goodwill, loan forgiveness, certain tax reserve changes, deferred tax re-measurements, change in contingent consideration, and net income or loss allocated to participating securities, net of the income tax effects of these adjustments. adjusted earnings does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net income, as determined in accordance with gaap. we have presented adjusted earnings because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and we use it as the basis for monitoring our own core operating financial performance relative to other operators of exchanges. we also believe that it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. we believe that investors may find this non-gaap measure useful in evaluating our performance compared to that of peer companies in our industry. other companies may calculate adjusted earnings differently than we do. adjusted earnings has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap.

(6)   adjusted diluted earnings per share represents adjusted earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding.

revenue total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased $463.7 million, or 13%, compared to the prior period primarily due to higher revenue across all revenue captions as a result of increased volumes traded on the options and european equities exchanges, an increase in the section 31 fee rate following a rate increase that was effective on may 14, 2022, an increase in data and access solutions revenue primarily related to an increase in access and capacity fees in the options and north american equities segments, and additional revenues attributable to acquisitions made in 2022 and the later half of 2021. the following summarizes changes in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 (in millions, except percentages):

the digital segment was established in the second quarter of 2022 following the acquisition of erisx, which was subsequently rebranded to cboe digital. cost of revenues exceeded revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily due to liquidity payments on spot and futures transactions, partially offset by transaction and clearing fees attributable to spot transactions. for the year ended december 31, 2022, the digital segment had an operating loss of $491.4 million, primarily due to $460.9 million impairment of goodwill.

liquidity and capital resources below are charts that reflect elements of our capital allocation:
we expect our cash on hand at december 31, 2022 and other available resources, including cash generated from operations, to be sufficient to continue to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. in the near term, we expect that our cash from operations and availability under the revolving credit facility, and potentially participating in future financing transactions to obtain additional capital will meet our cash needs to fund our operations, capital expenditures, interest payments on debt, debt repayments, such as under the term loan agreement, which matures on december 15, 2023, any dividends, potential strategic acquisitions, opportunities for common stock repurchases under the previously announced program, and payouts related to the unfavorable decision in the section 199 litigation. see note 12 ("debt") to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
cboe clear europe also has a €1.25 billion committed syndicated multicurrency revolving and swingline credit facility agreement with cboe clear europe as borrower and the company as guarantor of scheduled interest and fees on borrowings (but not the principal amount of any borrowings) (the "facility"). the facility is available to be drawn by cboe clear europe towards (a) financing unsettled amounts in connection with the settlement of transactions in securities and other items processed through cboe clear europe's clearing system and (b) financing any other liability or liquidity requirement of cboe clear europe incurred in the operation of its clearing system. borrowings under the facility are secured by cash, eligible bonds and eligible equity assets deposited by cboe clear europe into secured accounts. as a result, should the facility be drawn by cboe clear europe it could potentially impact cboe clear europe's liquidity, and we can give no assurance that this facility will be sufficient to meet all of such obligations or sufficiently mitigate cboe clear europe's liquidity risk to meet its payment obligations when due. additionally, a default of the facility may allow lenders, under certain circumstances, to accelerate any related drawn amounts and may result in the acceleration of the company's other outstanding debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which may limit the company's liquidity, business and financing activities. the facility was amended on june 30, 2022, which extended the term of the facility through june 29, 2023. please refer to note 12 ("debt") for further information on the amendment.
our long-term cash needs will depend on many factors, including an introduction of new products, enhancements of current products, the geographic mix of our business and any potential acquisitions. we believe our cash from operations and the availability under our revolving credit facility will meet any long-term needs unless a significant acquisition or acquisitions are identified, in which case we expect that we would be able to borrow the necessary funds and/or issue additional shares of our common stock to complete such acquisition(s).

cash and cash equivalents includes cash in banks and all non-restricted, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2022 increased $90.8 million from december 31, 2021 primarily due to additional borrowings on the term loan agreement, issuance of the 3.000% senior notes in the first quarter of 2022, and results of operations, partially offset by acquisitions, net of cash acquired and repayments on the term loan agreement. see "cash flow" below for further discussion.
our cash and cash equivalents held outside of the united states in various foreign subsidiaries totaled $226.1 million and $185.9 million as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the remaining balance was held in the united states and totaled $206.6 million and $156.0 million as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation, but under current law, could subject us to additional united states income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. see note 18 ("regulatory capital") for information regarding cash held for purposes of regulatory capital requirements.
our financial investments include deferred compensation plan assets as well as investments with original or acquired maturities longer than three months but that mature in less than one year from the balance sheet date and are recorded at fair value. as of december 31, 2022, financial investments primarily consisted of u.s. treasury securities and deferred compensation plan assets.

in addition to the debt outstanding, as of december 31, 2022, we had an additional $400.0 million available through our revolving credit facility, with the ability to borrow another $200.0 million by increasing the commitments under the facility. together with adjusted cash, we had $1.0 billion available to fund our operations, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, debt repayments and any dividends, net of regulatory capital requirements, as of december 31, 2022.
dividends the company's expectation is to continue to pay dividends. the decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of the company's board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant. future debt obligations and statutory provisions, among other things, may limit, or in some cases prohibit, our ability to pay dividends.
share repurchase program in 2011, the board of directors approved an initial authorization for the company to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock of $100 million and subsequently approved additional authorizations, for a total authorization of $1.6 billion. the program permits the company to purchase shares through a variety of methods, including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws. it does not obligate the company to make any repurchases at any specific time or situation. share repurchases are repurchased to the company's treasury stock and ultimately retired or they are available to be redistributed.
under the program, for the year ended december 31, 2022, the company repurchased 876,238 shares of common stock at an average cost per share of $115.20, totaling $100.9 million. since inception of the program through december

31, 2022, the company has repurchased 18,948,367 shares of common stock at an average cost per share of $70.30, totaling $1.3 billion. the company retired 744,127 and 18,072,129 shares of treasury stock in the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
on august 16, 2022, president biden signed into law h.r. 5376 (commonly known as the "inflation reduction act of 2022" or simply the "ira"). tax measures contained in the new law include, among other items, an excise tax of 1% on corporate stock buy-backs. the ira imposes a new 1% excise tax on repurchases of stock by domestic corporations with stock traded on established securities markets. the amount on which the tax is imposed is reduced by the value of any stock issued by such corporation during the tax year and the tax generally applies to stock buy-back transactions occurring after december 31, 2022. this new tax is not expected to result in a material impact to the company.
as of december 31, 2022, the company had $217.9 million of availability remaining under its existing share repurchase authorizations.
lease and obligations the company currently leases additional office space, data centers and remote network operations center, with lease terms remaining from 5 months to 174 months as of december 31, 2022. additionally, in october 2021, the company signed a new lease that commenced in february 2022 for a new principal office space in amsterdam. see note 24 ("leases") to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
total rent expense related to current and former lease obligations for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 totaled $30.0 million, $25.6 million and $20.2 million, respectively. in addition to our lease obligations, we have contractual obligations related to certain operating leases, data and telecommunications agreements, and our long-term debt outstanding.
purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed or minimum and maximum amounts to be paid; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations include certain licensing agreements with various licensors which contain annual minimum fee requirements as well as payments calculated using agreed upon contract rates and reported cleared volumes. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.
we have excluded from the contractual obligations listed below $543.0 million in cash margin deposits and clearing funds related to cboe clear europe and cboe clear digital. clearing participants of cboe clear europe are required to make deposits to a clearing fund. the cash deposits made by clearing participants are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with equal and offsetting current liabilities. see note 14 ("clearing operations") to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on cboe clear europe and cboe clear digital and the margin deposits and clearing funds.
future minimum payments under these leases and agreements were as follows as of december 31, 2022:

critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of the amounts of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ materially from those estimates. on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. the company bases its estimates on historical experience, observance of trends in particular areas, information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources.
we have identified the estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these estimates on our business operations is discussed throughout "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." for a detailed discussion on these estimates and other accounting policies, see note 2 ("summary of significant accounting policies") to the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
goodwill and other intangible assets description our acquisitions of bats, silexx financial systems, llc ("silexx"), livevol, inc. ("livevol"), hanweck, ft options, trade alert, matchnow, bids holdings, cboe asia pacific, cboe digital, and neo resulted in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, while our acquisition of cboe clear europe, resulted in a bargain purchase gain and other intangible assets. in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification ("asc") 350 - intangibles - goodwill and
93
other, we test the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances signal indicators of impairment are present.
judgments and uncertainties the estimated fair values of our reporting units are based on the market approach and the income approach (using discounted estimated future cash flows). the estimated fair values of indefinite-lived intangibles are based on the cost method and income approach. the discounted estimated future cash flow analysis requires judgments about the discount rate, forecasted revenue growth rate, and operating expenses, that are inherent in these fair value estimates over the estimated remaining operating period. additionally, the analysis contains uncertainty surrounding future events. as such, actual results may differ from these estimates and lead to a revaluation of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if updated estimates indicate that the fair value of goodwill or any indefinite-lived intangibles is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment charge is expected to be recorded in the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change in estimate, which could result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements.
following the acquisition of cboe digital in the quarter ended june 30, 2022, negative events and trends in the broader digital asset environment emerged, such as deleveraging and bankruptcies, and certain negative trends in the broader digital asset environment that started in late 2021 intensified, such as the decline in digital asset prices, overall market activity, and market capitalization. additionally, following the acquisition of cboe digital , the efforts to syndicate minority ownership interests in cboe digital to potential investors during the quarter ended june 30, 2022 became more challenging, and the outlook for the digital segment's future market growth was negatively impacted. the company considered these developments, in particular the syndication efforts during the quarter ended june 30, 2022, to be potential indications of impairment and performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill recognized in the digital reporting unit during the quarter ended june 30, 2022. the company concluded that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, which was based on the income approach and corroborated with the market approach, and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $460.1 million in the consolidated statements of income during the quarter ended june 30, 2022, and also recognized a deferred tax asset of $116.2 million. this deferred tax asset, resulting from the excess of tax-deductible goodwill over book goodwill, relates to future tax deductions the company expects to realize to reduce potential tax payments on future income. as a result, the carrying value of cboe digital decreased by $343.9 million, to $220.0 million as of june 30, 2022. the company also performed testing over the intangible assets recognized as a result of the cboe digital acquisition during the quarter ended june 30, 2022, and based on the results of the assessments, determined there was no impairment required as the fair value approximated the carrying value. no other long lived assets were recognized as a result of the acquisition and subject to further assessment.
as a result of the finalization of the net working capital calculation associated with the acquisition of cboe digital during the quarter ended september 30, 2022, the company recorded additional goodwill of $0.8 million. subsequently, the company concluded that the indicators of impairment outlined in the previous paragraph continued to be relevant and recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of $0.8 million in the consolidated statements of income for the three months ended september 30, 2022, resulting in the write-down of the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of cboe digital to zero.

judgments and uncertainties on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its tax estimates and judgments. this evaluation is based on factors including historical experience, such as the conclusions of examinations by tax authorities, changes in tax laws or rates, new examination activity, and results of any related legal processes. we use judgment in the evaluation of uncertain tax positions and the estimation of unrecognized tax benefits when determining the largest amount greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority, assessing the likelihood of the benefit being realized upon settlement, and the calculating expected ultimate settlement amount.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions significant changes in these estimates or judgments may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a future period. additionally, it is possible that the ultimate settlement may differ from the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits currently reported if tax authorities ultimately reach a conclusion that differs from the company's expectation. we believe assumptions made regarding income taxes to be reasonable and do not believe any change in the judgments made by management would result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements.

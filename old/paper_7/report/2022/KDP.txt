as adjusted, in millions (except diluted eps)
on october 6, 2022, we announced a strategic partnership with red bull, the iconic global energy brand, to sell and distribute red bull energy drink products in mexico, which began in the fourth quarter of 2022.

as a result of our quarterly triggering events assessment and our annual impairment assessment, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $472 million on indefinite-lived brands during the year ended december 31, 2022, led by bai and schweppes. refer to note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
uncertainties and trends affecting our business we believe the north american beverage market is influenced by certain key trends and uncertainties. refer to item 1a, risk factors, as well as the uncertainties and trends affecting liquidity section below, for more information about risks and uncertainties facing us.
some of these items, such as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and the invasion of ukraine by russia, and the resulting impacts on the global economy, including supply chain constraints and labor shortages, have led to inflation in input costs, logistics, manufacturing and labor costs, which has further led to fluctuation in interest rates. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we have experienced supply chain disruptions and a significant inflationary impact compared to the prior year. these impacts have created headwinds for our industry that we expect to continue into 2023.
as a result of these inflationary pressures, we have increased the pricing on a number of our products across our portfolio. consequently, we may incur a reduction of volume or net sales, which, combined with the inflationary pressures, could impact our margins and operating results.
refer to note 5 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements and item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for management's discussion of how we manage our exposure to commodity risk.

income from operations. income from operations decreased $289 million, or 10.0%, to $2,605 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to $2,894 million in the prior year, primarily driven by the non-cash impairment charges of $477 million, which was partially offset by the gain on the litigation settlement. other factors include higher sg&a expenses, partially offset by increased gross profit. operating margin decreased 430 bps versus the year ago period to 18.5%.
interest expense. interest expense increased $193 million, or 38.6%, to $693 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to $500 million for the prior year. this change was primarily driven by the unfavorable comparison of unrealized mark-to-market losses of $255 million on interest rate contracts, which was partially offset by reduced interest expense on our senior unsecured notes as a result of our strategic refinancing initiatives.
loss on early extinguishment of debt. loss on early extinguishment of debt reflected an unfavorable change of $112 million, with a loss of $217 million during the year ended december 31, 2022 related to our 2022 strategic refinancing and our early retirement of our 2038 notes, the 2021 364-day credit agreement and the kdp revolver, as compared to a loss of $105 million in the prior year associated with our 2021 strategic refinancing.
gain on sale of equity method investment. for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 we recorded $50 million and $524 million, respectively, for the sale of our equity method investment in bodyarmor. the amount recorded in 2022 represents the portion of the settlement payment from bodyarmor that was allocated to the satisfaction of the holdback amount owed to us. refer to note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

effective tax rate. the effective tax rate decreased 680 bps to 16.5% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to 23.3% in the prior year, primarily driven by the revaluation of state deferred tax liabilities due to legislative changes and the favorable mix of our incremental income in low tax jurisdictions in the year.
net income attributable to kdp. net income attributable to kdp decreased $710 million, or 33.1%, to $1,436 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to $2,146 million in the prior year, primarily driven by the unfavorable change in gain on sale of our equity method investment in bodyarmor, lower income from operations, increased interest expense, and the unfavorable change in loss on early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by the decrease in our effective tax rate.
diluted eps. diluted eps decreased 32.7% to $1.01 per diluted share as compared to $1.50 in the prior year.

net sales. net sales increased 5.6% to $4,982 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to $4,716 million in the prior year, driven by favorable net price realization of 7.0%, partially offset by volume/mix declines of 0.8% and unfavorable fx translation of 0.6%.
income from operations. income from operations decreased $130 million, or 9.0%, to $1,316 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $1,446 million in the prior year, as a result of broad-based inflation, particularly in green coffee and packaging and increases in other operating expenses. these decreases were partially offset by the benefits of net sales growth, productivity, favorable asset sale-leaseback activity of $44 million in the coffee systems segment associated with our strategic asset investment program and a business interruption insurance recovery. operating margin declined 430 bps versus the prior year to 26.4%, primarily due to the aforementioned inflationary headwinds.

net sales. net sales increased 12.3% to $6,607 million in the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $5,882 million in the prior year, driven by favorable net price realization of 12.1% and volume/mix growth of 0.3%, slightly offset by unfavorable fx translation of 0.1%.
income from operations. income from operations decreased $9 million, or 0.9%, to $1,014 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to $1,023 million for the prior year, primarily driven by the $316 million non-cash impairment charges in the segment, predominantly related to bai, which were partially offset by the gain on the settlement of litigation with bodyarmor of $271 million. other offsetting factors included the benefits of net sales growth, productivity, and reduced restructuring and integration expense, partially offset by broad-based inflation, higher costs to serve the ongoing strong consumer demand, and the unfavorable year-over-year comparison in the packaged beverages segment of asset sale-leaseback activity associated with our strategic asset investment program. operating margin declined 210 bps versus the prior year to 15.3%.

liquidity and capital resources overview we believe our financial condition and liquidity remain strong. we continue to manage all aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, monitoring the financial health of our customers, suppliers and other third-party relationships, implementing cost management strategies through our productivity initiatives, and developing new opportunities for growth such as innovation and agreements with partners to distribute brands that are accretive to our portfolio.
the following summarizes our cash activity for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:
cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents decreased $33 million from december 31, 2021 to december 31, 2022 primarily as a result of our investment in nutrabolt, offset by proceeds from the cash settlement with bodyarmor.
cash generated by our foreign operations is generally repatriated to the u.s. periodically as working capital funding requirements where allowed. we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside the u.s. to have a material effect on our overall business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future .

additionally, in april 2022, we chose to undertake our 2022 strategic refinancing, issuing approximately $3 billion of senior unsecured notes and using the net proceeds to voluntarily prepay and retire several tranches of existing senior unsecured notes with higher interest rates, which reduced our overall interest payments and our annual cash requirements. as part of this transaction, we additionally unwound approximately $1.5 billion of notional amount of our outstanding designated forward starting swaps and received cash proceeds of approximately $125 million. refer to note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information about the 2022 strategic refinancing initiative.
principal sources of capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from our operations and borrowing capacity currently available under our 2022 revolving credit agreement. additionally, we have an uncommitted commercial paper program where we can issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis. based on our current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months. to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements, if necessary.
sources of liquidity - operations net cash provided by operating activities decreased $37 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, driven by the decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items and the impact of the change in working capital.
cash conversion cycle our cash conversion cycle is defined as dio and dso less dpo. the calculation of each component of the cash conversion cycle is provided below:
component         calculation (on a trailing twelve month basis)

cash conversion cycle                     (60)                      (69)
our cash conversion cycle increased 9 days to approximately (60) days as of december 31, 2022 as compared to (69) days as of december 31, 2021. the increases in dso and dpo were primarily driven by rising inflation during the year, and the increase in dio reflects our efforts to restore inventory to meet customer service levels.
accounts payable program as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our cash flow and related liquidity, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. excluding our suppliers who require cash at date of purchase or sale, our current payment terms with our suppliers generally range from 10 to 360 days. we also enter into agreements with third party administrators to allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us, and if voluntarily elected by the supplier, sell payment obligations from us to financial institutions. suppliers can sell one or more of our payment obligations at their sole discretion and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted. we have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions. our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted.
we have been informed by the third party administrators that as of december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, $3,839 million and $3,194 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations were voluntarily elected by the supplier and sold to financial institutions. the amounts settled through the program and paid to the financial institutions were $3,935 million, $3,331 million and $2,770 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
impact of the cares act beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we deferred payments of employer-related payroll taxes as allowed under the cares act. payment of at least 50% of the deferred amount was due on january 3, 2022, with the remainder due by january 3, 2023. we deferred a total of $59 million in such payments since the cares act was implemented, and we timely paid approximately $30 million as of january 3, 2022 and the remainder as of january 3, 2023.
sources of liquidity - financing in february 2022, we terminated our 2021 364-day credit agreement and our kdp revolver and replaced them with the 2022 revolving credit agreement, which provides for a $4 billion revolving credit facility.
in april 2022, we undertook our 2022 strategic refinancing and issued a $3 billion aggregate face value of notes, consisting of the 2029 notes, the 2032 notes, and the 2052 notes. the proceeds from the issuance were used to voluntarily prepay and retire the remaining 2023 merger notes and to tender portions of the 2025 merger notes, the 2028 merger notes, the 2038 merger notes, and the 2048 merger notes.
we have a commercial paper program, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2,400 million. as of december 31, 2022, we had borrowings of $399 million outstanding.
we also have an active shelf registration statement, filed with the sec on august 19, 2022, which allows us to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants from time to time in one or more offerings at the direction of our board of directors.
refer to note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for management's discussion of our financing arrangements.
sources of liquidity - asset sale-leaseback transactions we have leveraged our strategic asset investment program to create value from certain assets to enable reinvestment in kdp. these transactions are accounted for as sale-leaseback transactions. we received $168 million, $102 million, and $200 million of net cash proceeds from our strategic asset investment program during the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are included in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
debt ratings as of december 31, 2022, our credit ratings were as follows:
rating agency        long-term debt rating         commercial paper rating       outlook        date of last change moody's              baa2                          p-2                           stable         february 26, 2021

these debt and commercial paper ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangements. a downgrade of one or both of our debt and commercial paper ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations. as of december 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and we have no reason to believe that we will be unable to satisfy these covenants.
libor considerations in 2017, the u.k. financial conduct authority announced that libor will no longer be published after 2021. in the u.s., the alternative reference rates committee selected the sofr as the preferred alternative reference rate to libor. certain libor tenors will continue to be published through june 30, 2023.
we have a number of financing arrangements which incorporate libor as a benchmark rate and which extend past 2022. the agreements related to such financing arrangements use libor tenors which will continue to be published through june 30, 2023. additionally, these agreements contain provisions for alternative reference rates. we do not expect a significant change to our cost of debt as a result of the transition from libor to an alternative reference rate.
principal uses of capital resources over the past several years, our principal uses of our capital resources were deleveraging, providing shareholder return to our investors through regular quarterly dividends, and investing in kdp to capture market share and drive growth through innovation and routes to market.
now that we have met our post-merger goals, we plan to further reduce our leverage ratio. we also plan to invest in inorganic value creation through m&a, including portfolio expansion, distribution scale, geographic expansion, and new capabilities. in addition to m&a, we have repurchased shares of our outstanding common stock, as described below.
deleveraging and other debt repayments during the year ended december 31, 2022, we made net debt repayments of $115 million, primarily driven by the redemption and retirement of the remainder of our 2023 merger notes and 2038 notes, as well as the tender of portions of the 2025 merger notes, the 2028 merger notes, the 2038 merger notes, and the 2048 merger notes.
regular quarterly dividends for the year ended december 31, 2022, we have declared total dividends of $0.775 per share, versus $0.7125 per share for the year ended december 31, 2021.
repurchases of common stock our board authorized a four-year share repurchase program of up to $4 billion of our outstanding common stock potentially enabling us to return value to shareholders. we repurchased and retired $379 million of common stock during the year ended december 31, 2022.
capital expenditures we are investing in state-of-the-art manufacturing and warehousing facilities, including expansive investments in facilities in newbridge, ireland; spartanburg, south carolina; and allentown, pennsylvania, in 2022 and 2021, in order to optimize our supply chain network.
purchases of property, plant and equipment were $353 million, $423 million and $461 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. capital expenditures, which includes both purchases of property, plant and equipment and amounts included in accounts payable and accrued expenses, for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 primarily related to the manufacturing and warehousing facilities discussed above. capital expenditures included in accounts payable and accrued expenses were $213 million, $189 million and $280 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which primarily related to these investments.
investments in unconsolidated affiliates from time to time, we expect to invest in beverage startup companies or in brand ownership companies to grow our presence in certain product categories, or enter into various licensing and distribution agreements to expand our product portfolio. our investments in beverage startup companies generally involve acquiring a minority interest in equity securities of a company, in certain cases with a protected path to ownership at our future option. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we invested $972 million in exchange for equity interests in nutrabolt, tractor and athletic brewing.
purchases of intangible assets we have invested in the expansion of our dsd network through transactions with strategic independent bottlers to ensure competitive distribution scale for our brands. from time to time, we additionally acquire brand ownership companies to expand our portfolio. these transactions are generally accounted for as an asset acquisition, as the majority of the transaction price represents the acquisition of an intangible asset. purchases of intangible assets were $45 million, $32 million and $56 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
residual value guarantees we have a number of leasing arrangements and one licensing arrangement with special purpose entities associated with the same sponsor. each one of these arrangements contain a residual value guarantee. as of december 31, 2022, we have not recorded any liabilities as it is not probable that we will have to make any payments required under the residual value guarantee. refer to note 19 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
uncertainties and trends affecting liquidity and capital resources disruptions in financial and credit markets, including those caused by inflation due to global economic uncertainty and the associated rise in interest rates, may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us, thus reducing our cash flow, or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials.
customer and consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by the risk factors discussed under "risk factors" in part 1, item 1a of our annual report, as well as subsequent filings with the sec, that could have a material effect on production, delivery and consumption of our products, which could result in a reduction in our sales volume.
we believe that the following events, trends and uncertainties may also impact liquidity:
•our ability to either repay existing debt maturities through cash flow from operations or refinance through future issuances of senior unsecured notes;
•our ability to access and/or renew our committed financing arrangements;
•a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could limit i) our ability to issue debt at terms that are favorable to us, or ii) a financial institution's willingness to participate in our accounts payable program and reduce the attractiveness of the accounts payable program to participating suppliers who may sell payment obligations from us to financial institutions, which could impact our accounts payable program;
•our continued payment of regular quarterly dividends;
•future opportunistic repurchases of our common stock or special dividends to drive total shareholder return;
•our continued capital expenditures;
•future equity investments;
•seasonality of our operating cash flows, which could impact short-term liquidity;
•our ability to issue unsecured uncommitted commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2,400 million;
•future mergers or acquisitions, which may include brand ownership companies, regional bottling companies, distributors and/or distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage; and
•fluctuations in our tax obligations.
critical accounting estimates the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results and require difficult, subjective or complex estimates and assessments. these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary. we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess or measure our critical accounting estimates. we have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements. see note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies.
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets we conduct tests for impairment of our goodwill and our other indefinite lived intangible assets annually, as of october 1, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. we use present value and other valuation techniques to make this assessment. if the carrying amount of goodwill or an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. for purposes of impairment testing, we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising from each business combination, and we also assign indefinite lived intangible assets to our reporting units.
effective january 1, 2021, we modified our internal reporting and operating segments to reflect changes in the executive leadership team to further enhance speed-to-market and decision effectiveness. although this did not change our reportable segments, our reporting units and operating segments were redefined. for 2022 and 2021, we defined our six reporting units as follows:
reportable segments           reporting units packaged beverages            dsd wd coffee systems                coffee systems beverage concentrates         branded concentrates fountain foodservice latin america beverages       latin america beverages for both goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of either the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is "more likely than not" less than its carrying value, also known as a step 0 analysis. if a quantitative analysis is required, the following would be required:
•the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, impairment is recorded.
•the impairment tests for goodwill include comparing fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill and considering any indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges.
as of october 1, 2022, we performed a quantitative analysis for goodwill and certain indefinite lived brand assets, whereby we used an income approach, or in some cases a combination of income and market based approaches, to determine the fair value of our assets, as well as an overall consideration of market capitalization and enterprise value. we performed a qualitative step 0 analysis for other indefinite lived intangible assets, including certain brands, trade names, contractual arrangements, and distribution rights. these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. these assumptions could be negatively impacted by various risks discussed in item 1a, risk factors, in this annual report on form 10-k.
critical assumptions for quantitative analyses include revenue growth and profit performance over the next five year period, as well as an appropriate discount rate and long-term growth rate, as applicable. discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt, adjusted with various risk premiums. long-term growth rates are based on the long-term inflation forecast, industry growth and the long-term economic growth potential.
the following table provides the range of rates used in the analysis as of october 1, 2022:
rate                                   minimum                      maximum discount rates                7.3                %                10.3    %

refer to note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our impairment assessments.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. accruals for customer incentives, sales returns and marketing programs are established for the expected payout based on contractual terms, volume-based metrics and/or historical trends.
our customer incentives, sales returns and marketing accrual methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding our contractual terms in order to estimate our customer participation and volume performance levels which impact the expense recognition. our estimates are based primarily on a combination of known or historical transaction experiences. differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized to earnings in the period differences are determined.
additionally, judgment is required to ensure the classification of the spend is correctly recorded as either a reduction from gross sales or advertising and marketing expense, which is a component of our sg&a expenses.
a 10% change in the accrual for our customer incentives, sales returns and marketing programs would have affected our income from operations by $50 million for the year ended december 31, 2022.
income taxes we establish income tax liabilities to remove some or all of the income tax benefit of any of our income tax positions based upon one of the following:
•the tax position is not "more likely than not" to be sustained,
•the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or
•the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.
our liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions.
our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. as these audits progress, events may occur that cause us to change our liability for uncertain tax positions. to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for uncertain tax positions has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.
we also assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets. valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized. we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets primarily on historical earnings, our estimate of current and expected future earnings and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
if results differ from our assumptions, a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may be increased or decreased which would impact our effective tax rate.
business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. the fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. significant assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset, if applicable.
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be exposed to potential impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, as discussed in the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets critical accounting estimate section above.

non-gaap financial measures to supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with u.s. gaap, we have presented for certain constant currency adjusted or adjusted financial measures for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, which are considered non-gaap financial measures. the non-gaap financial measures provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the non-gaap financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-gaap financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-gaap financial measures in the same way. the non-gaap financial measures are not substitutes for their comparable u.s. gaap financial measures, such as income from operations, net income, diluted eps or other measures prescribed by u.s. gaap, and there are limitations to using non-gaap financial measures. we use these non-gaap financial measures, in addition to u.s. gaap financial measures, to evaluate our operating and financial performance and to compare such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. additionally, we use these non-gaap financial measures in making operational and financial decisions and in our budgeting and planning process. we believe that providing these non-gaap financial measures to investors helps investors evaluate our operating performance, profitability and business trends in a way that is consistent with how management evaluates such performance and consistent with guidance previously provided by us. the non-gaap measures are defined as follows:
adjusted: defined as certain financial statement captions and metrics adjusted for certain items affecting comparability.
items affecting comparability: defined as certain items that are excluded for comparison to prior year periods, adjusted for the tax impact as applicable. tax impact is determined based upon an approximate rate for each item. for each period, management adjusts for (i) the unrealized mark-to-market impact of derivative instruments not designated as hedges in accordance with u.s. gaap that do not have an offsetting risk reflected within the financial results, as well as the unrealized mark-to-market impact of our vita coco investment; (ii) the amortization associated with definite-lived intangible assets; (iii) the amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the dps merger; (iv) the amortization of the fair value adjustment of the senior unsecured notes obtained as a result of the dps merger; (v) stock compensation expense and the associated windfall tax benefit attributable to the matching awards made to employees who made an initial investment in kdp; (vi) non-cash changes in deferred tax liabilities related to goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of tax rate or apportionment changes; and (vii) other certain items that are excluded for comparison purposes to prior year periods.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, the other certain items excluded for comparison purposes include (i) restructuring and integration expenses related to significant business combinations; (ii) productivity expenses; (iii) costs related to significant non-routine legal matters, specifically the antitrust litigation; (iv) the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of debt; (v) incremental costs to our operations related to risks associated with the covid-19 pandemic, which were incurred to either maintain the health and safety of our front-line employees or temporarily increase compensation to such employees to ensure essential operations continue during the pandemic; (vi) the gain on the sale of our investment in bodyarmor as a result of the settlement of the associated holdback liability; (vii) the gain on the settlement of our prior litigation with bodyarmor, excluding recoveries of previously incurred litigation expenses which were included in our adjusted results; (viii) losses recognized with respect to our equity method investment in bedford as a result of funding our share of their wind-down costs; (ix) transaction costs for significant business combinations (completed or abandoned); (x) foundational projects, which are transformative and non-recurring in nature; and (xi) impairments recognized on certain intangible brand assets.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, the other certain items excluded for comparison purposes include (i) restructuring and integration expenses related to significant business combinations; (ii) productivity expenses; (iii) costs related to significant non-routine legal matters; (iv) the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of debt; (v) incremental costs to our operations related to risks associated with the covid-19 pandemic; (vi) gains from insurance recoveries related to the february 2019 organized malware attack on our business operation networks in the coffee systems segment; (vii) the gain on the sale of our investment in bodyarmor; (viii) impairment recognized on our equity method investment with bedford as a result of funding our share of their wind-down costs; and (ix) transaction costs for significant business combinations (completed or abandoned).
constant currency adjusted: defined as certain financial statement captions and metrics adjusted for certain items affecting comparability, calculated on a constant currency basis by converting our current period local currency financial results using the prior period foreign currency exchange rates.
for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, the supplemental financial data set forth below includes reconciliations of adjusted and constant currency adjusted financial measures to the applicable financial measure presented in the consolidated financial statements for the same period.

constant currency adjusted results of operations year ended december 31, 2022 compared to year ended december 31, 2021
the following discussion of our results for the year ended december 31, 2022 is presented on a constant currency adjusted basis. these adjusted financial results are calculated on a constant currency basis by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior-period fx rates.
consolidated operations constant currency net sales. constant currency net sales increased 11.1% in the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior year, driven by favorable net price realization of 10.6% and volume/mix growth of 0.5%.
constant currency adjusted income from operations. constant currency adjusted income from operations increased 3.7% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the strong growth in net sales and the benefit of productivity. these benefits were partially offset by the impact of broad-based inflation and increases in other operating costs.
constant currency adjusted interest expense. constant currency adjusted interest expense decreased 11.9% compared to the prior year, driven by reduced interest expense on our senior unsecured notes as a result of our strategic refinancing initiatives.
constant currency adjusted effective tax rate. the constant currency adjusted effective tax rate was 22.6% for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 22.7% for the prior year, primarily driven by our incremental income in low tax jurisdictions in the current year, mostly offset by the unfavorable comparison to the tax benefit received in the prior year from the release of our valuation allowance against our u.s. foreign tax credit carryforwards.
constant currency adjusted net income attributable to kdp. constant currency adjusted net income attributable to kdp increased 5.4% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by income from operations growth and lower interest expense.
constant currency adjusted diluted eps. constant currency adjusted diluted eps increased approximately 5.0% over the prior year.
results of operations by segment coffee systems constant currency net sales. constant currency net sales increased 6.2%, driven by higher net price realization of 7.0%, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix of 0.8%.
constant currency adjusted income from operations.  constant currency adjusted income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 decreased 7.5% compared to the prior year period, as a result of broad-based inflation, particularly in green coffee and increases in other operating expenses. these decreases were partially offset by the benefits of net sales growth, productivity, favorable asset sale-leaseback activity in the coffee systems segment associated with our strategic asset investment program and a business interruption insurance recovery.
packaged beverages constant currency net sales. constant currency net sales increased 12.4%, reflecting favorable net price realization of 12.1% and volume/mix growth of 0.3%.
constant currency adjusted income from operations. constant currency adjusted income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased 1.2% compared to the prior year period, driven by the benefits of net sales growth and increased productivity. these benefits were partially offset by broad-based inflation, higher costs to serve the ongoing strong consumer demand, and the unfavorable year-over-year comparison in the packaged beverages segment of asset sale-leaseback activity associated with our strategic asset investment program.
beverage concentrates constant currency net sales. constant currency net sales increased 16.4%, reflecting higher net price realization of 14.7% and volume/mix growth of 1.7%.
constant currency adjusted income from operations. constant currency adjusted income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased 16.9% compared to the prior year period. this performance reflected the impact of net sales growth, partially offset by costs associated with the operation of our new manufacturing facility in newbridge, ireland.
latin america beverages constant currency net sales. constant currency net sales increased 23.0%, driven by favorable net price realization of 13.9% and volume/mix growth of 9.1%.
constant currency adjusted income from operations. constant currency adjusted income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased 18.5% compared to the prior year period, driven by the benefits of net sales growth and productivity, partially offset by the impacts of broad-based inflation, logistics and operating costs associated with incremental volumes, and increased marketing expense.

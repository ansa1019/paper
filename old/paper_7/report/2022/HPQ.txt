hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
overview we are a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies, solutions, and services. we sell to individual consumers, smbs and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health, and education sectors. we have three reportable segments: personal systems, printing and corporate investments. the personal systems segment offers commercial and consumer desktop and notebook pcs, workstations, thin clients, commercial mobility devices, retail pos systems, displays and peripherals, software, support, and services. the printing segment provides consumer and commercial printer hardware, supplies, solutions and services. corporate investments include hp labs and certain business incubation and investment projects.
•in personal systems, our strategic focus is on:
◦profitable growth through innovation, market segmentation and simplification of our portfolio
◦enhanced innovation in multi-operating systems, multi-architecture, geography, customer segments and other key attributes;
◦investing in endpoint services and solutions. we are focused on services, including device as a service, as the market begins to shift to contractual solutions, and accelerating in attractive adjacencies such as peripherals; and
◦driving innovation to enable productivity and collaboration with the pc becoming essential for hybrid work, learn and play.
we believe that we are well positioned due to our competitive product lineup along with our recent acquisitions in peripherals and remote-computing solutions.
•in printing, our strategic focus is on:
◦offering innovative printing solutions and contractual solutions to serve consumers, smbs and large enterprises through our instant ink services, hp+ and managed print services solutions;
◦providing digital printing solutions for graphics segments and applications including commercial publishing, labels, packaging, and textiles; and
◦expanding our footprint in 3d printing across digital manufacturing and strategic applications.
in addition to growing our subscription business, we are also focused on rebalancing system profitability to more upfront profitable hardware sales through our product offerings including hp+ and big tank.
we are committed to growing our peripherals, gaming, workforce solutions, consumer subscriptions, 3d and industrial graphics businesses. our ability to innovate is helping us gain momentum in growth areas like gaming and peripherals, and we see significant opportunities to drive greater recurring revenues across personal systems and printing. our acquisition of poly adds to our growth portfolio by bringing industry-leading video conferencing solutions, cameras, headsets, voice and software capabilities. to drive more integration across our commercial services, software and security portfolio, we have created a new workforce services and solutions organization. we continue to build on strong portfolios like instant ink to grow our consumer subscription business. in industrial graphics, we are driving the shift from analog to digital in segments like labels and packaging. in personalization & 3d, we are creating end-to-end solutions that can capture more value with our differentiated technology.
we continue to experience challenges that are representative of the trends and uncertainties that may affect our industry, generally, and our business and financial results, specifically, and we expect these challenges to continue in the short-term. one set of challenges relates to the current macroeconomic environment and the adverse impact on demand for certain of our products and product mix. a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. our primary competitors are exerting competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others. a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution in an evolving distribution and reseller landscape, with increasing online and omnichannel presence. additional challenges we face at the segment level, and that we expect to continue facing in the short-term are set forth below.
•in personal systems, we face challenges with competitive pricing environment, supply shortages in certain parts of business, elevated commodity and logistics costs compared to pre-pandemic levels. we are also experiencing softness in demand resulting in overall decline in personal systems market.
•in printing, we face challenges from a competitive environment, including non-original supplies (which includes imitation, refill, or remanufactured alternatives), and we face component constraints which we expect to continue to negatively impact our financial performance in the short term. we also obtain many printing components from single hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations source due to technology, availability, price, quality, or other considerations. for instance, we source the majority of our a4 and a portion of our a3 portfolio of laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon. any decision by either party to not renew our agreement with canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products; however, we have a long-standing business relationship with canon and anticipate renewal of this agreement.
to address these challenges, we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners. in addition, we continue to work on improving our operations and adapting our business models, with a particular focus on enhancing our end-to-end processes, analytics, efficiencies and simplification of our product portfolio. we also continue to work on optimizing our sales coverage models, aligning our sales incentives with our strategic goals, improving channel execution and inventory, production and backlog management, strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, effective cost management, strengthening our pricing discipline, and developing and capitalizing on market opportunities.
macroeconomic environment our business and financial performance also depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. we face global macroeconomic challenges, particularly in light of the effects of the ongoing geopolitical conflicts in ukraine, tensions across the taiwan strait, the covid-19 pandemic, tariff-driven headwinds, uncertainty in the markets, volatility in exchange rates, inflationary trends and evolving dynamics in the global trade environment. throughout fiscal 2022, we observed significant market uncertainty, increasing inflationary pressures, supply constraints and a strengthening u.s. dollar, as well as ongoing effects from the covid-19 pandemic. these market dynamics, which we expect will continue in the short-term, have created new and different demand dynamics in our markets and have had significant impacts on our financial results.
while our personal systems business benefited from the hybrid work environment and growth in gaming driven by the covid-19 pandemic, these trends and consumer behavior have started to change as a result of various macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to inflation, foreign currency, and lower consumer spending. beginning third quarter of fiscal 2022, we observed an accelerated decline in consumer demand, particularly with respect to consumer pcs. this decline in demand is in line with industry-wide declines and we expect this to continue for fiscal 2023. for the fiscal year 2022, we continued to see strong demand in windows-based commercial pcs, and mix shifts from low end to premium products. however, we anticipate the overall macroeconomic environment to continue to adversely impact the demand for commercial pcs in the short-term. in printing, we continued to see gradual and uneven recovery in commercial print, driven by the slow return of workers to the office, and softening of demand in consumer print, which accelerated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. also, we experienced an increasingly competitive pricing environment in the second half of fiscal 2022, which we expect to continue in the short-term, due to the macroeconomic environment across personal systems and printing. further, our operating margins were negatively impacted by the higher cost due to inflationary pressures. in fiscal 2023, we expect decline in both personal systems and printing market compared to fiscal 2022.
supply chain dynamics have impacted and we expect will continue to impact logistics and component costs at least in the short term, with logistics costs remaining elevated for the fiscal year as a result of both expedited shipments of components and overall rate costs in the freight network, while capacity improved in the second half of fiscal 2022. additionally, we expect industry wide commodity and component constraints, including application specific integrated circuits ("asics") that are unique to our products in personal systems and printing, to continue to impact our businesses in the short-term. we continue to monitor the covid-19 pandemic and variants of the coronavirus, as well as the impact the pandemic has on our employees, customers, business partners, and communities. we have experienced and may experience future disruptions in supply, manufacturing and logistics, particularly in asia, and with our suppliers and outsourcing partners globally as a result of covid-19.
in addition to the macroeconomic dynamics, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we have a large global presence, with more than 65% of our net revenue for fiscal 2022 coming from outside the united states. as a result, our financial results can be, and particularly in recent periods have been, impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we expect foreign currency fluctuations to continue to negatively impact our financial results in the fiscal 2023.
on may 31, 2022, we announced our decision to wind down business operations in russia having already suspended all new shipments and paused our marketing and advertising activities in february 2022. russia contributed approximately $1.0 billion of total net revenue in fiscal 2021. in the second half of fiscal 2022, we recognized a charge of $23 million towards severance, cancellation of contracts, inventory write-downs and other one-time exit charges related to our decision. a significant escalation or expansion of the situation's current scope could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. we continue to be focused on the safety and security of our employees and their families in the impacted regions and we have provided, and expect to continue to provide grants to support ukrainian relief efforts.
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we typically experience higher net revenues in our fourth fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due, in part, to seasonal holiday demand. historical seasonal patterns may not continue in the future and have been impacted by supply constraints, shifts in customer behavior, continuing impacts of the macroeconomic challenges and different demand dynamics.
for a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results, see the section entitled "risk factors" in item 1a of part i in this annual report on form 10-k.
transformation update in october 2019, we announced cost-reduction and operational efficiency initiatives intended to simplify the way we work, move us closer to our customers, and facilitate specific investment in our business. these initiatives were further updated in february 2020. these efforts included transforming our operating model to integrate our sales force into a single commercial organization and reducing structural costs across hp through our restructuring plan approved in september 2019 (the "fiscal 2020 plan").
in the third year of our program, we completed our fiscal 2020 plan, generating over $1.3 billion dollars in gross annual run-rate structural costs savings, ahead of our $1.2 billion dollar goal. we have changed our operating model to simplify the way we are structured and the way we work to free up capacity, create scale, efficiency, and effectiveness. we focused on real estate and site optimization in alignment with our location strategy. we have also focused on creating efficient digital workspaces with the transition to a hybrid work model, which is in line with real estate optimization. we made significant progress in optimizing our manufacturing footprint including factory locations (china, india, puerto rico) while investing in a best-in-class supply chain network and product supply resiliency. we have invested a portion of the savings from these efforts across our businesses, including investing to build our digital capabilities such as deployment of our sap s/4 hana system, one of the largest erp implementations. now that the fiscal 2020 plan is complete, we are now starting on the next phase in our transformation.
in november 2022, we announced our future ready plan (the "fiscal 2023 plan") to become a more digitally enabled company, focus investments on key growth opportunities and simplify our operating model. the new fiscal 2023 plan is expected to run for three years through end of fiscal 2025. the three key elements of our fiscal 2023 plan are digital transformation, portfolio optimization, and operational efficiency. as part of digital transformation, we will continue the process of digitizing the company to simplify and accelerate many processes through automation and end-to-end management. as part of optimizing our portfolio, we plan to continue to invest in our key growth areas of peripherals, gaming, workforce services & solutions, consumer subscriptions and industrial graphics and 3d, to drive competitive advantage and market leadership and we also plan to simplify our portfolio to reduce complexity. further to achieve operational efficiency, we plan to optimize our performance by driving efficiencies, simplifying organizational structures, and optimizing costs. we expect to invest some of the savings from these efforts across our businesses to be more efficient and advance our positions in personal systems and printing, while also disrupting new industries where we see attractive growth opportunities. we also plan to use some of these savings to partially offset headwinds we expect to see across our businesses in fiscal 2023 as a result of macroeconomic factors.
see "risk factors- we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business" in item 1a, which is incorporated herein by reference. for more information on our fiscal 2020 plan and fiscal 2023 plan, see note 3, "restructuring and other charges," to the consolidated financial statements in item 1 of part i of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
oracle corporation ("oracle") litigation proceeds on october 12, 2021, oracle paid approximately $4.65 billion, to satisfy the judgment with interest, related to the litigation in connection with oracle's discontinuation of software support for former hewlett-packard company's itanium-based line of mission-critical servers. the net proceeds from the judgement were shared equally between hp and hewlett packard enterprise pursuant to the terms of the separation and distribution agreement.
recent developments on august 29, 2022, we completed the acquisition of poly, a leading global provider of workplace collaboration solutions, in an all-cash transaction for $40 per share, implying a total enterprise value of $3.3 billion, inclusive of poly's net debt. poly is a leader in video conferencing solutions, cameras, headsets, voice and software. with the acquisition, we aim to deliver a complete ecosystem of devices, software, and digital services to create premium employee experiences, improve workforce productivity, and provide enterprise customers with better visibility, insights, security, and manageability across their hybrid it environments. the financial results of poly are included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended october 31, 2022, from the date of the acquisition. we expect to complete the integration of poly to hp's system and process by the end of fiscal year 2023.
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on september 1, 2022, we consummated our offer (the "exchange offer") to exchange approximately $0.5 billion of outstanding notes issued by poly (the "poly notes") for new notes issued by us with the same interest rate, interest payment dates, maturity date and redemption terms as the exchanged poly notes. in conjunction with the exchange offer, certain proposed amendments that would eliminate substantially all restrictive covenants and certain events of default and other provisions in the indenture governing poly notes were adopted, pursuant to a consent solicitation (the "consent solicitation") conducted concurrently with the exchange offer.
critical accounting policies and estimates general the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with united states ("u.s.") generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. as of october 31, 2022, the impact to our business from the changing macroeconomic factors continued to unfold. additionally, hp continues to assess and evaluate impacts from the events in russia, inflationary concerns, as well as certain supply chain disruptions. as a result, many of our estimates and assumptions required increased judgment and may carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. as events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates may change in future periods. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hp's board of directors. management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1, "overview and summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we are expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. we evaluate customers' ability to pay based on various factors like historical payment experience, financial metrics and customer credit scores.
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while many of our sales contracts contain standard terms and conditions, there are contracts which contain non-standard terms and conditions. further, many of our arrangements include multiple performance obligations. as a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including the identification of performance obligations that are distinct, the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations in the arrangement and the timing of transfer of control of promised goods or services for each of those performance obligations.
we evaluate each performance obligation in an arrangement to determine whether it represents distinct goods or services. a performance obligation constitutes distinct goods or services when the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the performance obligation is distinct within the context of the contract.
transaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. if the transaction price includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount using either the expected value or most likely amount method. we reduce the transaction price at the time of revenue recognition for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns. we use estimates to determine the expected variable consideration for such programs based on historical experience, expected consumer behavior and market conditions.
when a sales arrangement contains multiple performance obligations, such as hardware and/or services, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to their selling price. the selling price for each performance obligation is based on its standalone selling price ("ssp"). we establish ssp using the price charged for a performance obligation when hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sold separately ("observable price") and, in some instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. when observable price is not available, we establish ssp based on management's judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life-cycle. consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology industry life cycles. we may modify or develop new go-to-market practices in the future, which may result in changes in selling prices, impacting standalone selling price determination applying the aforementioned management judgments and estimates. this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement. in most arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price.
revenue is recognized when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. we generally invoice the customer upon delivery of the goods or services and the payments are due as per contract terms. for fixed-price support or maintenance and other service contracts that are in the nature of stand-ready obligations, payments are generally received in advance from customers and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the contract. in instances when revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor products or services, we record revenue on a gross basis when we are a principal in the transaction and on a net basis when we are acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor. we consider several factors to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent, most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the customer, have established our own pricing and have inventory and credit risks.
warranty we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue. we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis. our standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period. while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience. warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts, labor and onsite services, depending upon the product. if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty obligation may be required.
retirement and post-retirement benefits our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions. our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates, mortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets. the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period. mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan. the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our long-term actual experience and future expectations. the expected long-term return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset correlations and management's expected returns for each asset class. we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected long-term return on plan assets. in any fiscal year, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected long-term return on plan assets. historically, differences between the actual return and expected long-term return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation, short-term performance relative to expected long-term performance, and to a lesser extent, differences between target and actual investment allocations, the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations, and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures. for the recognition of net periodic benefit (credit) cost, the calculation of the expected long-term return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as a result of interim re-measurement.
our major assumptions vary by plan, and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in note 4, "retirement and post-retirement benefit plans" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. the following table provides the impact a change of 25 basis points in each of the weighted-average assumptions of the discount hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations rate, expected increase in compensation levels and expected long-term return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit (credit) cost for fiscal year 2022:
change in net periodic benefit cost in millions assumptions:
discount rate                                                  $7
expected increase in compensation levels                       $2
expected long-term return on plan assets                      $19
taxes on earnings as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken, income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and, in some cases, is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2029.
material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the united states, and our related future effective tax rate.
we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns. we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse.
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination. likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 60 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, and our positions may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our domestic operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions, pension and related interest. we adjust our uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit. determining the appropriate provision for potential deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could reasonably result from an audit requires management judgments and estimates, and income tax audits are inherently unpredictable. we may not accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our provision for taxes, net earnings and cash flows. for a further discussion on taxes on earnings, refer to note 6, "taxes on earnings" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence considering judgments related to future demand and market conditions. factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, ageing of inventory, technological changes, supply constraints, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues.
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business combinations we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill and may involve engaging independent third parties to perform an appraisal. when determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates. fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount. judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment may include changes in business climate, market conditions, or other events impacting the reporting unit. if we determine an impairment is more likely than not based on our qualitative assessment, a quantitative assessment of impairment is performed.
performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables. if we determine the carrying amount exceeds fair value, goodwill is impaired and the excess is recognized as an impairment loss.
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property ("ip"), commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events, pertaining to a particular case. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, we share responsibility with hewlett packard enterprise for certain matters, as discussed in note 14, "litigation and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference, and hewlett packard enterprise has agreed to indemnify us in whole or in part with respect to certain matters. based on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in note 14, "litigation and contingencies", are not a meaningful indicator of hp's potential liability. litigation is inherently unpredictable. however, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of october 31, 2022, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.
recent accounting pronouncements for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our consolidated financial statements see note 1, "overview and summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
results of operations revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our overall net revenue. as a result, our net revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect it will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we supplement the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue with the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue on a constant currency basis, which excludes the effect of foreign currency hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations exchange fluctuations calculated by translating current period revenues using monthly exchange rates from the comparative period and excluding any hedging impact recognized in the current period, and without adjusting for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. this information is provided so that net revenue can be viewed with and without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our net revenue results and trends, as management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. the constant currency measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue on a gaap basis. other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.
results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows:

net revenue in fiscal year 2022, total net revenue decreased 0.8% (increased 0.7% on a constant currency basis) as compared to the prior-year period. net revenue from the united states decreased 3.4% to $21.7 billion, and outside of the united states increased 0.6% to $41.3 billion. the decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, decline in supplies, notebooks and consumer printing, partially offset by an increase in desktops, workstations and other personal systems. the decrease was driven by unit decline, partially offset by higher average selling prices ("asps"). units were down in both personal systems and printing due to supply chain constraints, and demand softness primarily in the second half of fiscal 2022 driven by the macroeconomic environment including inflationary trends.
a detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment net revenue is included under "segment information" below.
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gross margin for fiscal year 2022, gross margin decreased by 1.5 percentage points, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts and mix shifts, higher costs including commodity costs and reduction in previously estimated sales and marketing program incentives in the prior-year period, partially offset by higher asps.
a detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment gross margins is included under "segment information" below.
operating expenses research and development ("r&d")
r&d expense decreased 16.5% in fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by increased investments in personal systems in the prior-year period, lower variable compensation and joint partner funding.
selling, general and administrative ("sg&a")
sg&a expense decreased 8.3% in fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by lower variable compensation and go-to-market initiatives expenses.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges relate primarily to the fiscal 2020 plan. for more information, see note 3, "restructuring and other charges", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
acquisition and divestiture charges acquisition and divestiture charges primarily include, direct third-party professional and legal fees, and integration and divestiture-related costs, as well as non-cash adjustments to the fair value of certain acquired assets such as inventory and certain compensation charges related to cash settlement of restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units from acquisitions. acquisition and divestiture charges increased by $250 million in the fiscal year 2022, primarily due to the poly acquisition.
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets relates primarily to intangible assets resulting from acquisitions. amortization of intangible assets increased by $74 million in the fiscal year 2022, primarily due to the recent acquisition of poly, and the acquisitions of hyperx and teradici in the fiscal year 2021.
russia exit charges for the fiscal year 2022, hp recognized a charge of $23 million towards severance, cancellation of contracts, inventory write-downs and other one-time exit charges related to our decision to wind down our operations in russia.
interest and other, net interest and other, net for the fiscal year 2022 was net expense as compared to a net gain in the fiscal year 2021, primarily due to one-time gain from oracle litigation proceeds of $2.3 billion in the prior-year period and increased interest expenses on senior unsecured notes. for more information, see note 7, "supplementary financial information", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
provision for taxes our effective tax rate was 27.9% in fiscal year 2022. the effective tax rate differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to impacts of internal reorganization and favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings in lower-tax jurisdictions throughout the world. the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented were singapore, malaysia and puerto rico.
for a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% in fiscal year 2022, and further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see note 6, "taxes on earnings" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
in fiscal year 2022, we recorded $470 million of net income tax charges related to discrete items in the provision for taxes. this amount included $649 million of tax effects related to internal reorganization, $118 million of uncertain tax position charges, $55 million related to withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings, $51 million related to audit settlements in various jurisdictions and $26 million of other net tax charges. these charges were partially offset by income tax benefits of $183 million related to the filing of tax returns in various jurisdictions, $156 million related to changes in valuation allowances, $47 million related to restructuring charges, and $43 million related to poly acquisition charges.
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on august 16, 2022, the u.s. government enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022 (the "inflation reduction act") into law. the inflation reduction act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (the "corporate amt") of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income ("afsi") of corporations with average afsi exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year period. the corporate amt is effective for the company beginning in fiscal 2024 and we have elected to treat any future corporate amt as period costs in the period they arise. additionally, the inflation reduction act imposes an excise tax of 1% tax on the fair market value of net stock repurchases made after december 31, 2022. the impact of this provision will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods. we continue to analyze the impacts of the inflation reduction act; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
segment information a description of the products and services for each segment can be found in note 2, "segment information," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the segments disclosed.

fiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021
personal systems net revenue increased 1.7% (increased 3.6% on a constant currency basis) in the fiscal year 2022, as compared to the prior-year period. the net revenue increase was primarily attributable to desktops, workstations and other, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts and a decline in notebooks. the net revenue increase was driven by 22.4% increase in asps, partially offset by 16.9% decrease in unit volume. the increase in asps was primarily due to disciplined pricing and mix shifts to premium, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts. the decrease in unit volume was primarily driven by a decline in notebooks including lower chromebook sales, partially offset by increases in desktops and workstations. in addition, units were impacted due to the overall macroeconomic environment, demand softness primarily in the second half of fiscal 2022, and supply chain constraints impacting certain parts of the product offerings.
commercial pcs revenue increased 10.5% primarily driven by higher asps and unit growth in desktops and workstations, partially offset by unit decline in notebooks due to lower chromebooks. consumer pcs net revenue decreased 12.7% driven by unit declines in notebooks, partially offset by higher asps.
consequently, net revenue increased 14.4% in desktops, 25.8% in workstations and decreased 4.4% in notebooks.
personal systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.6 percentage points, primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. the gross margin decrease was primarily due to the reduction in previously estimated sales and marketing program incentives in the prior-year period, higher costs including commodity costs, and foreign currency impacts, partially offset by disciplined pricing and mix shifts. operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.8 percentage points primarily driven by last year's increased r&d investments, lower variable compensation and joint partner funding.

printing net revenue decreased 6.1% (decreased 5.5% on a constant currency basis) for fiscal year 2022 as compared to the prior-year period. the decline in net revenue was primarily driven by a decline in supplies, consumer and unfavorable foreign currency impacts, partially offset by growth in commercial. net revenue for supplies decreased 6.9%, primarily driven by consumer demand weakness, continued normalization in home printing and the decision to wind down business operations in russia, partially offset by the gradual recovery in industrial print. printer unit volume decreased 15.4% and asps increased 10.4%. the decrease in printer unit volume was primarily driven by decreases in both consumer and commercial due to component availability and supply chain disruptions. printer asps increased primarily due to disciplined pricing and mix shifts, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts.
net revenue for commercial increased by 0.4%, primarily due to a 7.7% increase in asps, partially offset by an 8.0% decrease in printer unit volume. the increase in asps was primarily driven by disciplined pricing and mix shifts, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts.
net revenue for consumer decreased 11.3%, primarily due to a 16.5% decrease in printer unit volume, partially offset by 5.9% increase in asps. the increase in asps was primarily driven by disciplined pricing.
printing earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.2 percentage points for fiscal year 2022, primarily due to lower operating expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. the decrease in gross margin was driven by lower supplies mix, and higher commodity and supply chain costs, partially offset by disciplined pricing. further, gross margin was impacted by component shortages and supply chain disruptions which impacted mix and unit availability for both commercial and consumer. operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to lower variable compensation and go-to-market initiative expenses.
corporate investments the loss from operations in corporate investments for the fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to expenses associated with our incubation projects and investments in digital enablement.
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. we believe that current cash, cash flow from operating activities, new borrowings, available commercial paper authorization and the credit facilities will be sufficient to meet hp's operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and post-retirement funding requirements, authorized share repurchases and annual dividend payments for the foreseeable future. additionally, if suitable acquisition opportunities arise, the company may obtain all or a portion of the required financing through additional borrowings. while our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions, our access to a variety of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions. our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled "risk factors" in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" in item 7a, which are incorporated herein by reference.
during the fiscal year 2022, we completed the acquisition of poly, with a combined purchase price of $2.7 billion, net of cash acquired, of which $1.8 billion was recorded as goodwill and $1.4 billion as intangible assets and net liabilities assumed of $0.4 billion. for more information, see note 18, "acquisitions", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
on september 1, 2022, we consummated our exchange offer and consent solicitation. the approximately $0.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of our new notes mature in 2029 (the "2029 notes"), and an aggregate amount of $8 million in consent fee was paid in connection therewith. in addition, under the terms of the 2029 notes, we are obligated to, within 60 days after the consummation of our acquisition of poly, offer to purchase all or a portion of the 2029 notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.
on october 19, 2022, we commenced the change of control offer for the 2029 notes. on november 17, 2022, we consummated the change of control offer and paid an aggregate amount of approximately $498 million in connection therewith, to repurchase the approximately $488 million of notes tendered. on november 21, 2022, we issued a notice of redemption to redeem the remaining approximately $3 million of the 2029 notes.
amounts held outside of the u.s. are generally utilized to support non-u.s. liquidity needs and may from time to time be distributed to the u.s. repatriations of amounts held outside the u.s. generally will not be taxable from a u.s. federal tax perspective but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax upon repatriation. as we evaluate the future cash needs of our operations, we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries and how to utilize such funds, including reducing our gross debt level, or other uses.

key working capital metrics management utilizes current cash conversion cycle information to manage our working capital level. the table below presents the cash conversion cycle:
as of october 31
2022                                                                                               2021                      2020
days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("dso")               28                        30                        32
days of supply in inventory ("dos")                                    57                        53                        43
days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable ("dpo")           (114)                     (108)                     (105)
cash conversion cycle                                                (29)                      (25)                      (30)
the cash conversion cycle is the sum of days of dso and dos less dpo. items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from a long-term sustainable rate include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in payment terms and timing, extent of receivables factoring, macro-economic factors, seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period.
dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, by a 90-day average of net revenue. the decrease in dso as compared to prior-year period, was due to higher factoring, partially offset by unfavorable revenue linearity.
dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. the increase in dos was primarily due to lower cost of revenue and higher inventory for assurance of supply in printing, partially offset by consumption of commodities in personal systems.
dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. the increase in dpo as compared to prior-year period, was primarily due to payment timing partially offset by lower purchasing volumes.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2022 as compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to poly's acquisition, lower proceeds from sale of investments of $0.3 billion and higher investments in property, plant and equipment of $0.2 billion.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased by $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2022 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to higher proceeds from debt issuance of $2.1 billion, lower share repurchases of $2.0 billion and lower payment of debt of $0.6 billion, partially offset by commercial paper activity of $0.8 billion.
share repurchases and dividends in fiscal year 2022, hp returned total $5.3 billion to the shareholders in the form of share repurchases of $4.3 billion and cash dividends of $1.0 billion. as of october 31, 2022, hp had approximately $2.1 billion remaining under the share repurchase authorizations approved by hp's board of directors.
for more information on our share repurchases, see note 12, "stockholders' deficit", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

weighted-average interest rate             3.7    %   3.1                       %
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital and targeted capital structure.
short-term debt decreased by $0.9 billion and long-term debt increased by $4.4 billion for fiscal year 2022 as compared to prior-year period. the net increase in total debt was primarily due to issuance of unsecured senior debt amounting to $4.0 billion during the year and exchange offer of $0.5 billion related to poly notes, which was, partially offset by payment of $0.5 billion towards redemption of existing notes maturing in september 2022 and commercial paper payments of $0.4 billion.
our weighted-average interest rate reflects the effective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the effect of interest rate swaps. for more information on our interest rate swaps, see note 10, "financial instruments" in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data", which is incorporated herein by reference.
for more information on the new notes and the redemption of existing notes, see note 11, "borrowings", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
as of october 31, 2022, we maintained the 5-year sustainability-linked senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of $5.0 billion which will be available until may 26, 2026. funds borrowed under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes.
available borrowing resources as of october 31, 2022, we had available borrowing resources of $937 million from uncommitted lines of credit in addition to the revolving credit facility.
the amendment to our 2019 shelf registration statement to convert to a non-automatic shelf registration statement was declared effective by the sec on february 25, 2021 and, as of october 31, 2022, enables us to offer for sale, from time to time, in one or more offerings, $1.0 billion, in the aggregate, of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depository shares and warrants. the 2019 shelf registration statement will expire in december 2022, around which time we expect to file a new shelf registration statement.
for more information on our borrowings, see note 11, "borrowings", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
credit ratings our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information they obtain during our ongoing discussions. while we currently do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt, a downgrade from our current credit rating may increase the cost of borrowing under our credit facility, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper, require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts and may have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position, depending on the extent of such downgrade. see "risk factors- failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets" in item 1a, which is incorporated herein by reference. we can access alternative sources of funding, including drawdowns under our credit facility, if necessary, to offset potential reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper.
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
contractual and other obligations our contractual and other obligations as of october 31, 2022, were as follows:
payments due by period total                 short-term                        long-term in millions principal payments on debt(1)         $11,190                     $218                          $10,972

(1)amounts represent the principal cash payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments, discounts or premiums.
(2)amounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt. we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our u.s. dollar global notes to variable interest rates. the impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps at october 31, 2022 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on debt.
(3)purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty. purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.
(4)retirement and post-retirement benefit plan contributions. in fiscal year 2023, we expect to contribute approximately $36 million to non-u.s. pension plans, $32 million to cover benefit payments to u.s. non-qualified plan participants and $4 million to cover benefit claims for our post-retirement benefit plans. our policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution required by local government, funding and taxing authorities. expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes. for more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see note 4, "retirement and post-retirement benefit plans", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(5)cost savings plans. as a result of our approved restructuring plans, we expect to make future cash payments of approximately $0.8 billion. we expect to make future cash payments of $0.4 billion in fiscal year 2023 with remaining cash payments through fiscal year 2025. these payments have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments. for more information on our restructuring activities that are part of our cost improvements, see note 3, "restructuring and other charges", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(6)uncertain tax positions. as of october 31, 2022, we had approximately $605 million of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. for more information on our uncertain tax positions, see note 6, "taxes on earnings", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations off-balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
we have third-party short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers and hp. for more information on our third-party short-term financing arrangements, see note 7 "supplementary financial information" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

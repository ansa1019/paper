item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report. the following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed under the headings "risk factors" and "forward-looking statements."
overview our mission is to improve the lives of people with diabetes. we are primarily engaged in the development, manufacture, and sale of our proprietary omnipod system, a continuous insulin delivery system for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. the omnipod system features a small, lightweight, self-adhesive disposable tubeless omnipod device that the user fills with insulin and wears directly on the body for up to three days at a time, which delivers personalized doses of insulin, and the pdm or controller, a wireless handheld device that programs the pod with the user's personalized insulin-delivery instructions and wirelessly monitors the pod's operation.
the omnipod system, includes: classic omnipod, its next generation omnipod dash, and the most recent generation omnipod 5, all of which eliminate the need for multiple daily injections using syringes or insulin pens or the use of pump and tubing. omnipod dash features a secure bluetooth enabled pod and pdm with a color touch screen user interface supported by smartphone connectivity. omnipod 5, which builds on our omnipod dash mobile platform, is a tubeless automated insulin delivery system, that integrates with a continuous glucose monitor ("cgm") to manage blood sugar and is fully controlled by a compatible personal smartphone or omnipod 5 controller. the cgm is sold separately by a third party. in addition, substantially all of our drug delivery revenue consists of sales of pods to amgen for use in the neulasta® onpro® kit, a delivery system for amgen's neulasta to help reduce the risk of infection after intense chemotherapy.
our long-term financial objective is to sustain profitable growth. to achieve this goal, our efforts have been focused on the launch of omnipod 5, which in 2022 received fda clearance for individuals aged two years and older with type 1 diabetes. our limited market release of omnipod 5 in the united states began in the first quarter, and in the third quarter we launched our u.s. full market release. we are also working to bring omnipod 5 to our international markets. we recently received ce mark approval under the european mdr, and we are currently focused on further building our international teams and advancing our regulatory, reimbursement, and market development efforts. we plan to launch omnipod 5 in the u.k. and germany in 2023 and to continue our international roll out more broadly in 2024.
in 2022, we completed our omnipod 5 type 2 diabetes feasibility study and plan to begin a pivotal trial in 2023 with the goal of expanding omnipod 5's indication to type 2 users. additionally, to accelerate our efforts to secure reimbursement for omnipod 5, we have fully enrolled individuals in a randomized control trial in the u.s. and enrollment will begin soon in france. we also continue to expand market access and awareness of omnipod through our direct to consumer advertising programs and through growing our presence in the u.s. pharmacy channel, where access to omnipod 5 and omnipod dash is simpler and affordable, as no up-front investment is required. as we continue our growth in the pharmacy channel, we plan to phase-out our classic omnipod in the u.s. in 2023, since the vast majority of our customer base is no longer using this product.
additionally, we continue to increase our presence within our existing markets and expand internationally in a targeted and strategic manner. we opened an office in dubai to serve as our primary local presence and regional infrastructure in the middle east, launched omnipod in saudi arabia, and expanded into the united arab emirates.
we have also been taking steps to continue strengthening our global manufacturing capabilities. we are optimizing our operations in china by consolidating our production in that region into one location. further, in 2022 we broke ground on a new manufacturing plant in malaysia to support our international expansion strategy, further ensure product supply, and drive higher gross margins over time. we expect to begin production at this new manufacturing facility in 2024.
finally, we continue to focus on our product development efforts, including aid offerings, such as choice of continuous glucose monitor and smartphone integration, and enhancing the customer experience through digital product and data capabilities. we have also developed a basal-only pod for individuals with type 2 diabetes and submitted our 510(k) application to the fda in november. we expect commercialization of the basal-only pod in 2024.
results of operations the discussion of our results of operations for 2020 has been omitted from this form 10-k but can be found in item 7. management's discussion and analysis and results of operations in our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021 filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 24, 2022.
factors affecting operating results our pods are intended to be used continuously for up to three days and then be replaced with a new disposable pod. we recently achieved a milestone of 360,000 estimated global customers using omnipod, including over 100,000 u.s. customers using the omnipod 5. as we grow our customer base, we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenues through recurring sales of our disposable pods, which provides recurring revenue. our recurring revenue business model, alongside the omnipod system's unique patented design enables us to provide pump therapy at a low or no up-front investment in regions where reimbursement allows for it. our pay-as-you-go pricing model also reduces the risk to third-party payors.
during 2022, we issued two voluntary mdcs, one in october for our omnipod dash pdm related to its battery and the other in november for our omnipod 5 controller related to the charging port and cable. in addition to the estimated liability we recorded in 2022, we have a performance obligation to replace omnipod dash pdms and omnipod 5 controllers sold subsequent to the mdc issuances, which is expected to negatively impact gross margins and net income in 2023, most notably in the first half of the year.
we have also experienced and expect to continue to experience challenges stemming from the global supply chain disruption that began during the coronavirus pandemic ("covid-19"); however, to date we have been able to successfully mitigate this disruption and ensure uninterrupted supply to our customers by increasing our inventory levels and taking other measures. while our mitigation efforts and inflation have and are expected to continue to negatively impact gross margins and net income in 2023, we intend to continue to work to improve productivity to help offset these costs.

(1) constant currency revenue growth is a non-gaap financial measure which should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with gaap. see "management's use of non-gaap measures."
total revenue for 2022 increased $206.5 million, or 18.8%, to $1,305.3 million, compared with $1,098.8 million in 2021. constant currency revenue growth of 22.2% was primarily driven by higher volume and, to a lesser extent, favorable sales channel mix.
u.s. omnipod u.s. omnipod revenue for 2022 increased $233.3 million, or 35.8%, to $884.8 million, compared with $651.5 million in 2021. this increase was primarily due to higher omnipod 5 and omnipod dash volumes driven by growing our customer base and, to a lesser extent, growth through the pharmacy channel, where pods have a higher average selling price due in part to the fact that we offer the pdm/controller for no charge. existing customer conversions to omnipod 5 also contributed to the revenue increase as some users fill both their starter kit and their first month of refills simultaneously.
u.s. omnipod revenue for 2022 includes $249.9 million of related party revenue, compared with $58.2 million in 2021. the $191.7 million increase primarily resulted from a shift in certain revenues from one distributor to another as we worked to extend our reach through the pharmacy channel. additional information regarding our related party transactions is provided in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
in 2023, we expect strong omnipod revenue growth driven by continued volume growth of omnipod 5 in the pharmacy channel, continued adoption of omnipod dash, and the benefits of our recurring revenue model.
international omnipod international omnipod revenue for 2022 increased $3.1 million, or 0.9%, to $363.0 million, compared with $359.9 million in 2021. excluding the 11.2% unfavorable impact of currency exchange, the remaining 12.1% increase was primarily due to higher volumes as we continue to expand awareness and access to omnipod dash, partially offset by increased competition from aid systems. in 2023, we expect higher international omnipod revenue due to continued volume growth driven by the ongoing adoption of omnipod dash, partially offset by competition from aid systems and an unfavorable impact of currency exchange.
drug delivery drug delivery revenue for 2022 decreased $29.9 million, or 34.2%, to $57.5 million, compared with $87.4 million in 2021. this decrease was primarily driven by a decline in production volume due to lower demand from our partner. in 2023, we expect drug delivery revenue to decline due to a lower demand forecast from our partner.

cost of revenue cost of revenue for 2022 increased $153.0 million, or 44.1%, to $499.7 million, compared with $346.7 million in 2021. gross margin was 61.7% in 2022, compared with 68.4% in 2021. the 6.7 point decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by a $57.9 million net charge, or 4.5 points, associated with the voluntary mdcs we issued in 2022. the decrease was also driven by higher expected production costs in the u.s. as manufacturing continues to ramp and become a larger portion of our total production and higher costs associated with omnipod 5 production. these decreases were partially offset by higher average selling price due to growth in the pharmacy channel, where pods have a higher average selling price due in part to the fact that we offer the pdm/controller for no charge.
we expect gross margin for 2023 to be in the range of 65% to 66%. we anticipate gross margin to increase due to significant costs associated with the mdcs in 2022, most of which we do not expect to recur in 2023 and higher volume in the pharmacy channel and favorable geographical sales mix. we believe these increases will be partially offset by continued higher production costs as we further scale u.s. manufacturing, unfavorable product line mix due to higher costs associated with omnipod 5 production, and higher costs as we contend with inflation.
research and development research and development expenses for 2022 increased $20.1 million, or 12.6%, to $180.2 million, compared with $160.1 million in 2021. this increase was primarily due to year-over-year headcount additions to support our continued investment in development of omnipod products, partially offset by lower outside services used for clinical activities. we expect research and development spending in 2023 to increase compared with 2022 as we continue to invest in advancing our innovation and clinical pipeline and contend with inflation.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses for 2022 increased $121.8 million, or 26.1%, to $587.8 million, compared with $466.0 million in 2021. this increase was primarily attributable to year-over-year headcount additions, mainly to support information technology and commercial operations and $25.2 million of legal charges related to the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit, associated legal fees, and the settlement of a contract dispute. to a lesser extent, these increases were due to an increase in investments to expand market acceptance and access to omnipod, higher travel and entertainment expenses due to increased activity as covid-19 restrictions have lifted, an increase in software license fees driven by investments in new systems to support our growing business and headcount additions, and higher amortization of cloud computing implementation costs. additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses include $3.4 million of costs associated with the retirement and advisory services of our former chief executive officer. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in direct-to-consumer advertising resulting from the timing of spend.
we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2023 compared with 2022 due to investments in our operating structure to facilitate operational efficiencies and continued growth, including customer support and a new enterprise resource planning system. additionally, we plan to make investments to support the omnipod system, including market acceptance and access, and the phased launch of omnipod 5 in our international markets.
non-operating items interest expense, net interest expense, net for 2022 decreased $34.5 million, or 56.4%, to $26.7 million, compared with $61.2 million in 2021. this decrease was primarily driven by the adoption of accounting standards update 2020-06, accounting for convertible debt instruments and contracts in an entity's own equity ("asu 2020-06"), which eliminated most of the non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes. refer to recently adopted accounting standard in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
loss on extinguishment of debt during 2021, we incurred a $42.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase and conversion of all of our outstanding 1.375% notes. refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other expense, net other expense, net for 2022 decreased $0.8 million to $1.1 million, compared with $1.9 million in 2021. the decrease was primarily driven by an increase in unrealized foreign currency gains, which was partially offset by realized foreign currency losses.
income tax expense income tax expense was $5.2 million on pre-tax income of $9.8 million for 2022 and $3.7 million on pre-tax income of $20.5 million for 2021. our effective tax rate was 53.4% and 18.2% for 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by a decrease in pre-tax income in the u.s. where we have net operating loss carryforwards to reduce taxable profits and a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. refer to note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our income tax expense.

non-gaap financial measures management uses the following non-gaap financial measures:
constant currency revenue growth represents the change in revenue between current and prior year periods using the exchange rate in effect during the applicable prior year period. we present constant currency revenue growth because we believe it provides meaningful information regarding our results on a consistent and comparable basis. management uses this non-gaap financial measure, in addition to financial measures in accordance with gaap, to evaluate our operating results. it is also one of the performance metrics that determines management incentive compensation.
adjusted ebitda represents net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and other significant transactions or events, such as legal settlements, medical device corrections, and loss on extinguishment of debt, that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performances, as applicable. we present adjusted ebitda because management uses it as a supplemental measure in assessing our operating performance, and we believe that it is helpful to investors, and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period. adjusted ebitda is a commonly used measure in determining business value and we use it internally to report results.
these non-gaap financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, the above definitions may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. non-gaap financial measures exclude the effect of items that increase or decrease our reported results of operations; accordingly, we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety.

the increase in debt and the decrease in stockholders' equity was primarily due to the adoption of asu 2020-06. refer to recently adopted accounting standard in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
convertible debt to finance our operations and global expansion, we have periodically issued convertible senior notes, which are convertible into our common stock. as of december 31, 2022, the following notes were outstanding:
issuance date        coupon         principal outstanding         due date                         conversion rate(1)         conversion price

(1) per $1,000 face value of notes.
in connection with the issuance of the 0.375% convertible senior notes ("0.375% notes"), we purchased capped call options ("capped calls") on our common stock. by entering into the capped calls, we expect to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock (or, in the event the conversion is settled in cash, to provide a source of cash to settle a portion of our cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion our stock price exceeds the conversion price under the 0.375% notes. the capped calls have an initial strike price of $335.90 per share and cover 3.5 million shares of our common stock.
credit agreement we have a $100 million three-year senior secured revolving credit facility ("revolving credit facility"), which expires in 2024. at december 31, 2022, no amount was outstanding under the revolving credit facility. the revolving credit facility contains a covenant to maintain a specified leverage ratio under certain conditions when there are amounts outstanding under the facility.
it also contains other customary covenants, none of which are considered restrictive to our operations. additionally, we have a seven year term loan, which matures in 2028, that contains covenants restricting or limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make asset dispositions, create or permit liens, sell, transfer or exchange assets, guarantee certain indebtedness, and make acquisitions and other investments. additional information regarding our debt is provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
we believe that our current liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected operating, investing, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of $119.0 million in 2022 was primarily attributable to net income, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a $2.5 million working capital cash outflow. the working capital outflow was driven by a $36.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, a $51.8 million increase in accounts receivable, and a $49.1 million increase in inventories, partially offset by a $137.6 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily driven by an increase in cloud computing implementation costs. the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in sales in the u.s. pharmacy channel, which has longer payment terms, partially offset by a decrease in unbilled accounts receivable related to lower production volumes of our drug delivery product. the increase in inventories was primarily driven by a planned inventory build to satisfy demand. finally, the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily driven by the voluntary mdcs issued for our omnipod dash pdms and omnipod 5 controllers, an increase in rebates due to growth in the pharmacy channel and an increase in compensation costs due to higher incentive compensation achievement and head count additions.
net cash used in operating activities of $68.1 million in 2021 was primarily attributable to net income, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, non-cash interest, and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a $263.6 million working capital cash outflow. the working capital outflow was driven by a $154.4 million increase in inventories, a $71.3 million increase in accounts receivable and a $46.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by a $24.4 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. the increase in inventories was primarily driven by a planned inventory build to satisfy demand and the addition of our third highly automated manufacturing line. the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in sales in the u,s. pharmacy channel, which has longer payment terms. the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily driven by an increase in cloud computing implementation costs. finally, the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in rebates due to growth in the pharmacy channel and higher compensation costs due to an increase in both incentive compensation achievement and head count.
investing activities we had $191.1 million of net cash used in investing activities in 2022, compared with $82.7 million in 2021.
capital spending-capital expenditures were $122.9 million and $111.9 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and primarily related to the purchase of equipment to increase our manufacturing capacity. we expect capital expenditures for 2023 to decrease compared with 2022 given our significant investments to build capacity in 2022, including acceleration of some of our spending on machinery and equipment for our new malaysia manufacturing facility that is under construction. we expect to fund our capital expenditures using existing cash.
investments in developed software-investments in developed software were $12.9 million and $10.8 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and primarily related to investments in projects to support our cloud-based capabilities.
acquisitions and investments-in 2022, we paid $26.0 million to acquire substantially all the assets related to the manufacture and production of shape-memory alloy wire assemblies that are used in the production of omnipods from dynalloy, inc. and $21.5 million to acquire developed technology and patents from agc. in addition we paid $7.8 million for strategic investments in two private companies.
sales of marketable securities-the $40.0 million decrease in cash receipts from maturities of marketable securities in 2021 was driven by the prior year shift of a portion of our investment portfolio to investments that are classified as cash equivalents.
financing activities we had $40.3 million of net cash used in financing activities in 2022, compared with $40.7 million of net cash provided by financing activities in 2021.
debt issuance and repayment-during 2022, we made $24.5 million in aggregate principal payments on our equipment financings, mortgage, and term loan, compared with $22.3 million in 2021. the $2.2 million increase is due to entering the term loan and an additional equipment financing in the second and third quarters of 2021, respectively. during 2021, we received net proceeds of $489.5 million from the issuance of the term loan and used $460.9 million of cash to partially fund the repurchase of a portion of our 1.375% notes. we also received net proceeds of $43.1 million from the equipment financing transaction entered into in 2021.
prepayments of finance lease obligation-during 2022, we made $15.3 million in upfront payments upon entering into an agreement to acquire real estate in malaysia. refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this lease.
option exercises and employee stock purchase plan proceeds-total proceeds from option exercises and issuance of employee stock purchase plan shares were $16.3 million and $23.5 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the $7.2 million decrease was primarily driven by option exercises in the prior year by our former chief executive officer who retired in 2018.
payment of taxes for restricted stock net settlements-payments for taxes related to net restricted and performance stock unit settlements were $16.8 million and $28.2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the $11.4 million decrease was primarily driven by vesting of performance stock units in the prior year by our former chief executive officer who retired in 2018.

(1)interest on debt and lease obligations are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of december 31, 2022. certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates. additional information regarding our leases is provided in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
(2)excludes the impact of the interest rate swaps discussed in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
(3)purchase obligations include commitments for the purchase of omnipod system components, commitments related to establishing additional manufacturing capabilities, and other commitments for purchases of goods or services in the normal course of business. these commitments are derived from purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2022, we had various letters of credit totaling $18.6 million. during 2022, the company entered into a $20 million uncommitted letter of credit facility. in conjunction with the execution of an agreement to acquire real estate in malaysia, including land and building, a letter of credit of $17.2 million was issued under this facility to backstop a bank guarantee for the same amount. the bank guarantee serves as security for the building while under construction. additional information regarding our letters of credit is provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. the following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of the promised products in an amount that reflects the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled. we sell products both through distributors, who resell the products to consumers, and directly to consumers. transaction price is typically based on contracted rates less any estimates of claim denials and historical reimbursement experience, guidelines and payor mix, and less estimated variable consideration adjustments, including rebates. recognizing revenue requires us to exercise judgment and use estimates that can have a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue we report. we exercise significant judgment when we determine variable consideration adjustments. the amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is included in revenue only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. we estimate reductions to our revenues for rebates paid to distributors in the united states and canada and pharmacy benefit managers ("pbm") in the united states. rebates are based on contractual arrangements, which may vary. our estimates are based on products sold, historical experience, trends, specific known market events and, as available, channel inventory data. rebates charged against gross sales amounted to $247.1 million, $143.3 million and $82.5 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. provisions for rebates, sales discounts, and returns are accounted for as a reduction of sales when revenue is recognized and are included within accounts receivable trade or accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, based upon the recipient of the rebate. if the actual amounts of consideration that we receive differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates, which affects reported revenue in the period that such variances become known.
our drug delivery product line includes sales of a modified version of the omnipod to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who use our technology as a delivery method for their drugs. revenue from the drug delivery product was $57.5 million for 2022. revenue for this product line is recognized as the product is produced. accounting for drug delivery revenue requires us to select a method to measure progress towards the satisfaction of the performance obligation. this election of the most meaningful measure of progress by which to recognize drug delivery revenue requires the application of judgment. we elected the input method and selected a blend of cost and time to produce as the measure of progress. accordingly, revenue is recognized over time using a blend of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion and time incurred to date relative to total production time to measure progress toward the satisfaction of our performance obligations. we believe that both incurred cost and elapsed time reflect the value generated, which best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. contract costs include third-party costs as well as an allocation of manufacturing overhead. changes from quarter to quarter in quantity and stage of production of in-process inventory could have a significant quarterly impact on revenue.
product warranty we provide a four-year warranty on our pdms and controllers sold in the united states and europe and a five-year warranty on pdms sold in canada. in addition, we may replace pods that do not function in accordance with product specifications. we estimate our warranty obligation at the time the product is shipped based on historical experience and the estimated cost to service the claims, which include the current product cost, reclaim costs, shipping and handling costs and direct and incremental distribution and customer service support costs. since we continue to introduce new products and versions, the anticipated performance of the product over the warranty period is also considered in estimating warranty reserves. changes to the actual replacement rates, which are evaluated quarterly, could have a material impact on our estimated warranty reserve.
in 2022, we issued voluntary mdcs for the omnipod dash pdm and the omnipod 5 controller and accrued an associated warranty reserve of $68.9 million, which was subsequently reduced by $11.0 million primarily due to significantly fewer customers requesting a replacement omnipod dash pdm prior to our updated pdm being available. the remaining $54.6 million warranty reserve at december 31, 2022 includes an estimate regarding the number of:
•customers expected to request a replacement omnipod 5 controller;
•pdms/controllers that will be distributed by third parties and the cost of distribution assistance outside the u.s.;
•additional customer support personnel, their cost and the length of time they will be needed; and
•old pdms expected to be returned for disposal and the cost of reclaim changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our estimated warranty reserve related to the mdcs.
intangible assets certain of our intangible assets have been acquired through business combinations or asset purchases that include multiple components, both of which have required us to perform valuations. our valuations involve assumptions, including, revenue and/or revenue growth rates associated with acquired assets, customer attrition rates, discount rate rates, royalty rates, tax rates, expected product development plans, product lifecycles, and obsolescence.
in 2022, we entered into an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which we made a one-time payment of $25.0 million for the acquisition of technology and patents and the release of future obligations to agc, including any future royalty obligations. this amount, together with transaction costs, was allocated between the assets acquired and the settlement component based on estimated relative fair value. the valuation of these intangible assets included assumptions based on future revenues, royalty rates, and obsolescence curves related to our omnipod 5 product. in addition, since certain of the intangible assets were classified as defensive assets, the valuation included an assumption related to the probability that a claim made by insulet would be successful. as a result of the relative fair value allocation, values of $12.0 million and $9.5 million were assigned to acquired technology and patents, respectively, and the settlement component was estimated to have a value of $3.6 million. changes in these assumptions could impact the values assigned to the intangible assets acquired and, accordingly have a material impact on the amount attributed to the settlement component in our results of operations.
inventory reserves we reduce the carrying value of inventories for items that are potentially excess, obsolete, or slow-moving based on changes in customer demand, technology developments, or other economic factors in order to state inventories at net realizable value. factors influencing these adjustments include inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. during 2022, we charged $8.4 million to the consolidated statement of operations for excess and obsolete inventory, including $4.8 million related to the phase-out of classic omnipod. the determination of this charge involved assumptions regarding the number of pdms expected to be utilized to satisfy warranty claims during the phase-out period and the length of time we will continue to offer classic omnipod outside the united states.

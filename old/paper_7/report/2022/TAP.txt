management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") in this annual report on form 10-k is provided to assist in understanding our company, operations and current business environment and should be considered a supplement to, and read in conjunction with, the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes included within part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, as well as the discussion of our business and related risk factors in part i-item 1 business and part i-item 1a risk factors, respectively. see also "cautionary statement pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995."
a discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2021 compared to 2020 has been omitted from this report, but may be found in part ii, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our fiscal 2021 form 10-k, filed with the sec on february 23, 2022, which is available free of charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov and our corporate website at www.molsoncoors.com.
changes to our consolidated results of operations as of december 31, 2022, we modified our presentation of the consolidated statements of operations to replace the former "special items, net" line item with "other operating income (expense), net." in addition, goodwill impairment, which had previously been included in "special items, net" has been reclassified to a separate line titled "goodwill impairment." the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020 were reclassified to reflect this change in presentation only.
our fiscal year unless otherwise indicated, (a) all $ amounts are in usd, (b) comparisons are to comparable prior periods and (c) 2022, 2021 and 2020 refers to the 12 months ended december 31, 2022, december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, respectively.
items affecting reported results items affecting consolidated results of operations cost inflation we continued to experience significant cost inflation, including higher material, transportation and energy costs, which negatively impacted our results of operations during the year ended december 31, 2022. while cost inflation was high in all of our markets during the year ended december 31, 2022, the impact to cogs on a percentage basis was higher for our emea&apac segment than our americas segment. in addition, consumers in certain markets in our emea&apac segment were impacted by local inflation leading to a reduction in their discretionary purchases. we expect cost inflation to continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations in 2023.
in addition to the cost increases that commenced in the second half of 2021, the russian invasion of ukraine in february 2022 caused and continues to cause a negative impact on the global economy, driving further increases to, among other things, the cost of transportation, energy and materials. higher transportation costs are a result of increased fuel prices, a short supply of truck drivers worldwide and increased freight costs. in the americas, we are taking steps to reduce the impact by shipping more beverages via rail to decrease the impacts of higher freight costs. in emea&apac, we are taking steps to find alternative fuel and energy sources to reduce the potential impact of the loss or disruption of the energy sources or suppliers in europe due to supply shortages as a result of the russia-ukraine conflict. we have established a governance regime to continually monitor this situation. alternative sources of fuel have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented throughout our operations in the u.k. we have increased fuel stock levels where feasible and we have been drawing on new gas pipelines and fuel sources in the baltics, bulgaria-greece, north sea and norway. we are also experiencing increased materials costs due to overall cost inflation. specifically, the volatility of aluminum prices, inclusive of midwest premium and tariffs, continued to significantly impact our results for the year ended december 31, 2022.
to the extent materials, transportation and energy prices continue to fluctuate, and if we are unable to mitigate the impact of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures through price increases or other measures, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted. even if we are able to raise the prices of our products, consumers might react negatively to such price increases, which could have a material adverse effect on, among other things, our brand, reputation and sales. if our competitors maintain or substantially lower their prices, we may lose customers or mark down prices to match them. our profitability may be impacted by prices that do not offset the inflationary pressures, which may impact gross margins. in addition, even if we increase the prices of our products in response to increases in the cost of commodities or other cost increases, we may not be able to sustain our price increases or customers may trade down to cheaper alternatives.
we continue to monitor these risks and rely on our risk management hedging program, increased pricing to our customers, our premiumization strategy and cost savings programs to help mitigate some of the inflationary pressures.
coronavirus global pandemic we have been actively monitoring the impact of the coronavirus pandemic since it started at the end of the first quarter of 2020. we observed improvements in the marketplace related to the coronavirus global pandemic as on-premise locations began to re-open, with varying degrees of restrictions, across the world beginning in the second quarter of 2021. a new variant of coronavirus, omicron, created additional uncertainty and negatively impacted our on-premise business at the end of 2021 and into the first quarter of 2022 when we started to see progressive improvements in our on-premise channel. thus, while an improvement from 2021, the coronavirus global pandemic continued to have a negative impact to our financial results for the year ended december 31, 2022. however, the margin impact of the coronavirus pandemic improved during the year ended december 31, 2022 when compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of the progressive improvements in the on-premise channel.
the extent to which our operations will continue to be impacted by the coronavirus pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including, but not limited to, the level of governmental or societal orders or restrictions on public gatherings and on-premise venues including any vaccine mandates or testing requirements, the severity and duration of the coronavirus pandemic by market including continued or prolonged future outbreaks of variants, changes in consumer behavior, the rate of vaccination and the efficacy of vaccines against coronavirus and related variants. we continue to actively monitor the ongoing evolution of the coronavirus pandemic and resulting impacts to our business.
cybersecurity incident during march 2021, we experienced a systems outage that was caused by a cybersecurity incident. we engaged leading forensic information technology firms and legal counsel to assist our investigation into the incident and we restored our systems as quickly as possible. despite these actions, we experienced delays and disruptions to our business, including brewery operations, production and shipments. this incident caused a shift in production and shipments from the first quarter of 2021 to the balance of fiscal year 2021.
revitalization plan on october 28, 2019, we initiated a revitalization plan designed to allow us to invest across our portfolio to drive long-term, sustainable growth. the revitalization plan established chicago, illinois as our americas segment operational headquarters. we closed our office in denver, colorado and consolidated certain administrative functions into our other existing office locations. as of january 1, 2020, we changed our name to molson coors beverage company and changed our management structure to two segments - americas and emea&apac. we began to incur charges during the fourth quarter of 2019 and we recognized severance and retention charges related to these restructuring activities of $4.0 million and $35.6 million during the years ended december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, respectively. as of the year ended december 31, 2021, the revitalization plan restructuring charges were substantially complete. there were no material changes to our restructuring activities since december 31, 2021.
see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 17, "other operating income (expense), net" and note 6, "goodwill and intangibles" for further discussion of the impacts of this plan.
premiumization of our portfolio in 2021, in order to support the overall premiumization of our portfolio, we strategically de-prioritized and rationalized certain non-core skus predominantly in the economy segment. while we rationalized certain non-core economy skus, we retained key economy brands allowing us to maintain a portfolio for all socio-economic demographics. we believe the premiumization of our portfolio will drive sustainable net sales and earnings growth but result in potential volume declines due to the rationalization of certain skus and as the portfolio mix shifts towards a higher composition of above premium products.
items affecting americas segment results of operations goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a partial goodwill impairment charge of $845.0 million related to the americas reporting unit as a result of the annual goodwill impairment analysis. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 6, "goodwill and intangible assets" for further information.
montreal/longueuil, québec brewery and distribution centers labor strike from late march 2022 until june 2022, approximately 400 unionized employees in our montreal/longueuil, québec brewery and distribution centers went on strike which adversely affected our business and operations. over the course of the third quarter of 2022, we recovered from the strike by rebuilding inventory and replenishing our retailers' shelves. as the brewery had not yet fully recovered until the end of the third quarter, results for the second and third quarters of 2022 were adversely impacted by this strike.
keystone litigation during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded an accrued liability of $56.6 million within mg&a related to probable losses as a result of the ongoing keystone litigation case including associated interest. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 13, "commitments and contingencies" for further information.
impairment of an asset group during the first quarter of 2022, we recognized an impairment loss of $28.6 million related to the truss joint venture asset group within other operating income (expense), net, of which $12.1 million was attributable to the noncontrolling interest. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 17, "other operating income (expense), net" for further information.
texas storm in february 2021, a winter ice storm severely impacted the southern u.s. in particular, local government authorities in texas were forced to impose energy restrictions, causing the fort worth brewery to be offline which resulted in our inability to produce or ship product during the downtime.
irwindale, california brewery sale following management approval in december 2019, in january 2020, we announced plans to cease production at our irwindale, california brewery and entered into an option agreement with pabst, granting pabst an option to purchase our irwindale, california brewery, including plant equipment and machinery and the underlying land for $150 million, subject to adjustment as further specified in the option agreement. pursuant to the option agreement, on may 4, 2020, pabst exercised its option to purchase the irwindale brewery and the purchase was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. production at the irwindale brewery ceased during the third quarter of 2020. we recorded charges related to the irwindale brewery closure as further discussed in part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 17, "other operating income (expense), net"
items affecting emea&apac segment results of operations russia-ukraine conflict in february 2022, russia invaded ukraine and the conflict remains ongoing. as a result, we suspended exports of all our brands to russia and subsequently terminated the license to produce any of our brands in russia. out of an abundance of caution, at the commencement of the conflict, production and sales of our brands in ukraine under license arrangements were halted as a result of the dangerous environment in the country due to the conflict. we anticipate entering into a new license contract within ukraine in early 2023. until then, we plan to export to ukraine from the czech republic. we had less than 0.2% of our 2021 consolidated net sales, less than 1% of our 2021 emea&apac net sales and no physical assets in russia and ukraine before the conflict began. while not material to our company, the russia-ukraine conflict negatively impacted our net sales for the year ended december 31, 2022. in addition, the russia-ukraine conflict has caused a negative impact to the global economy which has impacted our company, driving further increases to the cost of materials, transportation and energy. see the risk factor related to this conflict at part i.-item 1a. "risk factors".
fiscal year 2020 goodwill impairment in fiscal year 2020, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to our emea&apac reporting unit of $1,484.3 million as a result of the annual goodwill impairment analysis. consequently, the emea&apac reporting unit was fully impaired as of december 31, 2020.
india impairment & sale during the third quarter of 2020, we recognized an impairment loss of $30.0 million within other operating income (expense), net related to the held for sale classification of a disposal group within our india business, representing an insignificant part of our emea&apac segment. the sale of the india business disposal group was subsequently completed during the first quarter of 2021.
during the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized an impairment loss of $13.5 million within other operating income (expense), net related to the held for sale classification of the remaining portion of our india business. the sale of the remaining portion of our india business was subsequently completed during the first quarter of 2022 and resulted in an insignificant loss on disposal recorded in other operating income (expense), net.

n/m = not meaningful foreign currency impacts on results for the year ended december 31, 2022, foreign currency movements had the following impacts on our usd consolidated results:
•net sales - unfavorable impact of $298.0 million (unfavorable impact for emea&apac and americas of $249.0 million and $49.0 million, respectively).
•cost of goods sold - favorable impact of $211.7 million (favorable impact for emea&apac, americas and unallocated of $169.4 million, $36.3 million and $6.0 million, respectively).
•mg&a - favorable impact of $83.4 million (favorable impact for emea&apac and americas of $66.8 million and $16.6 million, respectively).
•income (loss) before income taxes - unfavorable impact of $15.1 million (unfavorable impact for emea&apac and americas of $14.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively, partially offset by the favorable impact for unallocated of $1.5 million).
the impacts of foreign currency movements on our consolidated usd results described above for the year ended december 31, 2022 were primarily due to the strength of the usd as compared to the gbp and cad.
included in these amounts are both translational and transactional impacts of changes in foreign exchange rates. the impact of transactional foreign currency gains and losses is recorded within other non-operating income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.
volume financial volume represents owned or actively managed brands sold to unrelated external customers within our geographic markets (net of returns and allowances), as well as contract brewing, wholesale/factored non-owned volume and company-owned distribution volume. this metric is presented on a stw basis to reflect the sales from our operations to our direct customers, generally distributors. we believe this metric is important and useful for investors and management because it gives an indication of the amount of beer and adjacent products that we have produced and shipped to customers. this metric excludes royalty volume, which consists of our brands produced and sold under various license and contract brewing agreements. factored volume in our emea&apac segment is the distribution of beer, wine, spirits and other products owned and produced by other companies to the on-premise channel, which is a common arrangement in the u.k.
as part of the revitalization plan strategy to grow our above premium portfolio and expand beyond the beer aisle, in late 2021 we de-prioritized and rationalized certain non-core skus, predominantly in the economy segment. this strategy was intended to drive sustainable net sales growth and earnings growth, despite potential volume declines due to the rationalization or certain skus and as the portfolio mix shifted toward a higher composition of above premium products.

net sales per hectoliter on a financial volume basis in local currency increased 9.3% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to prior year, primarily due to positive net pricing and favorable sales mix driven by portfolio premiumization and favorable channel mix.
financial volumes declined 2.1% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to prior year, primarily due to industry softness in the americas, cycling the rebuild of u.s. distributor inventory levels in the prior year, and the impacts of the québec labor strike, partially offset by growth in western europe due to less onerous coronavirus pandemic restrictions.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold per hectoliter in local currency increased 19.0% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to prior year, primarily due to changes in our unrealized mark-to-market commodity positions which accounted for approximately 40% of the increase and is recorded as unallocated. in addition, the increase was also impacted by cost inflation, mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs, mix impacts from portfolio premiumization, higher factored volumes and volume deleverage, partially offset by lower depreciation expense and cost savings programs.
marketing, general and administrative expenses mg&a increased 2.5% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to prior year, primarily due to the cycling of lower people-related costs in the prior year and the recording of a $56.6 million accrued liability related to potential losses as a result of the ongoing keystone litigation case including associated interest, partially offset by favorable impacts from foreign currency movements and reductions in marketing spend on non-core and discontinued brands.

total non-operating income (expense), net total non-operating expense, net increased 2.1% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to prior year primarily due to higher pension and opeb non-service costs and unfavorable transactional impacts of changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower interest expense driven by the repayment of debt as a result of our continued deleveraging actions.

the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the impact of (i) the $845 million partial goodwill impairment, recorded within our americas segment in the fourth quarter of 2022, which related to goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, and (ii) $18 million of tax expense recognized in 2021, which related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities following an announced corporate income tax rate increase in the u.k. from 19% to 25%. these decreases to the effective tax rate were partially offset by the release of $73 million of reserves for unrecognized tax positions as a result of an effective settlement reached on a tax audit during 2021.
our tax rate can be volatile and may change with, among other things, the amount and source of pre-tax income or loss, our ability to utilize foreign tax credits, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from share-based compensation, changes in tax laws and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions as statutes of limitations expire, positions are effectively settled or when additional information becomes available. there are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions and other changes to regulatory environments in countries in which we do business that, if enacted, could have an impact on our effective tax rate.
on august 16, 2022, the inflation reduction act of 2022 ("ira") was signed into u.s. law. the ira includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income ("afsi") of corporations with average afsi exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year period. the alternative minimum tax is effective for the company beginning in fiscal year 2023, and any impact to our consolidated financial statements, including cash flow, tax expense and effective tax rate, will depend on several factors, most specifically our afsi and any future administrative guidance. additionally, the ira imposes an excise tax of 1% on stock repurchases, effective january 1, 2023. the impact of this excise tax will be dependent on the extent of our share repurchases in future periods. while we continue to evaluate the new tax law, we do not believe it will have a material impact to the company in the near future.
refer to part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 12, "income tax" for additional details regarding our effective tax rate.
cost savings initiatives our next generation cost savings program, which began in 2020, delivered $605 million of cost savings over the three year program, which ended december 31 2022. the program was focused on building our capabilities and reorganizing to support our commercial revitalization strategy. total cost savings delivered in 2022, 2021 and 2020 totaled approximately $115 million, $220 million and $270 million, respectively.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased 12.9% for the year ended december 31, 2022, primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated during the year, favorable impacts from foreign currency movements and a decrease in accelerated depreciation expense recorded as a result of certain facility closures.

net sales and volume net sales per hectoliter on a financial volume basis in local currency increased 15.7% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to prior year, primarily due to favorable sales mix, in part due to the cycling of significant on-premise restrictions that occurred during the first and last quarters of 2021, particularly in the u.k, and positive net pricing.
financial volumes increased 8.1% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to prior year, primarily due to growth in our above premium portfolio and our core brands, including the cycling of significant on-premise restrictions that occurred during the first and last quarters of 2021, particularly in the u.k. and higher factored volumes.
income (loss) before income taxes income (loss) before income taxes increased 85.4% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to prior year, primarily due to higher financial volumes, favorable sales mix and positive net pricing, partially offset by cost inflation, mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs, as well as higher mg&a spend. higher mg&a spend was primarily due to cost inflation, higher incentive compensation, higher marketing spend to support our brands and the cycling of lower spend in the prior year due to cost mitigation efforts as a result of the pandemic.
unallocated segment we have certain activity that is not allocated to our segments and primarily includes financing-related costs such as interest expense and income, foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances related to financing and other treasury-related activities, and the unrealized changes in fair value on our commodity swaps not designated in hedging relationships. additionally, only the service cost component of net periodic pension and opeb cost is reported within each operating segment, and all other components remain unallocated.

liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview our primary sources of liquidity include cash provided by operating activities and access to external capital. we continue to monitor world events which may create credit or economic challenges that could adversely impact our profit or operating cash flows and our ability to obtain additional liquidity. we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and cash provided by short-term and long-term borrowings, when necessary, will be adequate to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, capital expenditures and other obligations for the twelve months subsequent to the date of the issuance of this annual report and our long-term liquidity requirements. we do not have any restrictions that prevent or limit our ability to declare or pay dividends.
while a significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities are generated within the u.s., our cash balances include cash held outside the u.s. and in currencies other than the usd. as of december 31, 2022, approximately 76% of our cash and cash equivalents were located outside the u.s., largely denominated in foreign currencies. the recent fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and may continue to have a material impact on these foreign cash balances. cash balances in foreign countries are often subject to additional restrictions and covenants. we may, therefore, have difficulties timely repatriating cash held outside the u.s., and such repatriation may be subject to tax. these limitations may affect our ability to fully utilize our cash resources for needs in the u.s. and other countries and may adversely affect our liquidity. to the extent necessary, we accrue for tax consequences on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as they are earned. we may utilize tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. we periodically review and evaluate these plans and strategies, including externally committed and non-committed credit agreements accessible by our company and each of our operating subsidiaries. we believe these financing arrangements, along with the cash generated from the operations of our u.s. business, are sufficient to fund our current cash needs in the u.s.
guarantor information sec registered securities for purposes of this disclosure, including the tables, "parent issuer" shall mean mcbc. "subsidiary guarantors" shall mean certain canadian and u.s. subsidiaries reflecting the substantial operations of our americas segment.
pursuant to the indenture dated may 3, 2012 (as amended, the "may 2012 indenture"), mcbc issued its outstanding 3.5% senior notes due 2022 and 5.0% senior notes due 2042. the 3.5% senior notes were subsequently repaid in may 2022 upon maturity using a combination of commercial paper borrowings and cash on hand. additionally, pursuant to the indenture dated july 7, 2016 ("july 2016 indenture"), mcbc issued its outstanding 3.0% senior notes due 2026, 4.2% senior notes due 2046 and 1.25% senior notes due 2024. the issuances of the senior notes issued under the may 2012 indenture and the july 2016 indenture were registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended. these senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain subsidiaries of mcbc, which are listed on exhibit 22 of this annual report on form 10-k (the "subsidiary guarantors", and together with the parent issuer, the "obligor group"). "parent issuer" in this section is specifically referring to mcbc in its capacity as the issuer of the senior notes under the may 2012 indenture and the july 2016 indenture. each of the subsidiary guarantors is 100% owned by the parent issuer. the guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several.
none of our other outstanding debt was issued in a transaction that was registered with the sec, and such other outstanding debt is issued or otherwise generally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the obligor group or other consolidated subsidiaries of mcbc. these other guarantees are also full and unconditional and joint and several.
the senior notes and related guarantees rank pari-passu with all other unsubordinated debt of the obligor group and senior to all future subordinated debt of the obligor group. the guarantees can be released upon the sale or transfer of a subsidiary guarantors' capital stock or substantially all of its assets, or if such subsidiary guarantor ceases to be a guarantor under our other outstanding debt.
see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 9, "debt" for details of all debt issued and outstanding as of december 31, 2022.
the following summarized financial information relates to the obligor group as of december 31, 2022 on a combined basis, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances between the obligor group, and excluding the investments in and equity in the earnings of any non-guarantor subsidiaries.

cash flows and use of cash our business historically generates positive operating cash flows each year and our debt maturities are generally of a longer-term nature. however, our liquidity could be impacted significantly by the risk factors described in part i, item 1a. "risk factors".
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of $1,502.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 decreased $71.5 million compared to $1,573.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the unfavorable timing of working capital and lower net income adjusted for non-cash add-backs, partially offset by lower income taxes paid and lower payments for incentive compensation. the unfavorable timing of working capital includes the prior year net repayment against various tax payment deferrals programs associated with the coronavirus pandemic.
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities of $625.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased $115.2 million compared to $509.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher capital expenditures as a result of significant investment in our americas breweries, partially offset by higher cash inflows from other investing activities.
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities of $889.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 decreased $282.7 million compared to $1,172.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower net debt repayments, partially offset by higher dividend payments and class b common stock share repurchases.
capital resources, including material cash requirements cash and cash equivalents we had total cash and cash equivalents of $600.0 million as of december 31, 2022, compared to $637.4 million as of december 31, 2021. the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from december 31, 2021 to december 31, 2022 was primarily due to capital expenditures, net debt repayments, including the repayment of our $500 million 3.5% usd notes which matured in may 2022, dividend payments, class b common stock share repurchases and unfavorable foreign currency impact, partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities and from the sales of properties and other assets.
see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, consolidated statements of cash flows for additional detail. the majority of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in a variety of highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. these investments are viewed by management as low-risk investments on which there are little to no restrictions regarding our ability to access the underlying cash to fund our operations as necessary. while we have some investments in prime money market funds at times, these are classified as cash and cash equivalents; however, we continually monitor the need for reclassification under the sec requirements for money market funds, and the potential that the shares of such funds could have a net asset value of less than one dollar. we also utilize cash pooling arrangements to facilitate the access to cash across our geographies.
working capital we actively manage working capital through inventory management as well as management of accounts payable and accounts receivable to ensure we are able to meet short-term obligations and we are effectively using assets to increase cash inflows.
borrowings we repaid our $500 million 3.5% usd notes upon maturity on may 1, 2022 using a combination of commercial paper borrowings and cash on hand. refer to part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 9, "debt" for details.
based on the credit profile of our lenders that are party to our credit facilities, we are confident in our ability to continue to draw on our revolving credit facility if the need arises. as of december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021, we had $1.5 billion available to draw under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, as there were no outstanding revolving credit facility or commercial paper borrowings.
we intend to further utilize our cross-border, cross currency cash pool as well as our commercial paper programs for liquidity as needed. we also have cad, gbp and usd overdraft facilities across several banks should we need additional short-term liquidity.
under the terms of each of our debt facilities, we must comply with certain restrictions. these include customary events of default and specified representations, warranties and covenants, as well as covenants that restrict our ability to incur certain additional priority indebtedness (certain thresholds of secured consolidated net tangible assets), certain leverage threshold percentages, create or permit liens on assets and restrictions on mergers, acquisitions and certain types of sale lease-back transactions.
the maximum net debt to ebitda leverage ratio, as defined by the amended revolving credit facility agreement, was 4.00x as of december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021. as of december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of these restrictions and covenants, have met such financial ratios and have met all debt payment obligations. all of our outstanding senior notes as of december 31, 2022 rank pari-passu.
in october 2021, we further amended our existing revolving credit facility agreement to replace libor with designated replacement rates for any future borrowings denominated in eur or gbp to ensure continued, uninterrupted access to these markets should we need it.
see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 9, "debt" for further discussion of our borrowings and available sources of borrowings, including lines of credit.

capital expenditures we incurred $694.7 million, and paid $661.4 million, for capital improvement projects worldwide for the year ended december 31, 2022, excluding capital spending by equity method joint ventures, representing an increase of $136.1 million from the $558.6 million of capital expenditures incurred for the year ended december 31, 2021. this increase was primarily due to significant investment in our americas breweries including the completion of a new brewery in québec, canada and the sustainability investment in our golden, colorado brewery. we continue to focus on where and how we employ our planned capital expenditures, with an emphasis on strengthening our focus on required returns on invested capital as we determine how to best allocate cash within the business.
contingencies we are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, environmental litigation and indemnities associated with our sale of kaiser to femsa. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 13, "commitments and contingencies" for further discussion.
off-balance sheet arrangements refer to part ii-item 8 financial statements, note 13, "commitments and contingencies" for discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements. as of december 31, 2022, we did not have any other material off-balance sheet arrangements.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make judgments and estimates that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. our estimates are based on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. we review the underlying factors used in our estimates regularly, including reviewing the significant accounting policies impacting the estimates, to ensure compliance with u.s. gaap. however, due to the uncertainty inherent in our estimates, actual results may be materially different. we have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to understanding and evaluating the financial results reported in our consolidated financial statements.
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 1, "basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies".
pension and other postretirement benefits our defined benefit pension plans cover certain current and former employees in the u.s., canada and the u.k. benefit accruals for the majority of employees in our u.s. and u.k. plans have been frozen and the plans are closed to new entrants. in the u.s., we also participate in, and make contributions to, multi-employer pension plans. our opeb plans provide medical benefits for retirees and their eligible dependents as well as life insurance and, in some cases, dental and vision coverage, for certain retirees in the u.s., canada, and europe. the u.s., canada and u.k. defined benefit pension plans are primarily funded, but all opeb plans are unfunded. we also offer defined contribution plans in each of our segments.
accounting for pension and opeb plans requires that we make assumptions that involve considerable judgment which are significant inputs in the actuarial models that measure our net pension and opeb obligations and ultimately impact our earnings. these include the discount rate, long-term expected rate of return on assets, and plan asset fair value determination, which are important assumptions used in determining the plans' funded status and annual net periodic pension and opeb costs. further assumptions include inflation considerations and health care cost trends. we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. we also, with the help of actuaries, periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our net pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related expense. the following discussion focuses on assumptions that are deemed to have the most material impact on our pension and opeb liabilities and net periodic benefit cost.
discount rates the assumed discount rates are used to present-value future benefit obligations based on each plan's respective estimated duration. our pension and opeb discount rates are based on our annual evaluation of high quality corporate bonds in various markets based on appropriate indices and actuarial guidance. we believe that our discount rate assumptions are appropriate; however, significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and opeb obligations and related expense.
as of december 31, 2022, on a weighted-average basis, the discount rates used were 5.01% for our defined benefit pension plans and 4.90% for our opeb plans. the change from the weighted-average discount rates of 2.27% for our defined benefit pension plans and 2.59% for our opeb plans as of december 31, 2021 is primarily due to increasing interest rates in 2022.
a 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumptions would have had the following effects on the projected benefit obligation balances as of december 31, 2022 for our pension and opeb plans:

our u.k. pension plan includes benefits linked to inflation. the above sensitivity analysis does not consider the implications to inflation resulting from the above contemplated discount rate changes. this sensitivity holds all other assumptions constant.
long-term expected rate of return on assets the assumed long-term expected return on assets is used to estimate the actual return that will occur on each individual funded plan's respective plan assets in the upcoming year. we determine each plan's eroa with substantial input from independent investment specialists, including our actuaries and other consultants. in developing each plan's eroa, we consider current and expected asset allocations, historical market rates as well as historical and expected returns on each plan's individual asset classes. in developing future return expectations for each of our plan's assets, we evaluate general market trends as well as key elements of asset class returns such as expected earnings growth, yields and spreads. the calculation includes inputs for interest, inflation, credit and risk premium (active investment management) rates and fees paid to service providers. based on the above factors and expected asset allocations, we have assumed, on a weighted-average basis, an eroa of 4.91% for our defined benefit pension plan assets for cost recognition in 2023. this is an increase from the weighted-average rate of 3.11% we assumed for 2022, primarily due to the significant increase in interest rates throughout 2022 as 65.2% of our portfolio was invested in fixed income securities as of year end. we believe that our eroa assumptions are appropriate; however, significant changes in our assumptions or actual returns that differ significantly from estimated returns may materially affect our net periodic pension costs.
a 50 basis point change in our expected return on assets assumptions made at the beginning of 2022 would have had the following effects on 2022 net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs.

fair value of plan assets the fair value of plan assets is determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. however, considerable judgment is required in selecting an appropriate methodology and interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value, especially in the absence of quoted market values in an active market. changes in these assumptions or the use of different market inputs may have a material impact on the estimated fair values or the ultimate amount at which the plan assets are available to satisfy our plan obligations.
equity assets are diversified between domestic and other international investments. relative allocations reflect the demographics of the respective plan participants. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 11, "employee retirement plans and postretirement benefits" for a comparison of target asset allocation percentages to actual asset allocations as of december 31, 2022.
health care cost trend rates the assumed health care cost trend rates represent the rates at which health care costs are assumed to increase and are based on actuarial input and consideration of historical and expected experience. we use these trends as a significant assumption in determining our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs. changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care will impact this trend rate. an increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense of our postretirement health care plan. we believe that our health care cost trend rate assumptions are appropriate; however, significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our postretirement benefit obligations and related costs. as of december 31, 2022, the health care trend rates used were ranging ratably from 6.50% in 2023 to 3.57% in 2040, as compared to health care trend rates ranging ratably from 6.00% in 2022 to 3.57% in 2040 as of december 31, 2021. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 11, "employee retirement plans and postretirement benefits" for further information.
contingencies, environmental and litigation reserves contingencies, environmental and litigation reserves are recorded when probable, using our best estimate of loss. this estimate, involving significant judgment, is based on an evaluation of the range of loss related to such matters and where the amount and range can be reasonably estimated. these matters are generally resolved over a number of years and only when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. following our initial determination, we regularly reassess and revise the potential liability related to any pending matters as new information becomes available. unless capitalization is allowed or required by u.s. gaap, environmental and legal costs are expensed when incurred. we disclose pending loss contingencies when the loss is deemed reasonably possible, which requires significant judgment. as a result of the inherent uncertainty of these matters, the ultimate conclusion and actual cost of settlement may materially differ from our estimates. we recognize contingent gains upon the determination that realization is assured beyond a reasonable doubt, regardless of the perceived probability of a favorable outcome prior to achieving that assurance. in the instance of gain contingencies resulting from favorable litigation, due to the numerous uncertainties inherent in a legal proceeding, gain contingencies resulting from legal settlements are not recognized in income until cash or other forms of payment are received. if significant and probable, we disclose as appropriate.
see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 13, "commitments and contingencies" for a discussion of our contingencies, environmental and litigation reserves as of december 31, 2022.
goodwill and intangible asset valuation we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that may indicate potential impairment. our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets was performed as of october 1, the first day of the last fiscal quarter. we evaluate our other definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when evidence exists that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. significant judgments and assumptions are required in such impairment evaluations. as of december 31, 2022, the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets were approximately $5.3 billion and $12.8 billion, respectively, with the goodwill balance entirely attributed to the americas reporting unit.
we use a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and market approaches to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units and an excess earnings approach to determine the fair values of our indefinite-lived brand intangible assets. our discounted cash flow projections include assumptions for growth rates for sales, costs and profits, which are based on various long-range financial and operational plans of each reporting unit or each indefinite-lived intangible asset. additionally, discount rates used in our goodwill analysis are based on weighted-average cost of capital, driven by the prevailing interest rates in geographies where these businesses operate, as well as the credit ratings, financing abilities and opportunities of each reporting unit, among other factors. discount rates for the indefinite-lived intangible analysis by brand largely reflect the rates supporting the overall reporting unit valuation but may differ slightly to adjust for country or market specific risk associated with a particular brand, among other factors. our market-based valuations utilize earnings multiples of comparable public companies, which are reflective of the market in which each respective reporting unit operates. the key assumptions used to derive the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets represent level 3 measurements.
fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. as a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows, specifically, an inability to execute on our strategic initiatives or an increase in costs driven by inflation or other factors that could significantly impact our immediate and long-range results and an inability to successfully achieve our cost savings targets, (ii) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing and/or degree (such as a global pandemic or recession), (iii) significant unfavorable changes in tax rates, (iv) volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors which could result in a higher weighted-average cost of capital, (v) sensitivity to market multiples; and (vi) regulation limiting or banning the manufacturing, distribution or sale of alcoholic beverages.
if actual performance results differ significantly from our projections or we experience significant fluctuations in our other assumptions, a material impairment loss may occur in the future. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 6, "goodwill and intangible assets" for further discussion and presentation of these amounts.
annual goodwill impairment test as of the october 1, 2022 testing date, the carrying value of the americas reporting unit was determined to be in excess of its fair value such that an impairment loss of $845.0 million was recorded. as this is a partial impairment of the reporting unit, the reporting unit is still considered to be at risk of future impairment. assets are considered to be at heightened risk of future impairment if the fair value does not exceed its respective carrying value by 15.0% or more. the decline in the fair value of the americas reporting unit in the current year was largely impacted by macroeconomic factors including an increase to the discount rate as a result of the recent rising interest rate environment as well as reductions in management forecasts and expectations due primarily to cost inflation pressures in the near to medium term and a softening beer industry in certain markets in which we operate. specifically, the discount rate used in developing our annual fair value estimates for the americas reporting unit in the current year was 8.75% based on market-specific factors, primarily the recent interest rate environment, as compared to 8.25% used as of the october 1, 2021 annual testing date.
current projections used for the americas reporting unit testing reflect growth assumptions associated with our continued plan to build on the strength of our iconic core brands, aggressively grow our above premium portfolio, expand beyond the beer aisle, invest in our capabilities and support our people and our communities, all of which are intended to benefit the projected cash flows of the business. while progress has been made on this strategy, including the increasing proportion of our above premium portfolio in the current year and the strengthening of our core brands, there is not enough historical data yet to comfortably predict future impacts and forecasted future cash flows are inherently at risk given that the strategies are still in progress. in addition, while we have included in our forecasted future cash flows estimates for expected cost inflation and adjusted our volumes to be reflective of the current beer industry trends, there is still inherent risk in achieving our goals. if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that further impairment charges may be recorded in the future. for example, a 50 basis point increase in our discount rate assumptions, which is within a reasonable range of our historical discount rate fluctuations, could have a significant or material impact on the fair value of the americas reporting unit holding all other assumptions and inputs constant.
as of the october 1, 2020 testing date, the carrying value of the emea&apac reporting unit was determined to be in excess of its fair value such that an impairment loss of $1,484.3 million, the full value of goodwill as of october 1, 2020, was recorded.
indefinite-lived intangible assets the fair values of the coors brands in the americas, the miller brands in the u.s, the carling brands in the u.k., and the staropramen brands in emea&apac continue to be sufficiently in excess of their respective carrying values as of the annual testing date, with each having over 15% cushion of fair value over book value.
we utilize level 3 fair value measurements in our impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. the future cash flows used in the analyses are based on internal cash flow projections based on our long range plans and include significant assumptions by management. the same macroeconomic factors impacting the discount rates of the americas reporting unit are relevant to the indefinite-lived intangible assets with the carling and staropramen brands in emea&apac being further impacted by the effects of cost inflation driven by the russia-ukraine conflict and the associated impacts on consumer demand and discretionary spending primarily in central and eastern europe. a 50 basis point increase in our discount rate assumptions would not have resulted in an impairment of any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.
definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets regarding definite-lived intangible assets, we continuously monitor the performance of the underlying assets for potential triggering events suggesting an impairment review should be performed or useful lives should be re-assessed.
during the first quarter of 2022, we identified a triggering event related to the truss joint venture asset group within our americas segment and recognized an impairment loss of $28.6 million, of which $12.1 million was attributable to the noncontrolling interest. the asset group was measured at fair value primarily using a market approach with level 3 inputs. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 6, "goodwill and intangible assets" and note 17, "other operating income (expense), net" for further details on these impairment losses.
no other material triggering events were identified in either 2022 or 2021 related to the definite-lived intangible assets or other definite-lived assets.
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with u.s. gaap. judgment is required in determining our consolidated provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. additionally, our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by many different tax authorities.
we are periodically subject to income tax audits in various foreign and domestic jurisdictions, which can involve questions regarding our tax positions and result in additional income tax liabilities assessed against us. settlement of any challenge resulting from these tax controversies can result in a variety of resolutions including no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits. we measure and record the tax benefits from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. our estimated liabilities related to these matters are adjusted in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations for examination expires or when additional information becomes available. our liability for unrecognized tax benefits requires the use of assumptions and significant judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. although we believe that the judgments and estimates made are reasonable, actual results could differ and resulting adjustments could materially affect our effective tax rate and tax provision.
when cash is available after satisfying working capital needs and all other business obligations, we may distribute current earnings and the associated cash from a foreign subsidiary to its u.s. parent, and record the tax impact associated with the distribution. however, to the extent current earnings of our foreign operations exist and are not otherwise distributed or planned to be distributed, such earnings accumulate. these accumulated earnings are not considered permanently reinvested in our foreign operations. the taxes associated with any future repatriation of undistributed earnings are anticipated to be insignificant.
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, including the reversal of existing temporary differences, historical and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. the realization of tax benefits is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction. in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income tax expense in the period a determination was made. likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income tax expense in the period such determination was made.
there are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions in which we do business. as discussed in part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 12, "income tax", we recognize the impacts of changes in tax law upon enactment, and therefore, proposed changes in tax law, regulations and rules are not reflected within our tax provision. as a result, such changes may, upon ultimate enactment, result in material impacts to our financial statements.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of welltower inc. presented in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap") for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this annual report on form 10-k. other important factors are identified in "item 1 - business" and "item 1a - risk factors" above.
on march 7, 2022, we announced our intent to complete an upreit reorganization. in february 2022, the company formerly known as welltower inc. ("old welltower") formed well merger holdco inc. ("new welltower") as a wholly owned subsidiary, and new welltower formed well merger holdco sub inc. ("merger sub") as a wholly owned subsidiary. on april 1, 2022, merger sub merged with and into old welltower, with old welltower continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of new welltower. in connection with the merger, old welltower's name was changed to "welltower op inc.", and new welltower inherited the name "welltower inc." effective may 24, 2022, welltower op inc. ("welltower op") converted from a delaware corporation into a delaware limited liability company named welltower op llc. following the llc conversion, new welltower's business continues to be conducted through welltower op and new welltower does not have substantial assets or liabilities, other than through its investment in welltower op.
unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to "welltower" mean welltower inc. and references to "welltower op" mean welltower op llc. references to "we," "us" and "our" mean collectively welltower, welltower op and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by welltower and/or welltower op.

the covid-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have material and adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the future. the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic impacts our operations and those of our operators and tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of vaccines, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, the overall pace of recovery, among others.
our seniors housing operating revenues are dependent on occupancy which has increased during the year ended december 31, 2022. as of december 31, 2022, nearly all communities are open for new admissions and allowing visitors, in-person tours and communal dining activities.
we have incurred increased operational costs as a result of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties, as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators related to the covid-19 pandemic, including increases in labor, personal protective equipment and sanitation. we expect total seniors housing operating expenses to remain elevated as many of these additional health and safety measures have become standard practice.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our triple-net operators are experiencing similar trends related to occupancy and operating costs as described above with respect to our seniors housing operating properties. however, long-term/post-acute care facilities are generally experiencing a higher degree of occupancy declines. these factors may continue to impact the ability of our triple-net operators to make contractual rent payments to us in the future. many of our triple-net operators received funds under the coronavirus aid relief, and economic security act ("cares act") paycheck protection program and provider relief fund.
business strategy our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in noi and portfolio growth. to meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.
substantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees and services and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. these items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. to the extent that our obligors/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments or operating distributions to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. to mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs and market conditions among other things. we evaluate the operating environment in each property's market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility. when we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. through these efforts, we generally aim to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.
in addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also aim to structure our relevant investments to mitigate payment risk. operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guarantees and/or letters of credit. in addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, resident fees and services and rental income represented 71% and 25%, respectively, of total revenues. substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments.
our primary sources of cash include resident fees and services, rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.
we also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. our investments generate cash from noi and principal payments on loans receivable. permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.
depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. it is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future. to the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. to the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. at december 31, 2022, we had $631,681,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $90,611,000 of restricted cash and $4,000,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations key transactions capital  the following summarizes key capital transactions that occurred during the year ended december 31, 2022:
•in march 2022, we completed the issuance of $550,000,000 senior unsecured notes bearing interest at 3.85% with a maturity date of june 2032.
•in april 2022, we entered into an amended and restated atm program (as defined below) pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to $3,000,000,000 of common stock from time to time. during 2022, we sold 37,905,638 shares of common stock under our current and previous atm programs via forward sale agreements, generating gross proceeds of approximately $3,280,798,000. the sale of these shares and the settlement of outstanding forward sales from prior years resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $3,715,971,000.
•in june 2022, we closed on an amended $5,200,000,000 unsecured credit facility with improved pricing across our term loans. the credit facility includes $4,000,000,000 of revolving credit capacity at a borrowing rate of 77.5 basis points over the adjusted sofr rate, $1,000,000,000 of usd term loan capacity at a borrowing rate of 85.0 basis points over the adjusted sofr rate and $250,000,000 cad term loan capacity at 85.0 basis points over cdor.
•we extinguished $399,066,000 of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 5.54% throughout 2022.

dividends our board of directors declared a cash dividend for the quarter ended december 31, 2022 of $0.61 per share. on march 8, 2023, we will pay our 207th consecutive quarterly dividend payment to stockholders of record on february 28, 2023.
key performance indicators, trends and uncertainties we utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. these indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and concentration risk. management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions, and for budget planning purposes.
operating performance we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders ("nics") per the consolidated statements of comprehensive income are the most appropriate earnings measures. other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo") and consolidated net operating income ("noi"); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by u.s. gaap. please refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" for further discussion and reconciliations. these earnings measures are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in december 2022, promedica relinquished to welltower its 15% interest in 147 skilled nursing facilities previously owned by the welltower/promedica joint venture in exchange for a lease modification, which relieved promedica from its lease obligation on the 147 skilled nursing properties and amended the lease on the remaining 58 assisted living and memory care properties that continue to be held by the welltower/promedica joint venture. the 58 assisted living and memory care assets continue to be operated by promedica and backed by the existing guaranty.
concurrently with the above, welltower and integra healthcare properties ("integra") entered into master leases for the skilled nursing portfolio. approximately 15 regional operators will enter into subleases with integra to operate the properties. also in december 2022, we sold to integra a 15% ownership interest in 54 of those skilled nursing facilities for approximately $73 million. this transaction represents the initial tranche of the newly formed joint venture owned 85% by welltower and 15% by integra, which is anticipated to include the 147 skilled nursing facilities. in january 2023, integra acquired a 15% interest in 31 of the remaining 93 skilled nursing facilities for approximately $74 million, representing the second tranche of the well/integra joint venture. integra is expected to buy into the remaining 62 assets throughout 2023.
promedica noi for the year ended december 31, 2022 was comprised of $59,687,000 relating to the 58 assisted living and memory care properties (3% of total noi) and $180,441,000 relating to the 147 skilled nursing properties (8% of total noi).

the change in new development is primarily due to the number and size of construction projects on-going during the relevant periods. renovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements include expenditures to maximize property value, increase net operating income, maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization. the increase in overall development and recurring capital expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions is due primarily to portfolio growth and increased spending after a contraction during the pandemic.
financing activities  the changes in net cash provided from/used in financing activities are primarily attributable to changes related to our long-term debt arrangements, the issuances of common stock and dividend payments which are summarized above in "key transactions." please refer to notes 10, 11 and 14 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

capital structure please refer to "credit strength" above for a discussion of our leverage and coverage ratio trends. our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. certain agreements require us to maintain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. as of december 31, 2022, we were in compliance in all material respects with the covenants under our debt agreements. none of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. however, under our primary unsecured credit facility, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest charged. we plan to manage the company to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.

a portion of our earnings are derived primarily from long-term investments with predictable rates of return. these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes, secured debt and borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility. during inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs.

resident fees and services and property operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to acquisitions and construction conversions, including the acquisition of the holiday retirement portfolio on july 30, 2021 for a total purchase price of $1.6 billion. additionally, our seniors housing operating revenues are dependent on occupancy, which has steadily increased during 2022. as of december 31, 2022, nearly all communities are open for new admissions and allowing visitors, in-person tours and communal dining activities. average occupancy is as follows:

effective on april 1, 2022, our leasehold interest relating to the master lease with national health investors, inc. ("nhi") for 17 properties assumed in conjunction with the holiday retirement acquisition was terminated as a result of the transition or sale of the properties by nhi. the lease termination was part of an agreement to resolve outstanding litigation with nhi. in conjunction with the agreement, a wholly owned subsidiary and the lessee on the master lease agreed to release $6,883,000 of cash to the landlord, which represents the net cash flow generated from the properties since we assumed the leasehold interest. additionally, in conjunction with the lease termination, during the year ended december 31, 2022 we recognized $58,621,000 in other income on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, from the derecognition of the right of use asset and related lease liability.
property-level operating expenses associated with the covid-19 pandemic relating to our seniors housing operating portfolio totaled $33,099,000, $63,681,000 and $110,719,000 for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. these expenses were incurred as a result of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties, as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators related to the covid-19 pandemic, including increases in labor and property cleaning expenses and expenditures related to our efforts to procure personal protective equipment ("ppe") and supplies. we expect total seniors housing operating expenses to remain elevated as certain of these additional health and safety measures have become standard practice.

during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded impairment charges of $13,146,000 related to one held for sale property in which the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we recorded impairment charges of $22,317,000 related to two held for use properties in which the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value. transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of the purchase price. the fluctuation in other expenses is primarily due to the timing of noncapitalizable transaction costs associated with acquisitions and operator transitions. changes in the gain on sales of properties are related to the volume and timing of property sales and the sales prices.
depreciation and amortization fluctuates as a result of acquisitions, disposition and transitions. to the extent we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.

the majority of our seniors housing operating properties are formed through partnership interests. income from unconsolidated entities recognized during the year ended december 31, 2021 includes a gain recognized from the sale of a home health business owned by one of our unconsolidated entities. net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners' share of net income (loss) related to joint ventures. the decrease compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 relates primarily to our partners' share of reserves for previously recognized straight-line receivables.

rental income has increased primarily due to the timing of the establishment of reserves for straight-line rent receivable balances relating to leases for which collection of substantially all contractual lease payments is no longer deemed probable. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we recorded reserves for previously recognized straight-line rent receivables of $49,241,000 which resulted in reduced rental income for the period. offsetting the impact of straight-line changes, we have disposed of ten properties with a book value of $89,827,000 during 2022 and 51 properties with a book value of $486,369,000 during 2021.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant's properties. these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. if gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the consumer price index do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. for the year ended december 31, 2022, we had 50 leases with rental rate increasers ranging from 0.26% to 57.76% in our triple-net portfolio. our triple-net operators are experiencing similar impacts on occupancy and operating costs due to the covid-19 pandemic as described above with respect to our seniors housing operating properties. long-term/post-acute facilities have generally experienced a higher degree of occupancy declines, which in some cases impacted the ability of our triple-net operators to make contractual rent payments to us. however, many of our triple-net operators received funds under the cares act paycheck protection program and provider relief fund.
the increase to interest income during the year ended december 31, 2022 is primarily driven by interest recognized on senior loan financings of £540,000,000 made to affiliates of safanad as part of the recapitalization of its investment in hc-one group during the second quarter of 2021. additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2021, we recognized a provision for loan losses under the current expected credit losses accounting standard, primarily related to the initial recognition of that loan. the provision for loan loss recognized during the year ended december 31, 2022 is primarily related to $11,714,000 of specific reserves recognized on a held to maturity debt security, offset by the release of previously established allowances for credit losses due to loan repayments.

depreciation and amortization fluctuate as a result of the acquisitions, dispositions and transitions of triple-net properties. to the extent we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded impairment charges of $3,595,000 related to two held for use properties. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we recorded impairment charges of $26,579,000 related to four held for sale or sold properties and two held for use properties. transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of purchase price. the fluctuation in other expenses is primarily due to noncapitalizable transaction costs from acquisitions and segment transitions. changes in the gain on sales of properties are related to the volume and timing of property sales and the sales prices.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, there were no triple-net construction projects completed; however, four projects transitioned out of the triple-net segment and into the seniors housing operating segment. additionally, one project transitioned from consolidated to unconsolidated. the following is a summary of our consolidated triple-net construction projects, excluding expansions, pending as of december 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands):

a portion of our triple-net properties were formed through partnerships. income or loss from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net income or losses from partnerships where we are the noncontrolling partner. the increase in income from unconsolidated entities during the year ended december 31, 2022 is primarily related to the write off of a right of use asset and related lease liability on an unconsolidated joint venture that was restructured during the year. net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners' share of net income relating to those partnerships where we are the controlling partner. the decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021 is related to the increase in ownership in existing triple-net joint ventures.

rental income has increased due primarily to acquisitions and construction conversions that occurred during 2021 and 2022. certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index. these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. if the consumer price index does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. our leases could renew above or below current rental rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. for the year ended december 31, 2022, our consolidated outpatient medical portfolio signed 435,000 square feet of new leases and 1,826,000 square feet of renewals. the weighted-average term of these leases was seven years, with a rate of $38.19 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $26.77 per square foot. substantially all of these leases contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from 1.0% to 7.0%.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the decrease in interest income for the year ended december 31, 2022 is due primarily to a $178,207,000 first mortgage initiated in august 2020, which was subsequently repaid in full in june of 2021, resulting in the reversal of the previously established allowance for credit losses.
the fluctuation in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization are primarily attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions that occurred during 2021 and 2022. to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly.

during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recognized an impairment charge of $761,000 related to one held for use property. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we recognized an impairment charge of $2,211,000 related to one held for sale property. transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of purchase price. the fluctuation in other expenses is primarily due to noncapitalizable transaction costs. changes in gains/losses on sales of properties are related to volume of property sales and the sales prices.

the change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect of issuances and extinguishments, as well as the movement in foreign exchange rates and related hedge activity. please refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. the change in interest expense on our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program is due primarily to the net effect and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes. please refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information. loan expenses represent the amortization of costs incurred in connection with senior unsecured notes issuances. the loss on extinguishment recognized during the year ended december 31, 2021 is due primarily to the early extinguishment of $339,128,000 of our 3.75% senior unsecured notes due march 2023 and $334,624,000 of our 3.95% senior unsecured notes due september 2023.
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were 2.57%, 2.67% and 2.79%, respectively. other expenses includes non-capitalizable legal expenses, including related to our umbrella partnership reit reorganization during 2022. the provision for income taxes primarily relates to state taxes, foreign taxes and taxes based on income generated by entities that are structured as trss.
other non-gaap financial measures we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders, as defined by u.s. gaap, are the most appropriate earnings measurements. however, we consider ffo, noi, ssnoi, ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with u.s. gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. however, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. in response, the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") created funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo") as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. ffo, as defined by nareit, means nics, computed in accordance with u.s. gaap, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairment of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.
noi is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties. we define noi as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties. these expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to operators, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. general and administrative expenses represent general overhead costs that are unrelated to property operations and unallocable to the properties. these expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits related to corporate employees, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. same store noi ("ssnoi") is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. we believe the drivers of property level noi for both consolidated properties and unconsolidated properties are generally the same and therefore, we evaluate ssnoi based on our ownership interest in each property ("welltower share"). to arrive at welltower's share, noi is adjusted by adding our minority ownership share related to unconsolidated properties and by subtracting the minority partners' noncontrolling ownership interests for consolidated properties. we do not control investments in unconsolidated properties and while we consider disclosures at welltower share to be useful, they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution. as used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year-over-year reporting periods. acquisitions and development conversions are included in ssnoi five full quarters or eight full quarters after acquisition or being placed into service for the qtd pool and the ytd pool, respectively. land parcels, loans and sub-leases, as well as any properties sold or classified as held for sale during the respective periods are excluded from ssnoi. redeveloped properties (including major refurbishments of a seniors housing operating property where 20% or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more or outpatient medical properties undergoing a change in intended use) are excluded from ssnoi until five full quarters or eight full quarters post completion of the redevelopment for the qtd pool and ytd pool, respectively. properties undergoing operator transitions and/or segment transitions are also excluded from ssnoi until five full quarters or eight full quarters post completion of the transition for the qtd pool and ytd pool, respectively. in addition, properties significantly impacted by force majeure, acts of god, or other extraordinary adverse events are excluded from ssnoi until five full quarters or eight full quarters after the properties are placed back into service for the qtd pool and ytd pool, respectively. ssnoi excludes non-cash noi and includes adjustments to present consistent ownership percentages and to translate canadian properties and u.k. properties using a consistent exchange rate. we believe noi and ssnoi provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. we use noi and ssnoi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.
ebitda is defined as earnings (net income) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda excluding unconsolidated entities and including adjustments for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, gains/loss/impairments on properties, gains/losses on derivatives and financial instruments, other expenses, other impairment charges and other adjustments as deemed appropriate. we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda, along with net income, are important supplemental measures because they provide additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. we primarily use these measures to determine our interest coverage ratio, which represents ebitda and adjusted ebitda divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents ebitda and adjusted ebitda divided by fixed charges. fixed charges include total interest and secured debt principal amortization. covenants in our unsecured senior notes and primary credit facility contain financial ratios based on a definition of ebitda and adjusted ebitda that is specific to those agreements. our leverage ratios are defined as the proportion of net debt to total capitalization and include book capitalization, undepreciated book capitalization and market capitalization. book capitalization represents the sum of net debt (defined as total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash), total equity and redeemable noncontrolling interests. undepreciated book capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization. market capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for the fair market value of our common stock.
our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. additionally, these measures are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management. none of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with u.s. gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the table below reflects the reconciliation of ffo to nics, the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure, for the periods presented. noncontrolling interest and unconsolidated entity amounts represent adjustments to reflect our share of depreciation and amortization, gains/loss on real estate dispositions and impairment of assets. amounts are in thousands except for per share data.

(1) represents revenues and property operating expenses associated with a leasehold portfolio interest relating to 26 properties assumed by a wholly-owned affiliate in conjunction with the holiday retirement transaction. subsequent to the initial transaction, we purchased eight of the leased properties and one of the properties was sold by the landlord and removed from the lease. no rent was paid in excess of net cash flow relating to the leasehold properties and therefore, the net impact has been excluded from adjusted ebitda. additionally, in conjunction with the lease termination, during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recognized $58,621,000 in other income from the derecognition of the right of use asset and related lease liability which has also been excluded from adjusted ebitda.

critical accounting policies & estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. management considers an accounting estimate or assumption critical if:
•the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
•the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors. management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future. however, since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. please refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us and for the impact of new accounting standards, including accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us.

assessing impairment of real property involves subjectivity in determining if indicators of impairment are present and in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows or estimated fair value of an asset. in estimating the undiscounted cash flows or fair value, key assumptions that would be made are the estimation of future rental revenues, operating expenses, capitalization rates and the ability and intent to hold the respective asset, all of which are affected by our expectations of future market or economic conditions. these estimates can have a significant impact on the undiscounted cash flows or estimated fair value of an asset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  at december 31, 2022, our net real property owned was approximately $32,925,033,000. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded impairment charges of $13,146,000 related to one seniors housing operating property which was classified as held for sale for which the carrying values exceeded the fair values less costs to sell. additionally, we recorded $4,356,000 of impairment charges related to two triple-net properties and one outpatient medical property that were held for use in which the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values.

we believe that substantially all of our real estate acquisitions are considered asset acquisitions for which we record the related real estate acquired (tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities) at cost on a relative fair value basis. liabilities assumed and any associated noncontrolling interests are reflected at fair value. tangible assets consist primarily of land, building and improvements. identifiable intangible assets and liabilities primarily consist of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases. the total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with respect to that tenant.        during the year ended december 31, 2022, we completed $2,306,020,000 of real estate acquisitions. these transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

the consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and the accounts of joint venture entities in which we own a majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and where no substantive participating rights or substantive kick out rights have been granted to the noncontrolling interests. in addition, we consolidate those entities deemed to be variable interest entities ("vies") in which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
allowance for credit losses on loans receivable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  the determination of the allowance for credit losses is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments. we evaluate the collectability of our loans receivable based on a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, payment status, historical loan charge-offs, financial strength of the borrower and guarantors, and nature, extent and value of the underlying collateral. a loan is considered to have deteriorated credit quality when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. for those loans we identified as having deteriorated credit quality, we determine the amount of credit loss on an individual basis. placement on non-accrual status may be required. consistent with this definition, all loans on non-accrual are deemed to have deteriorated credit quality. to the extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is diminished, we may return these loans to income accrual status. while a loan is on non-accrual status, any cash receipts are applied against the outstanding principal balance. for the remaining loans, we assess credit loss on a collective pool basis and use our historical loss experience for similar loans to determine the reserve for credit losses.
the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. the determination of the credit allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recognized provision for loan losses of $10,320,000, which includes a specific reserve for a triple-net held to maturity debt security, offset by changes in the reserve based on our historical loss experience.
